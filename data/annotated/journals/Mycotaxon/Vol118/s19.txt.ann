[@Abstract — A monocentric blastocladialean fungus was identiﬁed as a parasite of
the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis in aquaculture and isolated into pure culture.
Phylogenetic analysis suggests the fungus is a sister taxon to the obligately biotrophic
plant parasitic genus Physoderma. The parasite, which has not been observed to reproduce
by zoospores, instead forms amoeboid aplanospores. We formally describe the new genus
and species Paraphysoderma sedebokerense to accommodate this unusual member of the
Blastocladiomycota.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@A fungal parasite of the green alga Haematococcus pluvialis has recently
been characterized (as “Haematococcus parasite” in Hoﬀman et al. 2008)
and provisionally referred to as “Paraphysoderma sedebokerensis” (Gutman
et al. 2009; Porter et al. 2011). The parasite has the appearance of a typical
chytridiomycete zoosporic fungus with an epibiotic globular sporangium
subtended by an intracellular rhizoidal system. It was ﬁrst observed during
aquaculture of H. pluvialis, an important producer of the carotenoid astaxanthin
used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals (Del Campo et al. 2007). Neither pure
nor dual cultures of the alga and fungus produced a zoosporic stage; instead
sporangia released amoeboid aplanospores that were infective to H. pluvialis
(Hoﬀman et al. 2008) but not other green algae (Gutman et al. 2009). In a
molecular phylogeny based on the 18S ribosomal RNA gene the novel parasite
was closely related but clearly basal to the plant parasitic zoosporic fungus
Physoderma (Blastocladiomycota) (Hoﬀman et al. 2008). Its phylogenetic

[@178 ... James & al.#Page-header*]
position, the absence of a zoospore stage, and its occurrence in an algal host
suggest that the parasite should be placed in a separate genus.
A detailed description of the infection cycle and growth characteristics of
the parasite has been published (Hoﬀman et al. 2008). The goal of this paper is
to provide a formal description of the parasite.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Paraphysoderma is diﬀerentiated from Physoderma by the absence of a
motile spore, the presence of an epibiotic resting sporangium, culturability,

[@Paraphysoderma sedebokerense, gen. et sp. nov. ... 179#Page-header*]

and host range. However, it has a general appearance of a typical monocentric,
eucarpic chytrid or blastocladialean fungus, and is similar to Physoderma in
having an epibiotic sporangium and a limited rhizoid emanating from a single
axis on the sporangium. Its phylogenetic position (Hoﬀman et al. 2008) implies
that the genus or species has recently lost a ﬂagellated spore stage. Despite the
absence of a motile spore, the aplanospores of the parasite are nonetheless able
to cause severe epidemics in aquaculture.
Our current observations do not exclude the possibility that additional study
of Paraphysoderma will ultimately reveal a zoospore stage. When sexuality is
observed in members of phylum Blastocladiomycota, an alternation of diploid
and haploid generations is observed (James et al. 2006). Thus it is possible that
a thallus or stage of diﬀerent ploidy on an alternative host may exist, although
infection studies suggest it is not likely to be another green alga (Gutman et al.
2009). However, the observation that the aplanospores from both resting and
thin-walled sporangia are morphologically similar suggests the absence of a
separate gametophyte stage. If the fungus conforms to the life cycles expected
of other blastoclads, then it would be considered to have a ‘Brachyallomyces’
(short) life cycle, which may or may not include meiosis during resting sporangial
germination (Emerson 1941). The basal placement of Paraphysoderma to
Physoderma is consistent with the derivation of the land plant parasitism from
an aquatic one between a chytrid-like fungus and an alga. The culturability of
Paraphysoderma and not Physoderma is consistent with the evolution of an
increasingly obligate parasitic relationship of Physoderma to its host. Indeed,
Physoderma and Paraphysoderma are unique among Blastocladiomycota in its
parasitism of the plant kingdom, although whether the use of plant hosts is a
derived or ancestral trait is unclear, as Physodermataceae occupy the most basal
branch in the Blastocladiomycota (Porter et al. 2011). The distinct diﬀerences in
culturability between the two genera suggests that Paraphysoderma might serve
as a model species for the clade in research requiring large numbers of cultured
cells, such as genomics and biochemistry.
The unique nature of the amoeboid swarming aplanospores suggests that
neither genus nor species has been observed before. Chytridiomycota species
that have been found to reproduce solely by amoeboid aplanospores include
Amoebochytrium rhizidioides Zopf (host: Chaetophora elegans (Chlorophyceae)),
Sporophlyctis rostrata Serbinow (host Draparnaldia spp. (Chlorophyceae)), and
Sporophlyctidium africanum Sparrow (host Protoderma sp. (Ulvophyceae)),
all of which diﬀer in several ways (including rhizoidal development) from
Paraphysoderma. An aplanosporic mode of reproduction is unusual among
aquatic fungi, and the factors that favor the loss of a ﬂagellated spore in an
aquatic environment are unclear. The pattern that many aplanosporic chytrids
parasitize green algae suggests that the need for a motile spore may be minimal

[@180 ... James & al.#Page-header*]
in certain well-mixed environments, while the ability to creep over the host to
ﬁnd an ideal location for rhizoidal penetration may the trait most inﬂuenced
by natural selection.
The number of accepted species of Physoderma is ~50 (Kirk et al. 2008). The
number of species and distribution of Paraphysoderma are currently unknown
but will probably be much greater than currently appreciated given the rapid
expansion of chytrid diversity seen in both culture studies and environmental
DNA surveys (Letcher et al. 2008; Freeman et al. 2009).#Comments*]
