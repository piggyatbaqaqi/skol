[@Abstract — Two new anamorphic fungi, Exserticlava manglietiae on decaying branches
of Manglietia chingii and Spiropes terminaliae on decaying branches of Terminalia mantaly,
are described and illustrated. The specimens were collected from subtropical rainforests in
Guangdong Province, China. Morphological diﬀerences between these two fungi and similar
species are summarized.#Abstract*]

[@Hughes (1978) introduced Exserticlava to accommodate Cordana vasiformis
Matsush. and C. triseptata Matsush., two species originally described on wood
and bamboo from Japan (Matsushima 1975). Exserticlava is characterized
by thick-walled, distoseptate conidia from polyblastic, funnel-shaped
conidiogenous cells borne on mononematous, simple conidiophores (Tsui et al.
2001a). Exserticlava is similar to Cacumisporium Preuss and Chloridium Link
in having sympodulo-phialides (Cole & Samson 1979) and holoblastic conidia
formed from the apex of polyblastic conidiogenous cells. Cacumisporium
diﬀers from Exserticlava in euseptate conidia and cylindrical conidiogenous
cells (Tsui et al. 2001b). Conidia in Chloridium are hyaline and aseptate (Gams
& Holubová-Jechová 1976).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ciferri (1955) established Spiropes with S. guareicola (F. Stevens) Cif. as type
species. The genus is characterized by macronematous unbranched sometimes
geniculate conidiophores, polyblastic, terminal and intercalary, sympodial
cicatrized conidiogenous cells, numerous and conspicuous scars, and solitary
acropleurogenous most commonly obclavate conidia with 1–9 transverse septa
or distosepta.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During continuing research on saprobic fungi in subtropical forests of
Guangdong Province, China, we collected two hyphomycetes that possess
the morphological characteristics of Exserticlava and Spiropes. They diﬀer
morphologically from any described species and are, therefore, proposed as
new to science. The type specimens are deposited in HSAUP (Herbarium of
the Department of Plant Pathology, Shandong Agricultural University) and
HMAS (Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy
of Sciences).#Misc-exposition*]

Conidia acrogenous, holoblastic, solitary, dry, smooth, ellipsoid, thick-walled,
1-distoseptate, very pale brown, 14–16 × 9–11 μm, base truncate.
Notes: Exserticlava species are separated primarily based on conidial shape
and number of septa (Holubová-Jechová 1990). A key to species and a synopsis
of their characters were provided by Tsui et al. (2001a). Of the six previously
described Exserticlava species, E. manglietiae resembles E. globosa V. Rao & de
Hoog (Rao & de Hoog 1986) in possessing concolorous, thick-walled conidia
with a strictly median septum, but E. globosa produces spherical larger (17 ×
21 μm diam) verrucose conidia. Exserticlava uniseptata Bhat & B. Sutton and
E. yunnanensis L. Cai & K.D. Hyde also produce 1-septate conidia, but E.
uniseptata can be distinguished by its broadly obovoid, larger conidia (15–20 ×
11–14 μm) with a smaller basal cell and E. yunnanensis diﬀers in hemispherical,
pale brown to subhyaline, larger conidia (16–22 × 10–13 μm) with a smaller
apical cell.#Description*]

[@Notes: Of the known Spiropes species, S. terminaliae is closely related to
S. guareicola in possessing macronematous unbranched conidiophores where
the upper fertile part has geniculate proliferations and distoseptate conidia.
However, S. terminaliae diﬀers from S. guareicola in conidial shape, size, and
the number of septa. The conidia of S. guareicola are broadly fusiform, much
larger (25–52 × 10–13 μm), and with fewer septa (3–5).#Comments*]
