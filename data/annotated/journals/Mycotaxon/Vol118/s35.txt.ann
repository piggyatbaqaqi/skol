[@Abstract — The taxonomy of the Chytridiomycota has been in ﬂux between a classical
system based on thallus morphology and a new system based on zoosporic ultrastructure and
analyses of genetic sequences. Chytridiales sensu Sparrow has been divided into 7 orders plus
undescribed lineages. We found and brought into pure culture Cylindrochytridium johnstonii,
the type species of the genus, which heretofore has not been characterized by molecular
methods. We conﬁrmed that this species is a member of the Cladochytriales, but it does not
lie within a recognized family.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Molecular studies have led to new orders being segregated from the large
chytridiomycete order Chytridiales sensu Sparrow (Barr 1980; Letcher et al.
2006, 2008; Longcore & Simmons 2012; Mozley-Standridge et al. 2009; Simmons
et al. 2009), yet many genera and species were not represented in these studies
because they were unavailable in culture. Such species, which were classiﬁed
in the Chytridiales in the classical literature (e.g., Sparrow 1960, Karling 1977),
remain incertae sedis in the Chytridiomycetes. Therefore, when chytrids that
have not been studied with molecular tools are isolated into pure culture it
is appropriate to determine their taxonomic position in the new system and
provide photographs of developmental morphology. Reporting genetic data for
described species is intended to promote universal taxon concepts. The phylum
Chytridiomycota has previously relied on thallus morphologies and zoosporic
ultrastructure, both of which, at least to some extent, have led to paraphyletic
groupings (e.g. Chytridiales sensu Sparrow 1960, Chytridiales sensu Barr 1980)
compared to molecular phylogenies (James et al. 2000, 2006).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The genus Cylindrochytridium was described by Karling (1941) for C. johnstonii,
a species with unique developmental morphology that occurred on boiled grass
used as bait in samples of aquatic debris. Subsequently, C. johnstonii has been

[@294 ... Steiger, Simmons & Longcore#Page-header*]
reported from sites around the world, including New Zealand (Karling 1968),
South America (Marano et al. 2008a,b; Rocha & Pires-Zottarelli 2002), Europe
(Czeczuga et al. 2007), and India (Karling 1963), but no authors have reported
isolating this fungus into pure culture. Its phylogenetic position therefore has
remained unconﬁrmed. We found this species growing on the edge of onionskin
bait placed with algae and aquatic debris collected from Smith’s Fen (Schwintzer
1978) during a ﬁeld trip that was part of the 2008 centennial celebration of the
University of Michigan Biological Station in northern Michigan, USA. Herein
we report that C. johnstonii is a member of the Cladochytriales and support this
conclusion with molecular data. Also, we include photos of the development of
this chytrid in pure culture for comparison with the type description.#Misc-exposition*]

JE Longcore collected algae and plant debris on 22 Sep 2008 from Smith’s Fen (pH
= 5.7; Schwintzer 1978), University of Michigan Biological Station, Cheboygan County,
Michigan, USA. The sample was transported at ambient temperature in a Whirlpak®
plastic bag to our laboratory in Maine. We placed the aquatic sample in a ﬁnger bowl
at room temperature and baited it with pieces of boiled, white onionskin. After several
weeks we noted thalli with catenulated rhizoids on the bait. Most of the thalli grew at
the edges of the onionskin and produced long, cylindrical zoosporangia. We rinsed
the onionskin with a stream of distilled water and placed it in a depression slide with
distilled water. After ~1 hour, when many active zoospores could be seen, we added
the water to plates of TC agar (0.4 g tryptone, 4 g cellobiose, 10 g agar, 1 L distilled
water) containing 300 mg/L streptomycin and 200 mg/L penicillin G. We monitored
the isolation plates at 100× magniﬁcation by inverting them on the stage of a compound
microscope. After nearly two weeks, we selected Cylindrochytridium johnstonii,
recognized by its long, cylindrical zoosporangia, from among the other chytrids on
the isolation plate and removed thalli to clean plates of TC agar. We transferred the
isolate, designated JEL596, to mPmTG slants (Longcore 1992) in screw-topped 125 ×
20 mm culture tubes and maintained the stock tubes at room temperature. Stocks were
transferred at 3-month intervals. To document morphology and days to maturity, we
inoculated cultures on mPmTG agar in 9 cm Petri plates stored at 23 °C. To document
morphology on cellulosic substrates, we inoculated a ﬂask of sterilized lake water
containing pieces of white onionskin with thalli near maturity or with motile zoospores
present and incubated the ﬂasks at room temperature. We aseptically removed portions
of agar with thalli from plates and pieces of onionskin from ﬂasks to view the chytrid
by light microscopy. We photographed developmental stages with phase contrast and
Hoﬀman Modulation Contrast (HMC) optics on a Nikon E400 microscope (Nikon
Instruments, Melville, New York) equipped with a Spot RT digital camera (Diagnostic
Instruments, Sterling Heights, Michigan). Composite images of thalli through multiple
focus planes were assembled from overlapping micrographs of individuals in Adobe
Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, California).

DNA of JEL596 was extracted with Whatman® FTA card technology (Whatman
Ltd., Maidstone, Kent, UK; Borman et al. 2006, Simmons 2011). Segments of nucSSU
and nucLSU rDNA were ampliﬁed, sequenced, and aligned as in Simmons (2011) with
taxa from Cladochytriales (Table 1) after a BLAST search in GenBank grouped JEL596
within that order. A region of nucSSU rDNA was ampliﬁed with the NS1/NS4 primer
pair (White et al. 1990), as was a region of nucLSU rDNA with the LR0R/LR5 primer pair
(Rehner & Samuels 1994, Vilgalys & Hester 1990). The Akaike Information Criterion in
jModeltest 0.1.1 (Guindon & Gascuel 2003, Posada 2008) chose the TIM3+G model of
evolution for the combined dataset. We entered these parameters into MrBayes 3.1.2
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003), which ran for 1M generations, selecting every 100th
tree. A 50% majority rule phylogram was constructed and MP bootstrap and BPP values
were computed in PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord 2002) as in Simmons (2011).#Materials-methods*]

characters similar to Karling’s (1941, 1977) descriptions of C. johnstonii. On

single axis or multiple rhizoidal axes (Fig. 1A, B). The catenulations and the

slowly as the rhizoidal system expanded through the agar (Fig. 1B). After nearly
two weeks, one side of the spherical zoosporangium elongated to form a tube
nearly as wide as the spherical base (Fig. 1E). Most of the cytoplasm migrated
toward the apical portion of the broad tube, leaving a highly vacuolated portion
at the zoosporangium base (Fig. 1F, I). At maturity, the basal portion of the
zoosporangium was empty and may have been walled oﬀ by a septum (Fig. 1F).
Zoospores exited the zoosporangium through a pore made by the complete
detachment of an apical operculum (Fig. 1H). Zoospores possessed a single
lipid globule (Fig. 1G, H), and ﬂagella were ~35 μm long.
Our attempts to reintroduce C. johnstonii to onionskin led to the production
of germlings, but after 1 month, no further development occurred. On onionskin
isolate JEL596 developed exogenously. The amber, ovoid zoospore cyst on the
surface of the onionskin had a cell wall with ridges and generally possessed a
single, large lipid globule (Fig. 1C). Germlings possessed one or two rhizoidal
axes with catenulations (Fig. 1D).#Description*]
[@Phylogenetics — A majority rule Bayesian phylogram (Fig. 2) was
constructed from a data matrix with 337 parsimony-informative characters of a
total matrix of 1410 characters. The phylogeny indicates that Cylindrochytridium
johnstonii is within the Cladochytriales. The species is in a clade that is sister to
a clade containing the type species of Allochytridium Salkin (Salkin 1970) and
Septochytrium Berdan (Berdan 1939), which are the only two genera recognized
in Septochytriaceae (Mozley-Standridge et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Our phylogeny (Fig. 2) places Cylindrochytridium johnstonii as sister to an
isolate with Catenochytridium morphology (JEL145). Together these two taxa
are sister to a group of isolates in the Septochytriaceae (Mozley-Standridge
et al. 2009) and are also part of a larger clade (Fig. 2), whose members form
large catenulations in their rhizoids. One species in this clade, Allochytridium
expandens Salkin, also has an elongated zoosporangium, but not to the extent
seen in C. johnstonii. Additionally distinguishing these two taxa, A. expandens
develops exogenously both in natural substrates and on agar medium (Barr
1986) whereas C. johnstonii develops endogenously on agar medium.
Shanor (1944) commented upon the resting spore of C. johnstonii, but he did
not illustrate this feature. He described the resting spore on ﬁlter paper as being
light-brown or amber, nearly spherical, with a smooth, thick cell wall and one
large yellow oil globule. This description is very similar to that of the zoospore
cyst that we saw on onionskin, but ﬁne ridges appeared on the surface of most
zoospore cysts we observed. Though the amber zoospore cysts on onionskin
may look like resting spores, their connection to larger portions of the thallus
(Fig. 1D) lead us to conclude they are zoospore cysts. Thus, we believe Shanor
may have mistaken the zoospore cyst for a resting spore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Karling (1941) illustrated elongation of C. johnstonii thalli as beginning
during growth of the germling, with some zoosporangia having basal swellings.
The developing zoosporangia we examined on agar were spherical (Fig. 1B) and
grew an apical elongation only when nearly mature (Fig. 1E, F, I). Additionally,
young thalli of our isolate on onionskin were also spherical (Fig. 1D).
Considering that Karling (1941) observed C. johnstonii in gross culture
and we studied our isolate in pure culture, our observations agree well with
his drawings, which constitute the type of C. johnstonii. Cylindrochytridium
endobioticum Willoughby (Willoughby 1964) is the only other species in the
genus, but Karling (1977) considered it to be a dubious member because of its
considerable variation from C. johnstonii. Our genetic information provides
the basis for adding additional species to the genus as well as evaluating the
suitability of the genus for C. endobioticum, when it is found and brought into
culture.#Misc-exposition*]
