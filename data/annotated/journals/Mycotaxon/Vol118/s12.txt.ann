[@Abstract — A new species of Eremiomyces is described from central Spain. Eremiomyces
magnisporus is proposed to accommodate a single collection found in July 2010 in a marlgypsicolous soil at Mount Gurugú, Alcalá de Henares (Spain). The habitat and macro-/
micromorphology of the fresh material are described. Molecular analyses of ITS and nLSU
DNA support the new species as closely related to but distinct from Eremiomyces echinulatus
from the Kalahari desert.#Abstract*]
[@Key words — Kalahari truﬄes, Mediterranean, hypogeous fungi#Key-words*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The genus Eremiomyces Trappe & Kagan-Zur must be considered as a
member of the Pezizaceae Dumort. (Pezizales J. Schröt.) since it was proposed
by Ferdman et al. (2005) to accommodate the molecularly deviant species
Choiromyces echinulatus Trappe & Marasas [≡ E. echinulatus (Trappe & Marasas)
Trappe & Kagan-Zur]. Eremiomyces echinulatus is a truﬄe of the African
Kalahari, collected in South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia (Trappe et al. 2008,
2010) and, until now, the only known species in this genus.
In the present work, a second Eremiomyces species is described from the
steppe-like semi-arid hills around Alcalá de Henares, central Spain. These
low hills present a marl-gypsum soil covered by introduced Pinus halepensis
as well as indigenous xerophilous shrubs such as Macrochloa tenacissima,
a Mediterranean poaceous plant with an Iberian and northern African
distribution (Figs. 1–2). Other fungi previously collected in this region
include Battarrea phalloides (Dicks.) Pers., Dictyocephalos attenuatus (Peck)
Long & Plunkett, Galeropsis desertorum var. bispora (Vassilkov) G. Moreno
et al., Gastrosporium simplex Mattir., Tulostoma spp., and Phaeomyces ibericus
(G. Moreno & Esteve-Rav.) E. Horak.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
[@Morphology#Section-header*]

The type material is preserved in the herbarium of the Dept. of Plant Biology,
University of Alcalá de Madrid (AH). Microscopical observations were recorded
from tissues mounted in KOH 5%, lactophenol cotton blue, and congo red. Spore
measurements do not include superﬁcial structures. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images were taken at the University of Alcalá de Henares, using a Zeiss DSM-950
instrument.
[@DNA extraction, PCR ampliﬁcation, and DNA sequencing#Section-header*]

DNA extraction, PCR ampliﬁcation, and amplicon puriﬁcation from type collection
AH 38981 was performed as described previously (Alvarado et al. 2010). PCR primers
ITS1F and ITS4 (Gardes & Bruns 1993), and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) for the ITS region,
and LR1 and LR7 (van Tuinen et al. 1998, Vilgalys & Hester 1990) for the nLSU rDNA
region were employed for PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing purposes. Sequences were
visually inspected for reading errors in MEGA4 (Tamura et al. 2007).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis

The obtained sequences were aligned with the closest matches from BLAST searches
in the public databases. ITS and nLSU sequences came mainly from Læssøe & Hansen
(2007) and Perry et al. (2007). Sequences were aligned in MEGA4.0 software using
its ClustalW application. The ﬁnal alignment was assembled manually. Neighbourjoining phylogenetic inference was performed in MEGA4 (pairwise deletion of gaps,
2000 bootstrap replicates). The aligned loci were loaded in PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord
2001) and a maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction was performed
(2000 bootstrap replicates, TBR swapping algorithm, 50 sequence additions per
replicate, MULTrees not in eﬀect). Aligned loci were also subjected to MrModeltest 2.3
(Nylander 2004) in PAUP* 4.0b10 to search for the evolutionary models that best ﬁt
the data. These models were simulated during the analysis of each locus in MrBayes 3.1
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). A Bayesian maximum likelihood (BML) analysis using
4 metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) was performed setting the
temperature of the chains to 0.2 and sampling once each 100 generations. The analysis
was run until convergence parameters were met in two simultaneous runs, after about
2M generations. A full search for the highest scoring ML trees was also performed in
RAxML (Stamatakis 2006) using the standard search algorithm, a thousand bootstrap
replications, and allowing an independent evolutionary model for each locus.

[@Molecular results#Section-header*]

The ﬁnal alignment of the ITS region included 327 of 658 variable sites,
288 of which were also parsimony-informative. In turn, nLSU alignment
included 114 parsimony-informative among 151 variable sites from a total 592
bases. Both ITS and nLSU data were best described by the evolutionary model
GTR+G+I.#Materials-methods*]

veins irregularly distributed forming a variable reticulated mesh with multiple
attachment points to the peridium, colour appearing darker where bitten by
animals; once dried, small [0.5–1.5 mm diam.] (sub)globose or subglobose

15.875, SD 0.545) without ornamentation, hyaline to slightly yellowish,
vacuolate; ornamented by densely arranged 1.5–2 × 1 µm blunt-edged rods
and cones reminiscent of Terfezia arenaria (Moris) Trappe, but clearly shorter
and more densely arranged. Asci and paraphyses could not be found due to
the advanced maturity of the sample, but spores remained linearly arranged,
commonly in groups of 4(–5) spores. Odour strong, similar to cottage cheese.#Description*]

[@Figure 2 shows the exact point of collection under M. tenacissima, without any
sign of the typical ‘burn’ associated with other hypogeous fungi. It cannot be
concluded which plant species was host of this presumably mycorrhizal fungus.
Kalahari truﬄes have been said to fruit under poaceous species: Enneapogon
cenchroides (Licht.) C.E. Hubb., Eragrostis rigidior Pilg., and Stipagrostis
uniplumis (Licht.) De Winter (Trappe et al. 2008). Interestingly, E. echinulatus
was collected in June during the austral winter (Trappe et al. 2010), while
E. magnisporus appeared in northern hemisphere during the summer.
Eremiomyces magnisporus is characterized by its pale brown peridium with
reddish areas that do not blacken after drying, large-sized spores (14–17 µm
without ornamentation), and a spore ornamentation formed by very densely
arranged blunt-edged hyaline to pale yellow cones. Eremiomyces echinulatus
is distinguished by a peridium that turns black after drying, dark brown glebal
veins, and smaller spores (10–14 µm without ornamentation).#Figure*]
[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Phylogenetic similarities between South African and Mediterranean
fungi have been reported before. The recently proposed inocybeoid genus
Tubariomyces Esteve-Rav. & Matheny is represented in both Spain and Italy
and Zambia (Alvarado et al. 2010). Tubariomyces species apparently associate
with Cistaceae Juss. in the Mediterranean and with Phyllanthaceae Martinov
and Fabaceae Lindl. in Zambia.
Macrochloa tenacissima, the putative host plant of E. magnisporus, is
commonly found in semiarid basic soils of the Mediterranean basin in Turkey,
Italy, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. In the western Mediterranean,
it reaches central Spain and several more scattered spots of northeastern Spain,
yet it is not found beyond the high plateaus preceding the Sahara desert to the
south and southwest of Morocco. Up to now, M. tenacissima has been regarded
as an exclusively endomycorrhizal plant, hosting glomalean species such
as Glomus aggregatum N.C. Schenck & G.S. Sm. and Funneliformis mosseae
(T.H. Nicolson & Gerd.) C. Walker & A. Schüssler (Roldán-Fajardo 1994).
Interestingly, the hypogeous fungus Gastrosporium simplex has also been found
in association with poaceous species of the Arrhenathero-Stipetum tenacissimae
association in the hills around Alcalá de Henares (Moreno et al. 1991) as well as
with Festuca ovina L. (Montecchi & Sarasini 2000).
Of the poaceous genera indicated by Trappe et al. (2010) as the most
probable hosts of the Kalahari truﬄes, those most closely related to Macrochloa
are Stipagrostis Nees, Eragrostis Wolf and Enneapogon Desv. ex P. Beauv.
Although widely distributed, Eragrostis is considered typical of subtropical
and xerophilous habitats and is common in Spain. Likewise, Enneapogon has
a split Australian–African distribution, with only E. desvauxii P. Beauv. being

widespread. Most African Enneapogon species range from south to northeastern
Africa, often reaching Arabia and India (Peterson et al. 2010). Only E. persicus
Boiss. reaches western Mediterranean to southeastern Spain. In turn, Stipagrostis
is found from southern Africa to Middle East and northwestern India, reaching
the western Mediterranean up to Morocco (Le Houérou 2001). It would be
interesting to search for this and other hypogeous genera in the distribution
areas of the poaceous species mentioned above. More research on Eremiomyces
and its unexpected plant hosts is clearly needed to shed light on its disjunct
geographical distribution#Misc-exposition*]
