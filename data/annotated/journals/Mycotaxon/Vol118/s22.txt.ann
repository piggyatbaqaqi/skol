[@Abstract — Neolecta vitellina, one of the rarely collected ascomycete species in Europe,
is reported from Romania for the ﬁrst time. The species was found on the ground, under
Norway spruce (Picea abies) in 2004, from the Nature Reserve “Tinovul Mare” Poiana
Stampei (Eastern Carpathians, Romania). Subsequent ﬁeld observations have conﬁrmed the
presence of Neolecta vitellina in the same location, in the period 2005–10. A description and
photographs of the specimens are presented.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The genus Neolecta Speg. belongs to the ascomycete family Neolectaceae
(Redhead 1977), order Neolectales (Landvik et al. 1993), class Neolectomycetes
(Taphrinomycotina, Ascomycota). This genus includes three accepted species
—N. ﬂavovirescens Speg., N. irregularis (Peck) Korf & J.K. Rogers, N. vitellina—
with clavate, unbranched to lobed yellow ascomata, up to about 7 cm tall
(Landvik et al. 2003). Of these three species, only N. vitellina has been reported
from Europe (Bresadola 1882, Geitler 1958, Hansen & Knudsen 2000: 48–50,
Krieglsteiner 1993: 421, Landvik et al. 2003, Ohenoja 1975, Redhead 1989).
Work published by European researchers about Neolecta vitellina refers mainly
to phylogeny, morphology and ultrastructure (Landvik 1996, 1998; Landvik
et al. 1993, 2001, 2003). The purpose of this paper is to report the presence
of Neolecta vitellina in Romania and to provide morphological and ecological
notes on this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

ascomata. Fresh specimens were photographed in situ prior to collection. Ascomata
were sectioned and mounted in Melzer’s reagent for observation of asci and ascospores
under the light microscope.
The ITS DNA sequence was generated from a dried Neolecta vitellina ascoma
(I 114506) that was crushed using a FASTPREP DNA extraction machine (Qbiogene,
Inc.). DNA was extracted from crushed material using a phenol-chloroform extraction
protocol. The ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) region was ampliﬁed by PCR using
primers ITS4 and ITS5 (http://www.biology.duke.edu/fungi/mycolab/primers.htm). We
used BlastN (Altschul et al. 1997) to query the GenBank database for similar sequences
and calculate percent identity and gaps. The obtained ITS sequence is deposited in
GenBank (accession number FJ171855.1).
Analyzed specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of Alexandru Ioan Cuza
University, Faculty of Biology, Iaşi, Romania (I) and Farlow Herbarium, Harvard
University, Cambridge, USA (FH).#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Neolecta vitellina is rarely collected in Europe, where it has a boreal-montane
distribution. The species has previously been reported in Norway, Sweden,
Finland (Hansen & Knudsen 2000), and Italy (Bresadola 1882, Geitler 1958).
In Romania, N. vitellina was found in the northern part of the country at the
periphery of “Tinovul Mare” Poiana Stampei peat bog on the ground among

[@200 ... Chinan & Hewitt#Page-header*]
mosses under Norway spruce (Picea abies). Our report represents the ﬁrst
record of this species for Romania and the Carpathian Mountains.
Two ascomata were ﬁrst found on October 2004. In July 2005, more specimens
were in the same location with 53 ascomata inventoried in approximately a 10
m2 area. Subsequent monitoring during 2006–10 has conﬁrmed its presence in
the same place and shown that late June and early July seem to be the optimal
time for Neolecta vitellina to form ascomata in Romania. For comparison,
Landvik et al. (2003) reported N. vitellina from Northern Europe in August
while Redhead (1977) reports the species from North America in August–
October. Additionally, a Bresadola collection of Geoglossum vitellinum from
Southern Tyrol (Italy) in the Patouillard collection at the Farlow Herbarium is
dated ‘Aug. 1889’, later than the fruiting time recorded herein for the Romanian
populations.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The macroscopic and microscopic characters of the specimens collected
from Romania are in accordance with the literature (Redhead 1977, Hansen &
Knudsen 2000, Landvik 2003) and the ITS sequence derived from one ascoma
(I 114506) matches those of other specimens identiﬁed as Neolecta vitellina.
We also conﬁrm that Neolecta vitellina ascomata are attached to Norway
spruce roots (Fig. 1B), on which was observed a whitish sleeve consisting
of mycelium. Regarding this aspect, Redhead (1979) mentions that Neolecta
vitellina is possibly a root parasite, based on morphology and the close
association of the hyphae and the roots to which the hyphae are attached.
The presence of this species in the Nature Reserve “Tinovul Mare” Poiana
Stampei, part of the European Ecological Natura 2000 Network,
emphasizes the importance of this site for macrofungi conservation.#Misc-exposition*]
