[@Abstract — An interesting agaric, Clarkeinda trachodes, is reported for the ﬁrst time from
Bangladesh. A full description, discussion, and illustrations are provided. The enigmatic agaric
genus, currently known only from south and southeast Asia, is characterized by the presence
of a fawn colored pellicle on the central pileus surface, a stipe with a superior annulus and
basal volva, and thick-walled pigmented spores with a slightly depressed truncated apex. Our
examination of a voucher specimen from Italy indicates that a recent report of Clarkeinda in
Europe was based on a misidentiﬁed Agaricus collection.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Taxonomic reports on macrofungi of Bangladesh are rare in the literature.
As a part of an ongoing eﬀort to document the macrofungi of South Asia,
we report the presence of Clarkeinda trachodes from Bangladesh for the ﬁrst
time. We provide a detailed morphological description, photographs, and line
drawings of this enigmatic agaric.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
During November 2009 and June 2010 specimens were collected several times in
two diﬀerent locations in Bangladesh: Bhawal National Park, Gazipur (24°45’N 90°50’E;
altitude 20 m), and Akhanagar, Thakurgaon, in northern Bangladesh, (26°03N’ 88°47’E;
altitude 67 m). Specimens were deposited in the SAU Herbarium of Agarics Flora
(SHAF; Plant Pathology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural
University, Dhaka, Bangladesh) and in the Kunming Institute of Botany Herbarium,
Academia Sinica (KUN, with HKAS numbers), Kunming, Yunnan, China.

[@332 ... Hosen & Ge#Page-header*]
Fresh specimens were described and photographed in the ﬁeld. Small tissue pieces
were dried in silica gel and the remaining basidiomes were dried using an oven. Color
codes follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1978).
Microscopical observations were made in mounts of H2O, glycerin, 5% aqueous
KOH, Congo red solution, and Melzer’s reagent, and at least 20 basidiospores were
measured for each of the six basidiomes collected. Q = average length/width ratio
derived from each basidiospore measured. Line drawings of microstructures were made
from the rehydrated specimens.
To prepare the basidiospores for scanning electron microscopy (SEM), silica dried
basidiome fragments were mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided tape, coated
with gold palladium, and photographed with a Hitachi S−4800 SEM.#Materials-methods*]

[@Figs 1-11#Figure*]
[@Basidiomata medium to large, ﬂeshy. Pileus 80 to 110 mm in diameter,
subglobose or hemispherical when young, and becoming convex to applanate
at maturity; pellicle brown (6E8) to coﬀee (6E5-6) or chocolate brown (6E5,
6F5), thin to thick when young and somewhat brown to grayish brown (7E35) at maturity; the remaining surface covered with grayish brown (7E3-5)
to vinaceous brown (6D8, 8E8) squamules, together with numerous, small,
revolute and loosely ﬂoccose, brown squamules; context up to 9 mm thick
in the center of the pileus, white, instantly turning reddish with exposure.
Lamellae 47 × 10 mm, free and remote from stipe, white to dirty white when
young, olive brown when mature, becoming red brown after bruising, crowded
with lamellulae, margin entire, concolorous. Stipe 80−121 × (28−)31−47(−61)
mm, central, subcylindrical, solid but ﬁstulose in aged specimens; surface dirty
white to white at the apex, light brown to brown toward the base, glabrous
above the annulus, lower half densely covered with minute, brown, furfuraceous
squamules. Annulus present on the upper part of the stipe but not the top, up
to 18 mm, thick and membranous and remaining up to the maturity, sometimes
detached from the stipe when dry, adaxial part glabrous with ﬁne longitudinal
striation but abaxial part rough with squamules. Volva present, grayish, dirty
white to white, membranous, usually closely appressed to stipe and eventually
inconspicuous. Spore deposit not obtained.
Basidia 18−26 × 6−9 µm, mostly clavate to subclavate, thin-walled,
tetrasporic (occasionally 2- or 3-spored), bearing four short sterigmata, 1.1−2.3
× 0.8−1.2 µm, hyaline, smooth, lacking incrustations, clamp connection absent.
Basidioles narrowly clavate to clavate. Hymenophoral trama interwoven,
hyphae cylindrical to slightly inﬂated, up to 14 µm wide, thin-walled, hyaline, and
without clamp connections. Basidiospores (Figs 3, 6−7) (5.0−)5.52−5.96(−6.8)
× (3.4−)3.81−3.98(−4.3) µm, mean Q = (1.38−)1.42−1.54(−1.7), ovoid, sometimes
broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, glabrous, thick-walled (up to 0.6 µm), apiculus

4−7 cells, slightly interwoven, terminal cells 12−22.5 × 8−14 µm, dull brown
vacuolar pigment inside the cells in glycerin, water and 5% KOH solutions,
thin-walled, clavate, cylindrical, obpyriform to fusiform or spindle-shaped in

[@Habit, habitat, distribution— The ﬂeshy basidiomes of C. trachodes fruit
as isolated individuals or in groups of two in disturbed habitats and at forest
edges. Our collections were found along the roadside near a Shorea robusta
(Dipterocarpaceae) forest in Bhawal National Park, Gazipur, and on bare soil
near a bamboo fence around a village residence in Akhanagar, Thakurgaon,
Bangladesh. Known also from China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sri
Lanka.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Comments — Clarkeinda trachodes is distinguished by a large basidiome size,
prominent chocolate or coﬀee brown to deep brown pellicle on the pileus disc
surface, presence of an annulus, olive brown to umber brown spore deposit,
slightly thick-walled spores with a truncated apex, and a context that changes
from white to reddish brown when cut. Since Berkeley (1847) ﬁrst described the
species from Sri Lanka, it has been reported from south and southeast Asia by
Petch & Bisby (1950, as Chitoniella), Leelavathy et al. (1981), and Pegler (1985,
1986). Yang (1991) has also reported it from the tropical region of Yunnan,
China.
Examination of the specimen from Italy reported as C. trachodes by Lavorato
& Contu (2002) shows the European record is based on a misidentiﬁed Agaricus
specimen. The Italian specimen bears larger, ellipsoid basidiospores (7−8.5 ×
4.5−5.5 µm) that lack a germ pore and truncated apex, and pileal squamules that
represent a cutis of ﬁlamentous cylindrical hyphae 4−8 (−15) µm in diameter.
