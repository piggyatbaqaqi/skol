[@Abstract — Two Corynespora species collected from northeastern Uttar Pradesh, India,
are described and illustrated: C. carrisae sp. nov. from living leaves of Carissa spinarum
(Apocynaceae) and C. peristrophicola sp. nov. from living leaves of Peristrophe bicalyculata
(Acanthaceae).#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Indian researchers have added several novel species to the anamorphic
genus Corynespora during the past few years (Meenu et al. 1997, Meenu &
Kamal 1998, Sharma et al. 2002, Jain et al. 2002, Pal et al. 2007, Singh et al.
2007, Kumar et al. 2008). During our recent survey, we encountered several
plant species exhibiting leaf blights. Upon critical examination and a thorough
survey of the literature, we found that two blights were caused by two new
Corynespora species: C. carrisae on Carissa spinarum L. (Apocynaceae) and
C. peristrophicola on Peristrophe bicalyculata (Retz.) Nees. (Acanthaceae). These
taxa are described and illustrated below.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Infected leaf samples from diﬀerent parts of northeastern Uttar Pradesh (U.P.)
were placed in separate polythene bags and taken to the laboratory. Suitable mounts
of surface scrapings and free-hand cut sections were prepared from infected portions
of the leaf samples. The material was mounted in a cotton-blue lactophenol mixture on
microscope slides. The slides were examined, the specimens were measured and camera
lucida drawings were made. Morphotaxonomic determinations were made with the help
of current literature and available resident expertise. Holotypes have been deposited
in HCIO (Herbarium Cryptogamiae Indiae Orientalis), Indian Agricultural Research

[@Remarks— Only one Corynespora species, C. alstoniae Meenu et al. (Meenu
et al. 1997), has been described on Apocynaceae. Compared with the present
collection, C. alstoniae has shorter and broader conidiophores (121–473.5 ×
6.0–13.5 µm) and conidia (48.5–154 × 8.5–21.5 µm). The hilum in C. carrisae is
thickened while in C. alstoniae it is unthickened.
Unbranched to branched and longer conidiophores (110–850 × 4–11 μm)
easily distinguish C. carrisae from C. cassiicola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei
(Wei 1950), which has unbranched, shorter conidiophores. Its 4–17-distoseptate
longer thinner conidia also contrast with the 4–20-distoseptate shorter thicker
(40–220 × 9–22 μm) conidia in C. cassiicola.

[@126 ... Singh & Kamal#Page-header*]
The new species appears to be most similar to C. euphorbiacearum Meenu
et al. (Meenu et al. 1997). Corynespora carrisae has more septa (4–18), more
successive cylindrical proliferations and longer conidiophores compared with
C. euphorbiacearum with 3–7-septate, shorter conidiophores (100–358 × 6–8
μm), and thickened noncatenate and narrower conidia separate C. carrisae
from C. euphorbiacearum conidia that are unthickened, solitary to catenate,
and broader (59–235 × 11.5–22.5 μm).
One other possible close relative is C. gigaspora (Berk. & Broome) M.B. Ellis
(Ellis 1957), which produces conidia that are longer and broader (100–270 ×
19–28 μm) with more distosepta (9–52).#Comments*]

[@Remarks— Only C. barleriicola N. Sharma et al. (Sharma et al. 2002) has is
known to occur on members of Acanthaceae. Corynespora peristrophicola has
shorter unbranched 5–18-septate conidiophores while those in C. barleriicola
are branched, 3–7-septate, and longer (253–479 × 7–9 µm). Furthermore,
C. barleriicola has longer conidia (41–246 × 10–18.5 µm), which are 3–17distoseptate with 0–5 distinct transverse band-like distosepta, and its hila are
unthickened.
The conidia of C. peristrophicola appear most similar to those of C. siwalika
(Subram.) M.B. Ellis (Ellis 1961: 88–140 × 15–20 μm), C. leptoderridicola M.B.
Ellis (Ellis 1957: 70–120 × 14–17 μm), and C. combreti M.B. Ellis (Ellis 1963b:
40–122 × 8–11 μm) but lack the rostrate morphology typical of the other
species. The 5–12 conidial distosepta in C. peristrophicola are slightly more
numerous than in C. combreti (4–10-distosepta) and less numerous than in
C. leptoderridicola (6–16-distosepta) and C. siwalika (9–19-distosepta).
The new species also resembles C. alstoniae (Meenu et al. 1997), which,
however, has longer broader conidiophores (121–473.5 × 6–13.5 μm) and
broader, catenate unthickened conidia (48.5–154 × 8.5–21.5 μm).
Other possible closely related species are separated by number of distosepta:
C. bdellomorpha M.B. Ellis (Ellis 1963a) with 12–19 and C. eranthemi J.M. Yen
& Lim (Yen & Lim 1980) with 5–25.#Comments*]
