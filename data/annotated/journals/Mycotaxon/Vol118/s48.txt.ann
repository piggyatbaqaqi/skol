[@Abstract — Sarcogyne plicata, a California endemic, is revised and discussed. A taxon
referred to in the literature as Sarcogyne “privigna,” which looks similar to S. plicata and is
sympatric in California, is discussed. The name is considered invalid for the taxon.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The type of Sarcogyne Flot. is S. corrugata Flot. (= S. clavus (DC.) Kremp.)
(Jørgensen & Santesson 1993). The genus currently comprises species with
lecideine apothecia with an excipulum of melanized (or even carbonized)
hyphae that lack any epihymenial accretions as are found in species currently
included in Polysporina Vězda. The exact number of species in the genus is
unknown, partly because the current generic circumscription is paraphyletic
(Reeb et al. 2004; Westberg, pers. comm.) and partly because many species
need revision or are known only from lost types (Knudsen & Standley 2007;
Lendemer et al. 2009b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In North America we currently recognize 15 described Sarcogyne species.
Twelve species are known from collections made in the last 15 years: S. arenosa
(Herre) K. Knudsen & S.M. Standl. (Knudsen & Standley 2007; Lendemer et
al. 2009a), S. clavus (Magnusson 1935a, b; Harris & Ladd 2005; Knudsen &
Standley 2007), S. crustacea K. Knudsen & Kocourk. (Knudsen & Kocourková

S. sphaerospora J. Steiner (Lendemer et al. 2009b). Three species are known
only from lost type collections: S. athroocarpa H. Magn., S. integra B. de Lesd.
ex H. Magn., and S. magnussonii B. de Lesd. (Magnusson 1935b; Knudsen &
Standley 2007). We have not seen any taxa ﬁtting the descriptions of these three
species that could be used for neotypiﬁcation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We are currently researching the biodiversity and taxonomy of the lichenized,
lichenicolous, and rock-inhabiting fungi of Joshua Tree National Park. In the
park, Sarcogyne plicata, originally described from California (Magnusson
1935b), is sympatric with S. “privigna.” Knudsen & Standley (2007) previously
treated S. plicata as a synonym of S. “privigna” because it was unclear how to
delimit many specimens from S. “privigna” as then interpreted (see discussion
below). Unpublished molecular work by Martin Westberg (Westberg, pers.
comm.) supported S. plicata as distinct from S. “privigna,” and we accepted both
species although we were still unclear how to diﬀerentiate the two (Knudsen &
Kocourková 2009). In this paper we revise Sarcogyne plicata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Specimens were examined from COLO, FH, NY, UCR, and UPS. Specimens were
studied in hand sections using standard microscopy. Structures were examined in water
and KOH and measured in water. Amyloid reactions were tested with IKI. Hymenial
height does not include the height of the subhymenium, a valuable secondary character
in distinguishing some species. Thin-layer chromatography was performed by J.C.
Lendemer on Sarcogyne plicata, Knudsen 1230 (NY) (Culberson & Kristinsson 1970).
Images were captured using an Olympus DP20 digital camera with Microsuite Special
Edition. The illustrations were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. All measurements are
based on water mounts of hand cut sections unless otherwise indicated.#Materials-methods*]

[@Sarcogyne plicata in California (USA) ... 427#Page-header*]

[@Ecology & distribution — Sarcogyne plicata is frequent in southern
California, often locally abundant, usually occurring on granite in drainages,
washes and ﬂood plains, often a solitary pioneer in full sun, at elevations from
200 to 1651 meters. A few collections from the Santa Monica Mountains are
on Conejo volcanics. No populations have been found on calcareous rock.
It is currently considered endemic to California, occurring in the Mojave
Desert (Granite Mountains and Joshua Tree National Park) and in the coastal
mountains and foothills of southern California in the Peninsular Ranges
(Menifee Hills, Santa Ana Mountains, San Jacinto Mountains) and in the
Transverse Ranges (San Bernardino Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, and
Santa Monica Mountains).#Habitat-distribution*]
[@Discussion — A typical S. plicata specimen (Fig. 1) is quite distinctive from
S. “privigna” (Fig. 2), but many specimens can be quite similar. For instance, a
S. plicata thallus with many round apothecia may resemble S. “privigna,” while
a S. “privigna” thallus with many compressed apothecia may be identiﬁed as
S. plicata. While S. “privigna” usually has discs that appear red even when
dry, some thalli have mostly blackish apothecia. Fortunately S. “privigna”

[@Fig. 2. Sarcogyne ‘privigna’ (Harris 42777).
Apothecia. Scale = 250 µm.#Figure*]

[@428 ... Knudsen & Kocourková#Page-header*]
discs always turn red when dampened with water while S. plicata discs
remain black. Otherwise S. plicata has a taller hymenium (100–140 µm) and
deeper subhymenium (50–80 μm) than S. “privigna” (60–85 µm and 30–40
µm, respectively). One site where both species occurred was in Joshua Tree
National Park at Key’s Ranch. The site has extensive monzogranite boulders
forming a maze of small alkaline washes, which commonly contain rock
crevices and ﬁssures rich in calcium deposited during seasonal ﬂooding and
subsequent evaporation. Sarcogyne “privigna” was common in these calcareous
microhabitats. Sarcogyne plicata was frequent in the more acidic microhabitats
found on the tops of monzogranite boulders that are not inundated during
ﬂooding and thus lack calcium deposits. In areas of the Mojave Desert like
Cactus Flats (San Bernardino Mountains) or in the Clark Mountains, where
limestone predominates, S. “privigna” was abundant and no S. plicata was
collected.
[@The problem of Sarcogyne “privigna” auct., non (Ach.) A. Massal#Section-header*]

[@Fig. 2#Figure*]

[@Lichenologists generally agree as to which taxon should be referred to
Sarcogyne “privigna” (for instance: Magnusson 1935a, b; Clauzade & Roux
1985; Golubkova 1988; Knudsen & Standley 2007; Seppelt et al. 1998; Fletcher
& Hawksworth 2009). However, the Acharius type of the basionym Lecidea
privigna Ach. 1803 (and thus Massalongo’s 1854 combination in Sarcogyne)
represents Polysporina simplex (Taylor) Vězda (Magnusson 1935a). The
Acharius types of the other possible basionym, Lecanora milvina var. privigna
Ach. 1810, appear to represent Polysporina simplex and/or an Acarospora. For
descriptions see Clauzade & Roux (1985), Magnusson (1935a, b), Knudsen &
Standley (2007), and Fletcher & Hawksworth (2009). Thus the S. “privigna”
now recognized by many authors does not have a validly published name
(Magnusson 1935a; Knudsen & Standley 2007).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sarcogyne plicata is restricted to a small area within the range of the more
cosmopolitan S. “privigna”. As noted above S. “privigna,” can generally be
separated from the often similar to S. plicata based on its shorter hymenium
and shallower subhymenium. The species also sometimes retains a vestige
of apothecial development in the form of an umbo in the center of the disc
that usually eventually disappears. Also as noted above, the easiest way to
diﬀerentiate the two species is that S. “privigna” discs (usually red or red-orange
when dry) are brighter when wet, while the black S. plicata discs remain black
even when wet. The S. “privigna” pycnidia we observed were ca. 0.1–0.2 mm
diam., while conidia were simple, hyaline, and 1.0–2.0 × 0.5–1.0 µm.#Comments*]
