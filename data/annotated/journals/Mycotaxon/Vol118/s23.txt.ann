[@Abstract — The holotype of Tothia fuscella has been re-examined and is re-described and
illustrated. An identical fresh specimen from Austria is used to designate an epitype with
herbarium material and a living culture. Sequence analyses show T. fuscella to be most closely
related to Venturiaceae and not Microthyriaceae, to which it was previously referred.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@We have been re-describing and illustrating the generic types of
Dothideomycetes (Zhang et al. 2008, 2009, Wu et al. 2010, 2011, Li et al. 2011)
and have tried where possible to obtain fresh specimens for epitypiﬁcation and
use molecular analyses to provide a natural classiﬁcation.
Our previous studies of genera in the Microthyriaceae, a poorly known
family within the Dothideomycetes, have resulted in several advances (Wu et
al. 2010, 2011). The Microthyriaceae are characterized by superﬁcial, ﬂattened,
dimidiate ascomata with cells of the upper wall that radiate and open by an
ostiole. Asci are bitunicate and ﬁssitunicate and ascospores are hyaline to brown
(Hawksworth et al. 1995, Kirk et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Tothia is a poorly known monotypic genus forming thyriothecia currently
classiﬁed in the Microthyriaceae (Lumbsch & Huhndorf 2010). To reassess the
morphology of T. fuscella, we examined its holotype and re-collected the species

[@204 ... Wu & al.#Page-header*]
from stalks of Teucrium chamaedrys in two diﬀerent regions of Austria. Cultures
of these fresh collections were prepared to extract DNA and to sequence LSU
and ITS rDNA in order to establish the phylogenetic position of this fungus. In
this paper, we provide a detailed description and illustrations of T. fuscella and
establish its familial placement through nuLSU rDNA sequence analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Type material of Tothia fuscella was borrowed from URM. Ascomata were rehydrated
in 3% KOH prior to examination and sectioning. Specimens were examined under
a Leica MZ16A stereomicroscope, and ﬁne forceps were used to remove one or two
ascomata, which were mounted in water, Melzer’s, Congo red, or cotton blue reagents.
Observations and photographs were made under a Nikon E800 or Nikon 80i light
microscope. For some hyaline structures diﬀerential interference contrast microscopy
was used. Sections were cut by hand with a sharp razor blade or into 8-μm thick slices
using a Leica CM1100 freezing microtome and then were transferred to a drop of water
or cotton blue for examination and photography. Measurement ranges cover a minimum
of 30 ascospores, 25 asci, or 10 ascomata. Microtome sections were made from one or
two ascomata, and ten measurements were made from whole ascoma and peridia.
Fresh specimens were collected in Austria and herbarium material is deposited in
IFRD and WU. Single ascospore isolates were obtained following Choi et al. (1999) and
grown on 2% malt extract agar (MEA). Cultures are deposited at the CBS.
Total DNA was extracted from liquid cultures according to Voglmayr & Jaklitsch
(2011). A ca. 1600 bp fragment containing partial SSU, ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 and partial
LSU rDNA was ampliﬁed with primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998)
and LR5 (Vilgalys & Hester 1990). PCR products were puriﬁed by an enzymatic PCR
cleanup as described in Voglmayr & Jaklitsch (2008). DNA was cycle-sequenced using
the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v. 3.1
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington) with primers V9G, LR3 (Vilgalys & Hester 1990) and
LR5, and an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 377 or 3130xl Genetic Analyzer, Applied
Biosystems). The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences obtained in the present
study are listed in Table 1.
One Tothia fuscella sequence was aligned with 12 sequences downloaded from
GenBank (Table 1). Preliminary multiple alignments were generated using BioEdit
(Hall 1999) and ClustalX v. 1.83 (Thompson et al. 1997) and then checked visually and
manually optimized.
The alignment was analyzed using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord 2002) and MrBayes v.
3.0b4 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Schismatomma decolorans (Arthoniomycetes),
which is basal to other ascomycetes in a recent study (Schoch et al. 2009), was selected
as outgroup.
A Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree was inferred with PAUP* using the heuristic search
option with 10000 random taxa addition and tree bisection and reconnection (TBR) as
the branch-swapping algorithm. All characters were unordered and of equal weight;
gaps were treated as missing data. Maxtrees were unlimited, zero-length branches were
collapsed, and all most parsimonious trees were saved. Maximum parsimony bootstrap

analyses were done with the same settings, with ten rounds of random sequence addition
(Hillis & Bull 1993).
The consistency index (CI; Kluge & Farris 1969), retention index (RI; Farris 1989),
and rescaled consistency index (RC; Farris 1989) were obtained from PAUP*.
For Bayesian analyses, evolution was estimated by using MrModeltest 2.2 (Nylander
2004). Posterior probabilities (Rannala & Yang 1996, Zhaxybayeva & Gogarten 2002)
were determined by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC) in MrBayes v.
3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for
1 million generations; trees were sampled every 100th generation, resulting in 10 001
saved trees.

[@206 ... Wu & al.#Page-header*]
The ﬁrst 2000 trees were discarded and the remaining 8001 trees were used for
calculating posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Cai et al. 2006,
2008, Liu et al. 2010). The phylogenetic tree was visualized with TREE-VIEW (Page
1996).#Materials-methods*]

[@Because the ssu-its-lsu rDNA sequences obtained for the two Tothia
fuscella isolates are identical, only one (1535 bp) was included in the analyses.
Of the 735 nucleotides analyzed, 478 were constant and 182 variable characters
were parsimony informative. Maximum parsimony analysis produced a single

[@Comments—In this paper we redescribe the type of Tothia fuscella and
designate an epitype with dried material and an associated living ex-type culture.
Ascomata of T. fuscella are morphologically indistinguishable from typical
representatives of Microthyriaceae. Its ascospores resemble Microthyrium in
being one-septate, guttulate, and slightly asymmetrical but diﬀer in their dilute
brown color. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that T. fuscella is most closely
related to the Venturiaceae, to which it should be assigned.

[@Tothia fuscella, epitypiﬁed ... 209#Page-header*]

Thyriothecial ascomata are unusual for the Venturiaceae, which illustrates
that this ascoma type has evolved independently several times within
Dothideomycetes. Genera in Venturiaceae usually have yellowish, greenish
brown to brown, one-septate ascospores and obclavate asci (Barr 1968, 1989),
which agrees well with Tothia.#Comments*]
