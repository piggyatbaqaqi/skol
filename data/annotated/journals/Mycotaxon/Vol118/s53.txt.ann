[@Three totally diﬀerent books are reviewed here: a beautifully illustrated
French book on myxomycetes, an Indian book on the smut fungi of the
subcontinent, and a well-written, popular-science introduction to mushroom
forming fungi, succinctly titled ‘Mushroom.’#Misc-exposition*]

non delineati,’ a very nicely illustrated book on tropical fungi in China, and a
checklist for all fungi and myxomycetes of Rhode Island (U.S.A.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As anyone who has ever studied myxomycetes knows, the monograph by Martin
and Alexopoulos, published by the University of Iowa Press in 1969, represents
the single most deﬁnitive treatment of this group of organisms published to date.
This monograph (The Myxomycetes) has long since been out of print, but it
still remains—more than 40 years after it ﬁrst appeared—the standard against
which any of the more recently published works on the myxomycetes are judged.
The two volumes that make up Les Myxomycètes undoubtedly represent the
most noteworthy recent contribution to the study of myxomycetes. Although
not totally comprehensive, since some species (particularly tropical examples)
are not included, this work covers virtually any species one is likely to encounter

during a lifetime of collecting. Information is provided on 853 taxa (species
and varieties), and 530 of these are illustrated with color images. These images
represent the most important feature of the work itself. Never before have so
many high-quality (often stunning) macroscopic color images been provided
for so many diﬀerent myxomycetes. For anyone studying myxomycetes, this
alone is reason enough to obtain a copy of Les Myxomycètes. The ﬁrst of the
two volumes begins with a short introduction to the biology, ecology and
morphology of myxomycetes. Since the primary language used throughout the
work is French, this information is not readily available to everyone. However,
the remainder of the ﬁrst volume is devoted to keys and short descriptions
of the species being considered, and this material is presented in both French
and English, which is a major plus for those of us whose knowledge of the
former language is limited. The descriptions include both macroscopic as well
as microscopic characters, and reference is made to the number of the image
provided for a particular species in the second volume. The ﬁrst volume also
contains a glossary of terms, an index to all of the taxa being considered and a
list of relevant bibliographical references. The nomenclature used throughout
both volumes is that found in the current version of Nomenmyx (www.nomen.
eumycetozoa.com), which is generally followed by most of us who work with
myxomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The second volume contains the color images of the 530 taxa. The general
approach used throughout is to have each page devoted to a single image that
shows the habit of the species in question, but some pages contain several
images of the same species. Also included are line drawings that show various
microscopic structures (e.g., spores, capillitium and peridium) that are relevant
to that species. Altogether, the images, drawings and descriptions provide
enough information to allow most specimens of myxomycetes to be identiﬁed
with a high degree of certainty. Since the authors are especially well known
for their studies of nivicolous (“snowbank”) myxomycetes, there is extensive
coverage of this group. In fact, information on some of the nivicolous taxa
they have included in this work was available previously only in the primary
literature. The majority of the color images are truly outstanding, and the only
complaint that anyone might have is that in a few instances (e.g., Physarum
pusillum) the specimen photographed might not have been absolutely typical
for a given species. I found the images of the various species of Licea particularly
well done and thus potentially very useful when working with members of this
genus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Overall, Les Myxomycètes is an extraordinary work that is the result of an
enormous amount of time and eﬀort on the part of the three authors. Simply
looking through the color images in the second volume is enjoyable, but
the complementary information provided in the ﬁrst volume makes this an

exceedingly useful scientiﬁc work on the myxomycetes. Anyone with even the
slightest interest in this group of organisms should have a copy of this work.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The economically important smut fungi of crop plants and the smut fungi
of native plants are treated in this book. It gives descriptions of 343 species in
45 genera, several of them new for science (e.g., three new Sorosporium species
and two new Sphacelotheca species), the genera and species per genus are
treated in alphabetical order. The genus Sporisorium is the largest, represented
by 96 species, followed by Tilletia with 46, and Ustilago with 42.
Besides an introduction to smut fungi and coverage of their economic
importance, diversity, and morphological variations, a useful host index is
provided.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The author, who has spent 2 decades studying smut fungi and especially
their germination patterns, places a strong emphasis on morphotaxonomy and
symptomatology, and although in many cases descriptions are literally the same
as in Vánky (2007), morphological characters have been added to the keys. The
illustrations entail eight colour plates and over 50 drawings of infected plants,
spores, and germinating spores.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The book makes the impression of having been written at the same time as
Vánky’s treatment of the smut fungi of the Indian subcontinent was published,
although that publication is lacking from the list of references. There are no
post-2007 publications cited, not even the phylogenetic paper by Begerow et
al. (2007). The illustrations in Vánky’s 2007 work are of higher quality than the
ones in the present book, but I doubt whether the former is easily available in
India, where it should be used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In eight chapters the reader is given a dazzling, fast-spaced and thorough
introduction into the development of mushrooms (including life cycles), spore
launching, diversity in shape and function, edible mushrooms and conservation,
mushroom cultivation, toxicity, intoxication, and the medicinal mushroom
industry. The text moves back and forth between the author’s experiences in
the England of his youth and present-day life, science, and economics and
yet is always anchored safely in the writings and illustrations of the scientists
of the past. Central to all is the biology of the mushroom, as masterpiece of
bioengineering. It is by no means a text book or ﬁeld guide. Nonetheless,
Mushroom gives a huge amount of information in its 200 pages, makes for
excellent reading, and would be a good present to friends, family, and all who
are intrigued by nature.#Misc-exposition*]
