[@Abstract — Marasmius tyrius is proposed as a new species. It is characterized by collariate
lamellae, insititious stipe, violet pileus, pileipellis with Siccus-type broom cells, and clavate to
fusoid spores. Detailed description and illustrations of macro- and microscopic characters
are provided.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The genus Marasmius (Marasmiaceae, Agaricales) is represented by a large
number of species, especially in the tropics (Singer 1976, 1986). It is characterized
by a hymeniform pileipellis composed of broom cells of Siccus- or Rotalistype, or of exclusively smooth cells. Siccus-type cells are characterized by apical
appendages or more or less erect setulae, while the Rotalis-type usually have
short appendages and that descend from the apex down towards the middle of
the cell (Singer 1986).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Spegazzini (1880a,b, 1883, 1887, 1891, 1898, 1902, 1909, 1925, 1926a,b),
Singer (1950, 1959, 1965, 1969, 1976, 1989), and Singer & Digilio (1953)
described species of Marasmius from Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay. Singer
(1953) later studied several types of species described by Spegazzini and
included his observations in the exhaustive monographs on Marasmius in
South America and Neotropics (Singer 1959, 1965, 1976). After these reports,
mycological literature on the genus in the region has been scant. Recently, there
has been a renewed worldwide interest in Marasmius (Desjardin et al. 2000,
Antonín 2003, 2004a,b, 2007, Wannathes et al. 2004, 2009, Antonín & Buyck
2006, Desjardin & Ovrebo 2006, Puccinelli & Capelari 2006, Tan et al. 2009,
Antonín & Noordeloos 2010). In Argentina, Lechner et al. (2006) reported new
records of Marasmius collected in the northern region, and several species have

[@252 ... Lechner & Papinutti#Page-header*]
been described and illustrated in the Pictorial Atlas of Iguazú National Park
(Wright et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@According to our knowledge, one specimen collected during an expedition
in northern Argentina does not match any described Marasmius. Thus, we
propose Marasmius tyrius as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
The specimen was photographed and its macroscopic features were recorded when
fresh. Tissues were mounted in 5% KOH + 1% aqueous phloxine or Melzer’s reagent and
observed under a Nikon E-600 microscope. For basidiospore measurements, the length
: width quotient (Q) was calculated, with Qm indicating the mean value of Q quotients.
Line drawings were made with the aid of a light tube. Basidiomata were dried, kept
frozen for a week, and deposited in the BAFC herbarium (Department of Biodiversity
and Experimental Biology, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences, Universidad de
Buenos Aires).#Materials-methods*]

marasmioid fungi, Singer (1976) did not present any violet-colored species
with the characteristics of the subsect. Sicciformes, but several purple colored
ones. We will mention the three most similar species. Marasmius marthae
Singer has a purple-red pileus, black stipe at maturity, somewhat longer spores,
and grows on wood pieces; M. rubromarginatus Dennis has a carmine-purple
to brown-red pileus, more distant lamellae (11–15), and longer spores; and M.
sanguirotalis Singer has a dark purple pileus, distant lamellae (11–13), much
longer spores, and grows on branches and woody matter. Among the few other
purple or purple tinged species not treated by Singer (1976), the most similar
is M. purpureobrunneolus Henn. from Indonesia. It diﬀers by reddish-brown to
purplish-brown pileus and more distant lamellae (9–14).
The only two violaceous species in subsect. Sicciformes were described by
Singer (1989) from Brazil, both with signiﬁcantly smaller spores: M. iodactylus
Singer (spores 6–7.5 × 2.5–3.3 µm) and M. izonetae Singer (spores 5 × 2.2 µm).

[@Marasmius tyrius sp. nov. (Argentina) ... 255#Page-header*]

In sect. Marasmius, subsect. Marasmius (= Pararotulae Singer), Singer (1976)
described M. violeorotalis Singer with a violet-lilac pileus. It has the same
habitat as M. tyrius (on leaves of dicotyledonous trees) but diﬀers in smaller
spores (6.2–9.5 × 2.5–3 µm), Rotalis-type broom cells in the pileipellis, and
more distant lamellae (ca. 12). Other Marasmius species with violaceous or
violaceous tinged pileus belong to other sections of the genus.#Comments*]
