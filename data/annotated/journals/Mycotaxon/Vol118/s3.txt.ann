[@Abstract — Species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are usually identiﬁed by
the morphological characteristics of their spores. However, considering the diﬃculties in
diagnosing their taxa, the construction of species-speciﬁc primers has been proposed as an
identiﬁcation alternative. In this paper the problem of distinguishing diﬀerent Gigaspora
species with slight morphological diﬀerences was solved using species-speciﬁc primers and
SSU and LSU rDNA sequence analyses of 18 AM fungal isolates comprising seven species.
Neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood analyses were performed
to evaluate the phylogenetic aﬃliation of the isolates, and a new reverse PCR primer (ALB1)
speciﬁc for Gigaspora albida was designed and tested with 11 Gigaspora isolates (four species).
The results conﬁrmed misidentiﬁcation of ‘G. albida’ FL 927 and ‘G. margarita’ BR 444 and
supported referring FL 927 to G. rosea and BR 444 to G. albida.

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@There are approximately 220 species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
(AMF) (Stockinger et al. 2010). Morphological diﬀerences in spore structure
are usually used to distinguish between individual species, but this requires
a great deal of experience (Morton 1993, Bentivenga & Morton 1994). More
practical methods are needed, so that AMF can be identiﬁed directly not
only in the rhizosphere, but also after host root colonization. DNA analytical
methods involving electrophoretic proﬁles (Wyss & Bonfante 1993), sequence
comparisons (Daniell et al. 2001, Husband et al. 2002, Mummey & Rillig 2007,
Stukenbrock & Rosendahl 2005), PCR-DGGE (Souza et al. 2004), species-

speciﬁc primers (Gamper & Leuchtmann 2007, Geue & Hock 2004, Lanfranco
et al. 1995, 1999, 2001, Millner et al. 1998, 2001a, 2001b, Redecker 2000), and
DNA barcodes (Stockinger et al. 2010) are being developed that would allow
identiﬁcation of individual AMF species in an ecological context. For example,
species-speciﬁc PCR primers could be used to discriminate morphologically
similar species or even to identify species within colonized roots. However, to
date only a small number of species-speciﬁc probes has been developed.
After Oehl et al. (2008) divided the Gigasporaceae into four families and
six genera, Morton & Msiska (2010) proposed dividing Gigasporaceae into just
three genera —Gigaspora, Racocetra, Scutellospora. Gigaspora has ﬁve species
(Bentivenga & Morton 1995) in which the morphological variation is low
(Bago et al. 1998, Souza et al. 2004, Lanfranco et al. 2001), and only diameter,
color and spore wall thickness of glomerospores have been used for species
identiﬁcation (Bentivenga & Morton 1995). Species-speciﬁc primers designed
for G. margarita (Lanfranco et al. 1999) and G. rosea (Lanfranco et al. 2001)
have shown to be eﬀective in solving such morphological conﬂicts. In this study
we show how a species-speciﬁc PCR primer constructed for G. albida helps
solve problems associated with discriminating Gigaspora species and evaluate
Gigaspora phylogenetically through SSU and LSU rDNA analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
AM fungi

Eleven reference isolates (Table 1) representing Gigaspora propagated in pot cultures
were selected.
[@Intracellular bacteria#Section-header*]

Presence of intracellular bacteria was assessed with the Live/Dead Bac-Light
bacterial viability kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) following Bianciotto
et al. (1996).
[@DNA extraction#Section-header*]

Ten to 50 spores were washed in distilled water, sonicated 3–4 times, crushed in
50–100 µl of 1x REDTaq PCR Reaction Buﬀer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.1
mM MgCl2 and 0.01% gelatin) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), and centrifuged at 1000
RPM for 2 min. The supernatant containing the DNA was incubated at 95°C for 13 min.
After extraction, the DNA was stored at –20°C.
Design of PCR primers, ampliﬁcation and sequencing

A new species-speciﬁc reverse PCR primer ALB1 (5’-cccaactaaaaatacttcagtc3’) was designed for G. albida based on the GenBank ITS sequence AJ239118 and
combined with GiITS1 (Lanfranco et al. 1999) to create a 385 bp fragment. For
G. margarita and G. rosea, combinations of primers GiITS1+GiITS2 (Lanfranco et al.
1999) and GiITS1-GiR3 (Lanfranco et al. 2001) were used, respectively.

[@The 28G1 and 28G2 primers (Silva et al. 2006) were used to amplify the partial LSU
rDNA region. NS1, NS2, NS3, NS4, NS5 and NS8 were used to obtain the SSU rDNA
amplicons (White et al. 1990).
PCR reactions were carried out in a volume of 50 µl, containing 10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 200 µM each dNTPs, 1 µM of each

Italy). Cycling parameters were 45 s at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C for 40 cycles,
with a ﬁnal elongation of 7 min at 72°C followed the last cycle. The amplicons were
visualized on 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide. The ampliﬁed products for
SSU and LSU rDNA were puriﬁed with a QIAquick kit (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy)
following the manufacturer’s instruction and sequenced (accession numbers are listed
in Table 1). Sequencing was made by GeneLab (Roma, Italy).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological observations of isolates FL 927 and BR 444#Section-header*]

[@Isolates FL 927 (‘G. albida’) and BR 444 (‘G. margarita’) had morphological
characters similar to other Gigaspora species: spore wall thickness [9.6–(12.2)–
14.4 µm and 12–(13.9)–16.8 µm, respectively] and spore diameter [230–(282)–
360 µm and 250–(320)–384 µm, respectively]. However, the ‘G. margarita’
BR 444 spores were hyaline/white to yellow and lacked the characteristic green
(G. albida) or pink (G. rosea) coloration observed in reference isolates G. albida
BR 601 and G. rosea UT 102. All isolates of ‘G. margarita’ BR 444 and G. albida
BR 601 contained endobacteria, which were absent in all isolates of G. rosea
and ‘G. albida’ FL 927.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Testing species-speciﬁc primers for taxa of Gigaspora#Section-header*]

[@Eleven Gigaspora isolates were screened for PCR ampliﬁcation of a short
partial nuclear ITS rDNA fragment (385bp) with species-speciﬁc primers
(Table 1). The primers GiITS1+GiITS2 ampliﬁed only the G. margarita species,
excluding isolate ‘G. margarita’ BR 444, which did not amplify at all (Fig. 1A).
The combination of the species-speciﬁc primer constructed for G. rosea (GiR3)
with GiITS1 ampliﬁed not only the isolates of G. rosea, but also ‘G. albida’
FL 927 and showed a slight reaction to the DNA from spores of G. albida BR
601 and ‘G. margarita’ BR 444 (Fig. 1B), while the GiITS1+ALB1 primer pair
ampliﬁed only G. albida BR 601 and ‘G. margarita’ BR 444 (Fig. 1C). These
results support a misidentiﬁcation for ‘G. albida’ FL 927 and ‘G. margarita’
BR 444.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analysis of Gigaspora from SSU and LSU rDNA#Section-header*]

[@In the SSU rDNA phylogenetic analyses (NJ, MP and ML), the genus
Gigaspora was supported as a monophyletic group with 100% of the bootstrap
value (Fig. 2). Three subclades were observed in the genus, the ﬁrst grouping
‘G. margarita’ BR 444 with all isolates of G. albida and G. rosea. In the
second cluster just G. gigantea was present and in the last group all isolates of
G. margarita (except ‘G. margarita’ BR 444) appeared together with G. decipiens.

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Due to the low morphological variation amongst Gigaspora species
(Bentivenga & Morton 1995), some papers have reported species misidentiﬁcation (Bago et al. 1998, Souza et al. 2004, Lanfranco et al. 2001). These
studies also report the usefulness of molecular approach as an identiﬁcation
tool. Based on sequences of SSU rDNA and isozyme analysis, Bago et al. (1998)
divided Gigaspora into three subgeneric groups: the ﬁrst with G. margarita and
G. decipiens, the second with G. albida and G. rosea, and the third with G. gigantea.
In this paper these same groups were observed in the phylogeny generated by

LSU rDNA tree, the isolate BR 444 also grouped together with G. albida BR
601, whereas the isolate FL 927 (identiﬁed as G. albida) was clustered with
G. rosea. Bago et al. (1998) observed that the isolates BR 444, identiﬁed initially
as G. margarita, and FL 927 (described as G. albida), should instead be ascribed
to G. albida and G. rosea, respectively. The PCR ampliﬁcation tests with speciesspeciﬁc primers in this study also indicated that these two isolates should be
reclassiﬁed as G. albida and G. rosea. Nevertheless recently Msiska & Morton

group with G. albida or G. rosea, but with G. decipiens.
Using PCR-DGGE analysis, Souza et al. (2004) already observed, as we
conﬁrmed here, that the FL 927 isolate, originally identiﬁed as G. albida, should
be ascribed to G. rosea, indicating identiﬁcation problems. Endobacteria are
usually observed in glomerospores of Gigaspora species, with the exception of

G. rosea isolates. Bacteria were not found in ‘Gigaspora albida’ FL 927, further
substantiating the need for reclassiﬁcation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Van Tuinen et al. (1998) were the ﬁrst to design speciﬁc primers for Gigaspora
species (G. rosea) that amplify a region of the LSU rDNA. Because these
authors tested cross-ampliﬁcation only with species of other AMF genera, it is
not possible to establish whether the primers amplify other Gigaspora species.
Currently there are primers speciﬁc for two Gigaspora species (G. margarita
and G. rosea); nevertheless, we report that the reverse primer GiR3 (Lanfranco
et al. 2001) also ampliﬁes G. albida isolates. As Lanfranco et al. (2001) did not
use G. albida and G. decipiens in their analyses with species-speciﬁc primers,
it was not possible to establish how speciﬁc the primers are to G. rosea and
G. margarita. Of the ﬁve known Gigaspora species (Bentivenga & Morton
1995), only G. decipiens was not used in this work.#Misc-exposition*]
