[@Abstract — Populations of Tremelloscypha gelatinosa were found growing on the soil in
Gymnopodium ﬂoribundum associations of the tropical deciduous forest in southern Mexico
(State of Chiapas). Documentation of the diﬀerent developmental coriaceous and spongy
stages revealed a widely variable gross morphology that ranges from stipeless pulvinate forms
to rudimentarily stipitate pseudoinfundibuliform forms that appear polyporoid, steroid, or
gomphoid. The studied collections are described and their taxonomically distinctive macroand micromorphological characters are illustrated. The possible mycorrhizal association of
T. gelatinosa with Gymnopodium ﬂoribundum and traditional use of the basidiomes as a wild
edible fungus by the local population are also discussed.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@During the last few years we have sampled ectomycorrhizal macromycetes
within the Gymnopodium ﬂoribundum Rolfe (Polygonaceae) association, a type
of tropical deciduous vegetation established in the Central Chiapas basin (State
of Chiapas) in southern Mexico [Miranda 1952, as G. antigonoides; ReyesGarcía & Souza 1997]. Several species of Amanita, Cantharellus, Russula and
other ectomycorrhizal genera have been found, all possibly associating with
G. ﬂoribundum. Lactarius chiapanensis Montoya et al. was previously recorded
from this ecosystem (Montoya et al. 1996) and recently several new fresh
collections were gathered.#Misc-exposition*]
[@An interesting ﬁnd in the Gymnopodium forest was numerous specimens
of a fungus with coriaceous soft spongy rudimentarily stipitate sporophores.
Mature specimens, which were somewhat trumpet-shaped, resembled a
stout Gomphus species. After examination, we identiﬁed these specimens as

[@148 ... Bandala, Montoya & Villegas#Page-header*]
Tremelloscypha gelatinosa, a heterobasidiomycete related to members of order
Sebacinales M. Weiß et al. (Weiß et al. 2004a). Molecular-based studies indicate
that T. gelatinosa belongs to Sebacinales group A and is phylogenetically
related to proven ectomycorrhizal species (Weiß & Oberwinkler 2001, Weiß
et al. 2004a, Selosse et al. 2002). There is still no documentation about the
mycorrhizas of T. gelatinosa, but its phylogenetic placement among recognized
ectomycorrhizal sebacinoid species suggests that it could be a potential fungal
symbiont of plant roots (Glen et al. 2002, Selosse et al. 2002, Urban et al. 2003,
Weiß et al. 2004a,b). Considering the abundance of T. gelatinosa and its possible
ectomycorrhizal status in the Gymnopodium forest that we visited, we collected
mycorrhizas from soil samples, including some occurring directly under
T. gelatinosa sporophores. Morphological examination revealed the constant
presence of at least two diﬀerent morphotypes, but as PCR ampliﬁcation from
extracted genomic DNA failed, it was not possible to determine whether the
collected mycorrhizas involved T. gelatinosa or other fungi. New collections
of root tips of Gymnopodium ﬂoribundum–Tremelloscypha gelatinosa will be
studied in the future.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Tremelloscypha gelatinosa is rare not only in Mexico but also worldwide,
and its morphological variation still deserves to be documented and illustrated.
Therefore we present important information on the extent of morphological
variation exhibited by fresh basidiomes collected at diﬀerent developmental
stages. Today the species concept of T. gelatinosa is based on the type specimen
(a portion of a basidiome) and some single collections from Jamaica (type
locality), Florida (USA), Yucatan and Quintana Roo (Mexico) (Burt 1915,
Guzmán 2004, Roberts 2006, Wells 1961, Wells & Oberwinkler 1982). Here we
describe our new collections in detail, providing photographs and illustrations
of basidiomes and distinctive micromorphological characters and taxonomic
observations.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Tremelloscypha gelatinosa is an economically valuable wild edible fungus
in the Central Chiapas basin, particularly near Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas.
In this region T. gelatinosa is locally known as “nangañaña” and —with the
so-called “moni” Lactarius chiapanensis (ﬁrst reported by Miranda 1952 and
formally described by Montoya et al.. 1996)— is commonly collected by the
local population for personal consumption and/or for sale. Gymnopodium
ﬂoribundum is a dominant or co-dominant species in the deciduous tropical
forest established at SE of Tuxtla Gutierrez (Miranda 1952, Reyes-García &
Souza 1997); the G. ﬂoribundum forest, which (although now fragmented) covers
several hectares, is collectively called “nangañal” (“aguanal” or “aguanacatonal”
in Miranda 1952). More will be published on traditional use of T. gelatinosa in
the future.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
Observations were made from fresh basidiomes collected in a forest dominated by
Gymnopodium ﬂoribundum, a tropical deciduous component of vegetation in Suchiapa,
municipality of Suchiapa, SE of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas. Color codes in descriptions
refer to Kornerup & Wanscher (1967; e.g. 10C2) and Munsell (1994; e.g. 5YR 4/1). For
microscopic observations, hand sections of dried samples were mounted in 3% KOH
and stained with both 1% Congo red aqueous solution and phloxine. Line drawings were
made with the aid of a drawing tube. Measurements were made in KOH; 35–45 spores
were measured per collection; Xr = range of means of length × width of n collections;
Qr = range of means of basidiospore length/width ratios in n collections. Herbarium
acronyms follow Holmgren et al. (1990).
Identiﬁcation of collection VB4212 was conﬁrmed by extraction and ampliﬁcation
of the ITS rDNA region according to Montoya et al. (2010). The obtained sequence was
edited with Sequencher Ver. 4.1 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Michigan) and deposited
in GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) under accession number
T. gelatinosa (VB 4212) JQ012947. The ITS rDNA sequence from VB4212 was compared
with T. gelatinosa AF490394 (GenBank) using the BLAST sequence similarity search
tool (Altschul et al. 1997), revealing a 99% maximum similarity.#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion

Recognition of Tremelloscypha gelatinosa as a non-resupinate fungus (i.e.
diﬀerent from members of Eichleriella Bres.; cf. Wells & Raitviir 1980) was
inferred not from the type but from a specimen from Florida gathered by K.
Lampe & A.L. Welden in 1957 (Wells 1961). The holotype (from Jamaica) in fact
consists of only a pressed 35 × 18 mm portion apparently separated from the rest
of the basidiome and superﬁcially bearing a resemblance to an eﬀuse-reﬂexed
fructiﬁcation as indicated both by the diagnosis (Burt 1915) and the ﬁeld label
accompanying the type noting “a specimen of Stereum or Cladoderris.” Using
data from the previously cited Florida collection and microscopic examination
of the holotype, Wells & Oberwinkler (1982) recorded T. gelatinosa as growing
on decayed wood and described the basidiomes as 35–75 × 20–55 mm, 1–6
mm thick, ﬂabellate, infundibuliform or pseudoinfundibuliform in shape, and
with a poorly deﬁned stipe.
Our fresh collections covered many diﬀerent developmental stages, thus
providing more information on the variability of the gross morphology.
The fructiﬁcations were irregularly subglobose, pulvinate, lacking a stipe or
rudimentarily stipitate and pseudoinfundibuliform, more or less trumpetshaped and sometimes ﬂabellate or spathulate, not with umbilicate, depressed
or deeply depressed pileus, in some stages the sporophores then superﬁcially
resembled polyporoid, stipitate-steroid or gomphoid forms.
Sporophores of both T. australiensis D.A. Reid, the type species of the
genus (Reid 1979), and our T. gelatinosa collections grew on soil, not wood.
Tremelloscypha australiensis diﬀers morphologically from T. gelatinosa in its
smaller (7–20 × 8–12 mm) distinctly infundibuliform stipitate basidiomes that
are yellow when fresh and yellowish- or ochraceous-brown when dry and a
pileus surface with an almost waxy-cartilaginous appearance (Reid 1979).
Spore characters are particularly important: T. australiensis basidiospores
are subcylindrical, narrowly elliptical to suballantoid (Reid 1982: 10–13.2 ×
4.5–5 µm; Wells & Oberwinkler 1982: 10.5–13 × 5–5.5 µm), while T. gelatinosa
basidiospores are ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid (Burt 1915: 8–10 × 6 µm;
Wells 1961: 7.5–11 × 5.5–8 µm; Wells & Oberwinkler 1982: 9–13.5(–14.5) ×
5.5–8(–9.5) µm; Guzmán 2004: (7–)9–13 × 6–8 µm; this study: 8–13 × (5.5–)
6–9 µm).#Comments*]
