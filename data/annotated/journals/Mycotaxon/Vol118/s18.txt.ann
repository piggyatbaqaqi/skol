[@Abstract — Fifteen new records of polypore species are reported from the southern Florida,
USA, with short comments to their key features, ecology, and distribution. The combination
Fomitiporia apiahyna is proposed.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The southernmost part of Florida south of Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41, which
bisects Miami) lies in the tropical hardwood forest region of the state (Young
& Giese 2003). This relatively small area contributes substantially to poroid
xylophilous fungi diversity in the USA, and about 15% of USA polypore species
published in a compendium by Gilbertson & Ryvarden (1986, 1987) probably are
found only here. Although Ryvarden (2004) and Decock et al. (2007) published
new data on southern Florida Ganodermataceae and Hymenochaetaceae, to our
knowledge no new records have been added for the Polyporaceae since 1987.
Most of the territory belongs to Everglades National Park and is covered
with regularly ﬂooded wetland or with extensive mangrove stands along the
coast. The rather uniform mangrove polypore ﬂora from Brazil treated by
Sotão et al. (2002) and Trierveiler-Pereira et al. (2009) is not the primary focus
of our study.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Much higher polypore diversity is found in tropical hardwood forest areas
with red-barked gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. (Burseraceae)) the
typical tree species. This forest-type, however, is conﬁned to small tear-shaped

[@160 ... Vlasák& al.#Page-header*]
islands of “hardwood hammocks” that occur on raised peaty platforms above
surrounding wetlands. As most are inaccessible by foot, the casual visitor is
restricted to only a handful of such localities in the Everglades and several Miami
city parks. Another distinctive Everglades locality comprises the remnant pine
rockland fragments dominated by Pinus elliottii Engelm. (Pinaceae).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Several small state parks were also established in the Florida Keys archipelago.
Their polypore ﬂora is not as rich because many temperate tree species, such as
southern live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill. (Fagaceae)) and sugarberry (Celtis
laevigata Willd. (Ulmaceae)), together with their associated polypores reach
their southern limits on the mainland. Also, Florida Keys hardwood hammocks
are drier because of ocean breezes and low rainfall (Whitney et al. 2004). On
the other hand, there are several tropical trees that occur only in the Keys and
some polypore species seem to be growing only on them.#Misc-exposition*]
[@After exploring all these small localities several times, we have discovered
some tropical polypores not yet recorded from the USA. We describe these
below and also propose one new combination. Critical Florida collections were
compared with our ﬁnds of the same or similar species from northern Florida,
US Virgin Islands, Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. Some species could be
determined only after ITS rRNA region sequencing. Surprisingly, sequencing
conﬁrmed some of the most common polypores as new records.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
During December 2003, April 2009, August 2010, and December 2010, polypore
specimens were photographed in situ, collected, dried, and examined microscopically
mounted in Melzer´s reagent or 10% KOH. All specimens were deposited in private
herbarium of the ﬁrst author, with duplicates of some specimens maintained in the
Prague Museum Herbarium (PRM).
DNA was isolated from selected polypore samples and the ITS rRNA region was
sequenced to conﬁrm the determination. 0.25 g of the context tissue from dried
specimens was disintegrated 60 s with a steel ball in mixer mill MM301 RETSCH at
room temperature. DNA was isolated using CTAB/NaCl extraction buﬀer (Murray &
Thompson 1980), followed by repeated extraction with chloroform and isopropanol
precipitation. Crude DNA was dissolved in 100 ml of sterile water and further puriﬁed
using Wizard Clean Up kit PROMEGA. Resulting DNA solution (50 μl) was diluted
ten times and 1 μl was used as template for ampliﬁcation with ITS5 and ITS4 primers
(White et al. 1990) in 25 ml reaction mixture using 55 °C annealing temperature.
Ampliﬁed DNA was sequenced in the Genomics laboratory of Biology Centre, Academy
of Sciences of the Czech Republic, České Budějovice, on ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer,
using BigDye Terminator 3.1 kit.#Materials-methods*]

[@Comments – This species is remarkable for its very small thumbnail-sized
applanate (more often ungulate) pilei. Its microscopic features are reminiscent
of Fomitiporia robusta (P. Karst.) Fiasson & Niemelä: globose thick-walled
strongly dextrinoid spores that are, however, distinctly smaller in Fo. apiahyna
and an absence of setae. As molecular analysis clusters the species with
Fo. robusta/punctata (Góes-Neto et al. 2002), we transfer this species to
Fomitiporia Murrill as deﬁned by Fiasson & Niemelä (1984).#Comments*]

[@Comments – This annual, sometimes reviving, corky hard species is by far
the most common pileate Phellinus in southern Florida. Accordingly, it is
also a very variable species forming usually ﬂat applanate pilei but sometimes
also triquetrous or eﬀused-reﬂexed basidiomes or fully eﬀused (on the log
underside) with detached sharp margin. No cuticle or black line develops
under the pileus tomentum, which is quite persistent, usually structured in
sharp zones (agglutinated in some), exuding a thin waxy layer that is somewhat
shiny-glossy and silvery. This important ﬁeld trait is, however, not obvious in old
pilei with hardened surfaces. The pore surface is much more constant: fulvous#Misc-exposition*]

[@with a purplish tint and pores that are very small (7–9 per mm), very regular,
round, and with thick dissepiments. Hymenial setae are short (≤ 25 μm), not
much contrasting, abundant in some specimens but very rare and diﬃcult to
ﬁnd in others. In the hymenium are thin-walled, ventricose cystidioles (necks
≤ 10 × 1.5-2 μm) that are not mentioned in descriptions but well pictured in
Loguercio-Leite & Wright (1995). Basidiospores (oblong ellipsoid, hyaline,
thin-walled, 3.5–4.2 × 2.2–2.9 μm) are always collapsed and diﬃcult to ﬁnd in
winter and early spring collections.#Misc-exposition*]
[@This species is evidently a taxonomical problem. The ITS rRNA region
sequence is identical with the GenBank sequence AY558649 from culture
CBS 182.34. In 1934 Overholts isolated the culture in the USA as Phellinus
torulosus (Pers.) Bourdot & Galzin. Tomšovský & Jankovský (2007) showed,
however, that this sequence diﬀers from the European Fuscoporia (Phellinus)
torulosa (Pers.) T. Wagner & M. Fisch. Moreover, Fu. torulosa develops much
thicker basidiomes that are very persistent, even on dead wood for more than
25 years. Fu. torulosa probably does not occur in the USA, for there are no
reliable records (see also Rizzo et al. 2003) and we were not able to ﬁnd it
despite numerous excursions in Pennsylvania and Virginia where it should
have optimal conditions for growth.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phellinus roseocinereus (Murrill) D.A. Reid, described from North America
and widespread in Central America (Lowe 1957), corresponds very well to
this common Florida polypore. However, we agree with Ryvarden & Johansen
(1980) and Loguercio-Leite & Wright (1995), who consider P. roseocinereus#Misc-exposition*]

[@identical to Fu. callimorpha, described originally from Madagascar. Corner
(1991) was unable to detect any diﬀerence between Phellinus senex (Nees &
Mont.) Imazeki from Asia and P. callimorphus, except for slightly narrower
spores of the latter. The sequence of Fuscoporia senex (Nees & Mont.) Ghob.Nejh. in GenBank AY558647 (isolate CBS 442.76 of B.K. Bakshi from India),
which is really much more similar to our sequences than Fu. torulosa, still
clusters separately (with 99% bootstrap support, not shown). Judging from the
literature and our examinations of two Fu. senex specimens from China, we
think that Fu. senex has only an indistinctly zonate pileus surface, lacks glossy
zones, and produces broader spores (>3.5 μm; compared to always <3 μm in
Fu. callimorpha). Also, older Fu. senex spores are sometimes slightly thickwalled and yellowish, never true in Fu. callimorpha.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phellinus neocallimorphus Gibertoni & Ryvarden, known only from the
type locality in Brazil, diﬀers from Fu. callimorpha only by the absence of
setae. Nevertheless, we also could not ﬁnd any setae in some of our specimens
(e.g. 0312/20.5) although in other respects, including rDNA ITS region
sequence, the specimens were typical. More detailed study of P. neocallimorphus
is needed, evidently.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phellinus gilvus (Schwein.) Pat. is another quite similar species found in
southern Florida, although not as often as elsewhere in the USA. The similar
basidiomes are, however, glabrous, without tomentum, azonate, and softer.
Although also hyaline and thin-walled, Ph. gilvus spores are ovoid and 3–3.5
μm broad.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We have sequenced nine collections of Fu. callimorpha from southern
Florida, US Virgin Islands, and Mexico with markedly diﬀerent pileus forms,
and, except for a few mutations, all sequences are the same. We infer that there
is no other similar species in the region.#Comments*]

tough trametoid consistency, and coarsely hirsute pileus. Coriolopsis hostmannii
looks more like a pileate Inonotus species because of its relatively soft context

[@Distribution & ecology – Argentina, Africa (David & Rajchenberg 1992), Panama
(Núñez & Ryvarden 1999). Mostly on hardwoods but the type was collected in Argentina
on Pinus taeda L. (Rajchenberg 1983). In Florida it occurs on logs of slough pine (Pinus
elliottii) in seasonally ﬂooded parts of the Everglades Long Pine Key region. Probably
not rare as we noted several quite disintegrated basidiomes in dry wintertime. During
the next summer the whole area was a half meter under water and we could collect only
one well developed specimen just on the edge of a water basin.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Comments – Dextrinoid to weakly amyloid skeletals that dissolve in KOH
and the tiny spores make this species unmistakable. The species was originally
described as “resupinate or eﬀused-reﬂexed.” Although our collections from
Belize on hardwoods are always pileate, our Florida specimens (collected on
pine) are strictly resupinate. Also, from the microphotography, the spores#Misc-exposition*]

Nevertheless, the ITS rRNA sequences of Belize and Florida samples are nearly
identical. Though originally described as a variety of S. nivea (Rajchenberg
1983), the ITS rRNA sequence shows no signiﬁcant homology with S. nivea
(Jungh.) Jean Keller but low homology with S. chrysella Niemelä (91%) and
