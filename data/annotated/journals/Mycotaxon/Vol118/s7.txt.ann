[@Abstract— A new collection of Lentinus giganteus from Sri Lanka, where it was originally
described, is used to epitypify the species after comparison with the type protologue and
drawings held in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka; a full description and illustrations are provided.
Additional collections were made at three sites in northern Thailand. Phylogenetic ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence analyses using maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony
and Bayesian inference all support the transfer of L. giganteus to Pleurotus. Although the
collections from Thailand diﬀer slightly morphologically and phylogenetically from
P. giganteus sensu stricto, these diﬀerences do not yet merit speciﬁc status. Instead, P. giganteus
is maintained as one widely variable species represented by relatively large fruiting bodies.
Saprobic on buried well-rotted wood in forests, P. giganteus is widely consumed in Sri Lanka
and might be proﬁtably cultivated in Thailand.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Research on macrofungi of the Mushroom Research Centre and surrounding
areas in northern Thailand has documented a remarkable biodiversity and
produced many new species and new records (Le et al. 2007a,b; Sanmee
et al. 2008; Kerekes & Desjardin 2009; Wannathes et al. 2009a,b; Zhao et al.
2010). Recently we have focused on potentially cultivatable and edible genera
(Karunarathna et al. 2011). This paper presents the ﬁrst report of Lentinus
giganteus from Thailand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lentinus Fr. is a cosmopolitan genus with an estimated 40 species (Kirk et al.
2008) distributed across a wide temperature range, being abundant in the tropics
and often found in temperate regions (Pegler 1983). Lentinus species, normally
wood decaying basidiomycetes, are characterized by decurrent lamellae,
dimitic tissues, and hyaline ellipsoid to cylindrical basidiospores. Species in
subgenus Lentinus have hyphal pegs (Corner 1981, Pegler 1983). Generally
the xeromorphic long-lived basidiomes are tough and ﬁrm when dry, but in
Thailand they fruit only at the beginning of the rainy season (Sysouphanthong
et al. 2010, Karunarathna et al. 2011). Traditionally, Lentinus was placed in the
agaric family Tricholomataceae based on the lamellate hymenophore and white
spore print (e.g., Miller 1973).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Previous researchers (e.g., Redhead & Ginns 1985; Hibbett & Vilgalys
1991, 1993; Hibbett & Thorn 1994; Hibbett et al. 1993) noted the existence
of a Lentinus–Pleurotus–Panus complex and showed that Lentinus sensu
Pegler is polyphyletic, with the monophyletic Lentinus subg. Lentinus sensu
Pegler belonging to the Polyporales (Hibbett 1991, Kruger & Gargas 2004).
Panus Fr., Pleurotus (Fr.) P. Kumm., and Neolentinus Redhead & Ginns are
also monophyletic, with Pleurotus belonging to the Agaricales (Fleming 1994,
Hibbett et al. 1994). Corner (1981), Kühner (1980), Pegler (1975, 1983) and
Singer (1986) all classiﬁed these genera diﬀerently.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lentinus giganteus, originally described from Sri Lanka (Berkeley 1847),
bears many structures that are atypical of Lentinus, and its taxonomic position
has long been unresolved (Pegler 1983). Corner (1981: 54) suggested it as type
(and only species) of his new subgenus, Panus subg. Gigantopanus Corner.
Pegler (1983: 168) transferred this subgenus (as a section) to Lentinus: L. sect.
Gigantopanus (Corner) Pegler. Even though the largest spores become oblongellipsoid, mature spores are not cylindrical but somewhat broadly ellipsoid. The
oil guttule present inside the spore is characteristic of Lentinus. The generative
hyphae are narrower than the skeletal hyphae. The lamellar edge is distinct with
a broad, sterile layer of lecythiform cheilocystidia similar to those observed
in some Pleurotus species. The lamellae are wide and well separated, and the
development process is metavelangiocarpic. In many ways this species might
be more properly positioned in Pleurotus, rather than in Lentinus. However,

[@Pleurotus giganteus comb. nov. (Sri Lanka, Thailand) ... 59#Page-header*]

the skeletal hyphae of the dimitic hyphal system dominate to produce a
tough basidiome and the radiate construction of the hymenophoral trama
diﬀerentiates with the descending trama observed in Pleurotus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lentinus giganteus, referred to as “uru paha” in Sri Lanka, is one of the largest
edible mushrooms and —as noted in Buddhist literature— has been treated as
a special food since ancient times (Udugama & Wickramaratna 1991; Berkeley
1847).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Objectives of the present study were to redescribe L. giganteus from fresh
collections from the type locality, epitypify L. giganteus with a fresh Sri Lankan
collection, decide on the taxonomic position of L. giganteus to determine whether
it is related to Lentinus or Pleurotus using ITS-1-5.8 S-ITS2 rDNA sequence
data, and introduce the species to Thailand as a new edible mushroom.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Lentinus giganteus samples were collected in northern Thailand and Sri Lanka
between June 2008 and October 2010 and processed as in Karunarathna et al. (2011).
[@Ethnomycological survey#Section-header*]

[@Thirty locals including mushroom sellers in markets were surveyed through a general
questionnaire in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai provinces, Thailand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphological examination#Section-header*]

Macro-morphological characters were described from fresh material and documented
by photographs. Colour designations (e.g., 4B5) follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1978),
while the colour names (e.g., grayish yellow) follow Ridgway (1912). Specimens were
dried, placed in separate plastic bags, and deposited in the Herbarium of Mae Fah
Luang University (MFLU). For microscopical examination, sections were cut with
a razor blade from dried specimens, mounted on slides in 5% KOH and Congo red,
observed, measured, and illustrated using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 compound microscope.
Basidiospore measurement abbreviations: n = number of spores measured; Lm = mean
spore length; Wm = mean spore width; Q = length/width ratio (L/W) of a spore in side

[@Molecular & phylogenetic methods#Section-header*]

DNA extraction— Genomic DNA was extracted from dried mushroom samples
with cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) according to Doyle & Doyle (1990)
with some modiﬁcations. DNA concentrations were estimated visually in agarose gel by
comparing band intensity with a 1000 bp DNA ladder (Transgen Biotech).
PCR amplification & sequencing—PCR reactions were performed in a 50 μl
volume (0.625 mM primers (White et al. 1990: ITS4: 5´tcctccgcttattgatatgc3´;
ITS5: 5’ggaagtaaaagtcgtaacaagg3´); 10–20 ng DNA template, 10× buﬀer, 0.2 mM
dNTPs, 1.5 units Taq and sterile water. Thermal cycles: 3 m at 94 °C, 30–35 cycles at 93
°C for 30 s, 1 m at 55 °C, 1 m at 72 °C, ﬁnal extension 10 m at 72 °C. PCR products were
veriﬁed by 1% agarose electrophoresis gels stained with ethidium bromide in 1×Trisboric acid EDTA buﬀer. ITS 4/ITS 5 were used to sequence both DNA strands (White et
al. 1990) at the National Botanic Gardens of Belgium.#Materials-methods*]

[@Sequence alignment & phylogenetic analysis—Taxa sequenced and GenBank
accession numbers are listed in Table 1. Sequences for each strain were aligned
using Clustal X (Thompson et al. 1997). Alignments were manually adjusted to allow
maximum sequence similarity. Gaps were treated as missing data. Phylogenetic analysis
were performed using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord 1998). Ambiguously aligned regions
were excluded from all analyses. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option
with TBR branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were
unlimited, branches of zero length were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees
were saved. Clade stability of the trees resulting from the parsimony analyses were
assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates, each with 10 replicates of random
stepwise addition of taxa (Felsenstein 1985). Trees were ﬁgured in TreeView.#Misc-exposition*]

the phylogenetic position of L. giganteus (Plate 1).
The three L. giganteus samples from Thailand (mflu08 1370, mflu08 1371,
mflu10 0141) and Chinese collections from GenBank form one clade (Plate 1)
that is sister (86% bootstrap support) to the only L. giganteus collection from
Sri Lanka. Both Sri Lankan and Thai collections are closely related to Pleurotus
cornucopiae and P. euosmus (89% bootstrap support). The L. giganteus clade,
P. cornucopiae, and P. euosmus cluster with Pleurotus subg. Coremiopleurotus
(100% bootstrap support). Coremiopleurotus comprises P. australis, P. smithii,
P. cystidiosus, and P. fuscosquamulosus.
These results support the view that L. giganteus is related to Pleurotus and not
Panus or Lentinus. Since the morphological data also supports the molecular

[@Discussion— Molecular evidence indicates that Lentinus giganteus is better
placed in Pleurotus. This is supported by morphology as (1) the lamella-edge is
well deﬁned with a broad, sterile layer of diﬀerentiated cheilocystidia, similar
to those found in some Pleurotus species; (2) basidiomes are soft in texture with
short life span, similar to Pleurotus species; (3) the lamellae are broad and well
spaced; and (4) development is metavelangiocarpic. Although Corner (1981)
established L. subg. Gigantopanus for L. giganteus, our limited data do not
support this division.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We collected 11 Pleurotus giganteus specimens from three sites in northern
Thailand and one specimen from the original site in Sri Lanka cited in the
protologue. The new Sri Lankan collection, identical to that of Corner’s (1981)
description and our observation of the holotype, is designated as epitype of
P. giganteus. Molecular data groups our collections from Thailand with high
bootstrap support in a single clade that clusters with sequences of P. giganteus
from China, suggesting strain similarity. The Sri Lankan P. giganteus collection
forms a sister group with Thai and Chinese collections with 86% bootstrap
support. This suggests that the Chinese and Thai collections might have
diverged from the Sri Lankan species due to geographical isolation. There are
also micro-morphological diﬀerences (Table 2), although more collections
are needed to conﬁrm whether these are diﬀerent taxa. Thus we maintain P.
giganteus as a single widely variable species. Both Thai and Sri Lankan collections
are more closely related to Pleurotus than to Panus and Lentinus. Pleurotus
australis, P. smithii, P. cystidiosus, and P. fuscosquamulosus (all Pleurotus subg.

Coremiopleurotus) group with all sequenced P. giganteus collections with 100%
bootstrap support.
Pleurotus giganteus is closely related to P. subg. Coremiopleurotus, a group
of edible species with high commercial value (Zervakis et al. 2004). The
relationship suggests that P. giganteus is likely to be a good edible species,
conﬁrmed by its present consumption in Sri Lanka (Pegler 1983; Udugama &
Wickramaratna 1991). Pleurotus giganteus is also considered edible in China
(Dai et al. 2010).
The most commonly and easily cultivated mushrooms in Thailand and other
southeast Asian countries are oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.)
P. Kumm.), ear mushrooms (Auricularia polytricha (Mont.) Sacc.), and straw
mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea (Bull.) Singer). Other mushroom species in

[@68 ... Karunarathna & al.#Page-header*]
Lentinula, Lentinus, Ganoderma, and Macrocybe (Hanko 2001, Karunarathna
et al. 2011, Boa 2007) and Agrocybe can also be cultivated successfully but
require more attention and knowledge (Boa 2007).
Wild mushrooms are one of the higher valued non-timber forest products
in northern Thailand (Sysouphanthong et al. 2010, Karunarathna et al. 2011).
They provide locals with seasonal food, medicine, and an alternative income
while maintaining forest health (Sysouphanthong et al. 2010). The richness
of wild mushrooms is also one bioindicator of ecosystem health (Dai & Yang
2009; Du et al. 2011a,b; Sysouphanthong et al. 2010; Egli 2010). Cultivated,
non-mycorrhizal mushrooms (e.g., Lentinula edodes (Berk.) Pegler, Pleurotus
sajor-caju (Fr.) Singer, Flammulina velutipes (Curtis) Singer, and species of
Agaricus, Auricularia, Pleurotus, Agrocybe, and Volvariella) are available year
around in northern Thai markets. However, edible wild mushrooms can be
found only in the wet season from June to September (Sysouphanthong et al.
2010, Karunarathna et al. 2011). As Pleurotus species form a heterogeneous
commercially valuable group of edibles, it is therefore desirable to try to introduce
members of this genus as commercial species. Although there are many studies
on cultivated and wild edible mushrooms and their nutritional value in the
northern hemisphere (Aletor 1995; Latiﬀ et al. 1996; Manzi et al. 1999, 2001;
Dermirbas 2000), there is little information available concerning the taxonomy,
biodiversity, and economic potential of Pleurotus species in the tropics. Scientiﬁc
information on wild mushrooms is essential for the introduction of new species
for the table (Karunarathna et al. 2011, Sysouphanthong et al. 2010).
Based on the survey of 30 locals through a questionnaire in Chiang Mai and
Chiang Rai provinces, we were unable to obtain a clear idea as to whether or
not they regard P. giganteus as an edible mushroom. Pleurotus giganteus is not
sold in Thai markets during wet season, and most inhabitants of Chiang Mai
and Chiang Rai provinces do not consume this wild edible mushroom. Even
though P. giganteus has a very good taste (Udugama & Wickramaratna 1991), it
is not yet cultivated in Thailand as a commercial mushroom.#Misc-exposition*]
