[@Abstract — Aschersonia conica, a new anamorphic species of the family Clavicipitaceae,
is described and illustrated based on specimens collected in Hainan Province, China.
The entomogenous fungus is characterized by conical, whitish to pale yellow stromata
that are surrounded by a hypothallus and a wide base, wide ostiolar openings, cylindrical
conidiogenous cells in a compact palisade, ﬁliform sterile elements, and fusiform conidia.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Aschersonia Mont., a large genus in the family Clavicipitaceae, has been well
studied, especially in America and Europe (Hywel-Jones & Evans 1993; Liu et
al. 2005). Recently, new studies on Aschersonia and Hypocrella were carried out
using both morphological and molecular techniques (Liu et al. 2006; Spatafora
et al. 2007; Sung et al. 2007). Chaverri et al. (2008), who have provided the
most extensive revision of Aschersonia since Petch (1921), accepted 32 species.
They showed that Aschersonia is a form genus that shares similar anamorph
morphologies with Moelleriella and Hypocrella but that both teleomorphic
genera can be distinguished by their ascospore disarticulation and conidial
shape and size. Mongkolsamrit et al. (2009) later published three additional
species based on morphology combined with ITS and β-tubulin sequence
analysis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In China, Tzean et al. (1997) and Qiu et al. (2009, 2010) studied Aschersonia
and its teleomorphic forms, Hypocrella Sacc., Moelleriella Bres., and Samuelsia
P. Chaverri & K.T. Hodge. During a recent survey on insect pathogenic
fungi in tropical forests in southern China, a previously unknown species
of entomopathogenic Aschersonia was collected in the Jianfengling National
Nature Reserve and is proposed here as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
Fungal measurements and microscopical observations followed Qiu et al. (2009,
2010). Spore range data exclude 5% of measurements from each end of the range, which
are given in parentheses. Text abbreviations are as follows: CB = Cotton Blue, L = mean
spore length (arithmetic average of all spores), W = mean spore width (arithmetic
average of all spores), Q = variation in the L/W ratios among all specimens studied,
n = number of spores measured from a given number of specimens. Conidiomata
were carefully dissected with a razor blade and mounted in water or lactic acid mixed
with cotton blue on a slide. Special color terms follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1967).
Specimen vouchers are deposited at the Mycological Herbarium, Fujian Agricultural
and Forestry University (MHFAFU).#Materials-methods*]

[@Teleomorph: Unknown.
Stromata—Pyriform, conical-pulvinate, markedly convex, consisting of
dense hyphae, base spreading, forming a pale yellow membranous hypothallus
up to 1.8 mm diam., 0.5 mm high, whitish-coloured when fresh, several ostiolar
openings as large dots visible on the surface.
Pycnidia—Usually single, embedded in the centre of the stroma, CB–,
252–306 µm high, 103–141 µm diam, elongate ﬂask-shaped. Conidiogenous
cells phialidic, cylindrical, up to 15 µm long.
Paraphyses—Present, linear, ﬁliform, ﬂexuous, up to 116 µm long, 0.7 µm

Conidia—Fusoid, sometimes narrowly fusiform, with acute ends, 8.2–10.5

presence of paraphyses and hypothallus. Two previously described species, A.
turbinata Berk. and A. juruensis Henn. (Petch 1921, Chaverri et al. 2008), also
have similarly shaped stromata. However, A. turbinata diﬀers in having ovoid
conidia that are longer and wider (10.5–11.2 × 4.5–5.0 μm), producing copious
slime, and lacking paraphyses. Aschersonia juruensis diﬀers in pulvinate
stromata with sloping sides (convex), more conidiomata per stroma (>20),
longer wider conidia (14.5–15.5 × 3.7–4.0 μm) that are ventricose with acute
ends, and the absence of paraphyses.#Comments*]
