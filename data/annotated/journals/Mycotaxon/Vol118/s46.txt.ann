[@Abstract — Two new Tuber species from China are described and illustrated. Tuber
sinoalbidum is recognized by its white mid to large sized ascocarps and spinulose-reticulate
ascospores, while T. polyspermum is characterized by Tuber lyonii-like ascospores and smaller
brown ascomata. A molecular study based on the ITS sequences supports the erection of the
two new species.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Tuber is a genus of ascomycetous fungi that form ectomycorrhizae with shrubs
and trees. Species of the genus have been extensively studied because many
form edible hypogeous ascocarps — the truﬄes. Some of these are renowned
for their ﬂavor and are commercially important, with the two European species,
T. magnatum Picco and T. melanosporum Vittad., commanding the highest
prices. Other species harvested include T. aestivum Vittad., T. borchii Vittad.,
T. gibbosum Harkn., and T. indicum Cooke & Massee (Hall et al. 2007). Over the
past two decades the harvest and sale of the Chinese black truﬄe, T. indicum,
has increased dramatically and has become a signiﬁcant source of income for
the local farmers who live in the mountainous truﬄe-producing regions. The
two new Tuber species we describe here are based on specimens collected by
these local farmers.#Misc-exposition*]

University). The macroscopic characteristics were described from both fresh and
rehydrated specimens. The microscopic characteristics are described from razor-blade
sections of the specimens mounted in 3% KOH, Melzer’s reagent, or cotton blue. For
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ascospores were scraped from dried gleba of the
fruit bodies and mounted in distilled water on a cover glass. After air drying the cover
glasses were directly attached to a SEM stub with doubled-sided tape, and then coated
with gold-palladium. The treated materials were examined and photographed with a
Hitachi S-4800 SEM.
[@Molecular methods#Section-header*]

Herbarium samples were crushed by shaking for 3 min at 30 Hz (Mixer Mill MM 301,
Retsch, Haan, Germany) in a 1.5 ml tube together with one 3 mm in diameter tungsten
carbide ball. Total genomic DNA was then extracted using the PeqLab E.Z.N.A._Fungal
DNA kit following the manufacturer’s protocol. The ITS region was ampliﬁed with
PCR using the primers ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990). PCR was performed in 50 µl
reactions containing DNA template 2 µl, primer (10 µM/L) 2 µl each, 2× Master Mix
(Tiangen Biotech (Beijing) Co. Ltd.) 25 µl. PCR reactions were run as follows: an initial
denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95 °C for 2 min, 55 °C for 25 s,
72 °C for 2 min, and a ﬁnal extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were sent
to Invitrogen Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China) for purifying, sequencing, and
editing. The other sequence data of ITS rDNA included in this study were downloaded
from GenBank. GenBank numbers are shown in Table 1.
[@Phylogenetic analyses#Section-header*]

DNA sequences were aligned with Clustal X (Thompson et al. 1997). The alignment
was manually adjusted with Se-Al v.2.03a (Rambaut 2000). The aligned dataset was
analyzed with maximum parsimony (MP) using PAUP*4.0b10 (Swoﬀord 2002).

Tuber species with spiny and spinulose-reticulate ornamentation on the ascospore surface, using
T. aestivum as outgroups. Bootstrap values of more than 70% from 1000 replications are shown
above the respective branches.#Figure*]

Maximum parsimony analysis was conducted using heuristic searches with 1000
replicates of random-addition sequence, tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch
swapping algorithm. All characters were equally weighted and unordered. Gaps were
treated as missing data to minimize homology assumptions. A bootstrap (BS) analysis
was performed with 1000 replicates, each with 10 random taxon addition sequences.
TBR branch swapping was employed.#Materials-methods*]

or less umbilicate in T. polyspermum) and the color of the gleba (darker in
T. polyspermum). It is clear that these diﬀerences alone are insuﬃcient to erect a
new species. However, the molecular analysis showed that the Chinese material
did not group in the same clade with T. lyonii, and instead was in a clade of its
own (Fig. 1). Because of this and the clear geographic separation between Asia

[@408 ... Fan, Hou & Cao#Page-header*]
and North America, we here treat the Chinese material as a new species that is
similar to, but distinct from, T. lyonii.
A very interesting characteristic of T. polyspermum is the very large number
of ascospores in the mature ascomata in the type specimen, especially in the
dried specimens, when compared with other Tuber species. The speciﬁc epithet
“polyspermum” refers to this.#Comments*]

[@Comments —Tuber huidongense Y. Wang, a common endemic species in
Sichuan and Yunnan (Deng et al. 2009), is similar to T. sinoalbidum in ascospore
ornamentation, but diﬀers in having brown ascomata when fresh, and a
blackish colored gleba at maturity. Also T. huidongense ascomata are normally
small, rather than medium to large as in T. sinoalbidum. The phylogenetic
analysis (Fig. 1) also shows that while T. huidongense groups in a clade with
T. sinoalbidum, the bootstrap support value is low. This indicates they are
closely related but clearly separate. Therefore, we conclude that T. sinoalbidum
is a distinct species.

The color of T. sinoalbidum when fresh is similar to that of T. magnatum
and T. latisporum Juan Chen & P.G. Liu, but they can be separated easily from
the new species by the typical reticulate ascospore ornamentations in both
T. magnatum and T. latisporum (Riousset et al. 2001; Chen & Liu 2007).#Comments*]
