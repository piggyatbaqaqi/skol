[@Abstract —Exserohilum neoregeliae is described from Neoregelia carolinae leaves imported
from the Netherlands at plant quarantine inspection in Japan. The new fungal species is
characterized by long rostrate conidia with an obconic basal end cell with a distinct hilum.
ITS + 5.8SrDNA sequence analyses revealed that E. neoregeliae forms a monophyletic group
with E. minor.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Neoregelia carolinae (Beer) L.B. Sm. (Bromeliaceae) is an ornamental plant
native to South America (Takabayashi 1994). In May 2006, brown spindleshaped lesions were found on N. carolinae leaves imported from the Netherlands
during plant quarantine inspection at Narita International Airport in Japan.
A new species of Exserohilum isolated from the lesions is described based on its
distinctive conidial morphology. In addition, molecular phylogenetic analyses
were carried out on the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (rDNAITS), including 5.8S rDNA.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Isolates (IM201-c, -d, -e, -f) were obtained from four lesions on the leaves of N.
carolinae and used for morphological observation, pathogenicity tests, and molecular
phylogenetic analyses. For morphological observation, the isolates were incubated
on V8 juice agar under alternating 12 h black light blue (BLB)/12 h darkness at 25°C
for about 20 days, and the resulting anamorph was observed under light microscopy.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted by placing V8 juice agar pieces, including hyphae,
on needle-wounded leaves of the original host that was grown in a greenhouse for four

months. The aseptic V8 juice agar pieces were placed in the same way as a control. The
inoculated plants were kept in a plastic case with a cover to maintain high humidity for
2 days. Then they were kept at room temperature under natural light after uncovering.
The ITS+5.8S rDNA were ampliﬁed with ITS1/4 primers (White et al. 1990), sequenced
directly, and analyzed to reveal the phylogenetic relationship of the new species with
other Exserohilum species registered in the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ; see also
Berbee et al. 1999, Chung et al. 2005). The DNA sequences were aligned using ClustalX
v2.0.7 (Larkin et al. 2007). Phylogenies were generated using distance methods. The
distance matrix for the aligned sequences was calculated using Kimura’s two-parameter
method (Kimura 1980) and was analyzed with the neighbor-joining method (Saitou &
Nei 1987) using ClustalX v2.0.7 (Larkin et al. 2007). The sequences of isolates IM201-d
and IM201-e were registered in DDBJ as AB607956 and AB607957, respectively.#Materials-methods*]
[@Symptoms#Section-header*]

[@The brown spindle-shaped lesions were usually observed in the center of
the leaves (Fig. 1A, B) but occasionally near the leaf margin (Fig. 1C). Some
lesions elongated along the veins or turned grayish white with brown margins,
producing leaf blight. No sporulation was detected from any lesions under
natural conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Key characters — The conidial morphology of E. neoregeliae is similar to
that of E. longisporum G.Y. Sun (Sun et al. 1997), E. rostratum (Drechsler) K.J.
Leonard & Suggs, E. longirostratum (Subram.) Sivan., and E. minor Alcorn
(Sivanesan 1987) but does show diﬀerences (Table 1). Although concolorous
and narrowly obclavate or rostrate conidia are common to both, the conidial basal
end cell often bulges slightly in E. longisporum but is obconic in E. neoregeliae.
While the conidial basal end cells are often cut oﬀ by thick dark septa in both
E. rostratum and E. longirostratum, in E. neoregeliae all septa are concolorous.
The conidia of E. neoregeliae are broader than those of E. longisporum and
shorter than those of E. longirostratum. The conidia of E. minor are not rostrate
but fusiform, although the obconic basal end cell is especially similar to that of
E. neoregeliae.#Comments*]

[@Approximately twenty days after inoculation, symptoms similar to the
natural ones were reproduced, and inoculated fungi were readily reisolated
from the lesions (Fig. 1D), whereas controls remained symptom-free.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to the neighbor-joining tree derived from ITS+5.8S rDNA
sequences made in this study, the two E. neoregeliae isolates (AB607956 and
AB607957) form a monophyletic group (100% bootstrap value) close to
E. minor (AF071341) (Fig. 2). However, the 91.6% (489/534 bp) sequence
similarity between E. neoregeliae and E. minor indicates that those two species
clearly diﬀer. Moreover, despite similar conidial morphologies, E. neoregeliae is
