[@Abstract — A new species and three new Chinese records of Hymenochaete are reported:
H. yunnanensis sp. nov., H. fulva, H. spathulata, and H. sphaerospora. They were all collected
from Caiyanghe Nature Reserve, Yunnan Province, southwestern China. Hymenochaete
yunnanensis (in sect. Hymenochaete) is characterized by setal hyphae and heavily encrusted
hyphae and hymenial cells. Complete descriptions with illustrations are provided for the four
species.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Because of the abundant woody plants and the complex topography, the
diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi is extremely high in Yunnan Province and
adjacent areas of southwestern China. During the last decade, the porioid woodinhabiting fungi in these areas have been intensively investigated and many
papers were published (Cui et al. 2011; Dai & Zhou 2000, Dai et al. 2007, Dai
2010, 2011a; Niemelä et al. 2001; Yu et al. 2008; Yuan & Dai 2008a,b). However,
the corticioid wood-inhabiting fungi in these areas have not been suﬃciently
studied. The corticioid genus, Hymenochaete Lév., is one of the most important
genera in the Hymenochaetaceae. Although it has been studied by several
mycologists (Dai 2010, 2011b; Maekawa & Zang 1995; Xu et al. 2003; Zhang &
Dai 2005), the genus has not yet been systematically studied in southwestern
China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Caiyanghe Natural Reserve, located in southern Yunnan Province, is one of
the famous nature reserves in China because it is a transitional area from the
tropical to the subtropical zone with the altitude ranging from 980–1707 m.
The main vegetation type is a monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest, comprising

[@412 ... He & Li#Page-header*]
mainly species of Castanopsis, Lithocarpus and Schima (Jing & Chen 2007). In
the summer of 2011, an intensive survey of wood-inhabiting fungi in Caiyanghe
and Xishuangbannan Natural Reserve, southern Yunnan Province, was carried
out and more than 130 Hymenochaete specimens were collected. Among
these specimens, Hymenochaete yunnanensis is identiﬁed as a new species. In
addition, H. fulva, H. spathulata and H. sphaerospora are found in China for the
ﬁrst time. Illustrated descriptions of these species are provided in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Voucher specimens are deposited in the herbarium of Beijing Forestry University
(BJFC), and the microscopic procedure follows He (2010). In the text the following
abbreviations are used: L = mean spore length (arithmetical average of all spores), W =
mean spore width (arithmetical average of all spores), Q = variation in the L/W ratios
between the specimens studied (quotient of the mean spore length and the mean spore
width of each specimen), n = the number of spores measured from given number of
specimens. In presenting the size range of spores, 5% of the measurements were excluded
from each end of the range, and the measurements were given in parentheses. IKI stands
for Melzer’s reagent, KOH for 5% potassium hydroxide, and CB is the abbreviation of
Cotton Blue. IKI– = inamyloid and nondextrinoid, CB– = acyanophilous. Special color
terms follow Petersen (1996).#Materials-methods*]

[@Fig. 1. Basidiocarps of Hymenochaete yunnanensis (He 709, holotype).#Figure*]

Hyphal structure: Hyphal system subdimitic; generative hyphae without
clamp connections; tissue darkening but otherwise unchanged in KOH.
Subiculum: Cortex, tomentum and hyphal layer present. Cortex composed
of strongly agglutinated hyphae, 20–50 µm thick. Generative hyphae hyaline
to yellowish brown, thin- to thick-walled, septate, moderately branched,
sometimes collapsed, more or less interwoven and agglutinated, usually heavily
encrusted with resinous matters, 2–4 µm in diam. Skeletoids with distinctly
thickened walls, reddish brown, rarely septate and branched. Setal hyphae
(embedded setae) frequently present, up to 200 µm long.
Stratified hymenium: Hyphae in this layer similar to those in subiculum,
hyaline, thick-walled, agglutinated, uprightly arranged, 2.5–4.5 µm in diam.
Setal layer thickening, composed of several rows of overlapping setae. Setae
numerous, subulate or fusiform, reddish brown, with an acute tip, projecting
up to 45 µm above the hymenium, 40–75(–80) × 6–7(–9) µm. Hymenial cells
usually heavily encrusted with resinous matters. Cystidia and hyphidia absent.
Basidia clavate, with four sterigmata and a simple septum at base, 12–20 ×
3.8–5 µm; basidioles in shape similar to basidia, but slightly smaller.
Basidiospores ellipsoid, some with tapering apex, hyaline, thin-walled,
smooth, IKI–, CB–, 5–6.5(–6.8) × (2.8–)3–3.5(–3.8) µm, L = 5.79 µm, W = 3.16

[@Remarks: Hymenochaete yunnanensis belongs to sect. Hymenochaete (presence
of cortex, hyphal layer and setal layer; Léger 1998) and is characterized by the
presence of setal hyphae and the heavily encrusted hyphae and hymenial cells.
Usually the hymenial cells are so heavily encrusted that the resinous compounds
form numerous yellowish dots on the hymenophore surface.
Microscopically, the new species is very close to H. ulmicola Corﬁxen &
Parmasto; however, H. ulmicola diﬀers in growing in the bark ﬁssures of old
living Ulmus trees and in having thicker, harder and smaller basidiocarps and
slightly larger basidiospores (5.5–7.5 × 3–4 µm; Corﬁxen & Parmasto 2005).
Another similar species, H. colliculosa (Sacc.) Parmasto, can be distinguished
from the new species by its larger setae (80–110 × 7.5–11 µm) and basidiospores
(5.5–7.5 × 3.6–4.8 µm; Parmasto 2005). Hymenochaete fulva also has encrusted
hyphae, but diﬀers from H. yunnanensis in the yellowish brown basidiocarps,
broadly ellipsoid basidiospores (5–6 × 3.2–4 µm), and absence of setal hyphae
(Parmasto 2001).#Comments*]

thinning out, distinct, paler than hymenophore surface, yellowish brown.
Hyphal structure: Hyphal system monomitic; generative hyphae without
clamp connections; tissue darkening but otherwise unchanged in KOH.
Subiculum: Tomentum absent; cortex and hyphal layer present. Cortex
composed of strongly agglutinated hyphae, 10–20 µm thick. Generative hyphae
hyaline to yellowish brown, thick-walled with a wide lumen, some lightly or
heavily encrusted with yellowish brown resinous granules, frequently septate,
moderately branched, loosely interwoven, 2.5–5 µm in diam.
Stratified hymenium: Hyphae in this layer similar to those in subiculum,
yellowish to yellowish brown, thick-walled, more or less agglutinated,
interwoven, 2–4.8 µm in diam. Crystals occasionally present in the hymenium.
Setal layer composed of 1–3 rows of overlapping setae. Setae numerous, reddish
brown, subulate, sometimes enmeshed with a hyphal sheath, with an acute tip,
projecting up to 80 µm above the hymenium, 60–100(–110) × 7–10(–11) µm.
Hyphidia absent, encrusted cystidia-like hyphal ends present. Basidia clavate,
with four sterigmata and a simple septum at base, 15–22 × 4–5 µm; basidioles
in shape similar to basidia, but slightly smaller.
Spores: Basidiospores broadly ellipsoid, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth,
usually bearing a large guttule, IKI–, CB–, (4.8–)5–6 × 3.5–4 µm, L = 5.43 µm,
W = 3.82 µm, Q = 1.40–1.44 (n = 60/2).#Description*]

[@Remarks: Hymenochaete fulva belongs to sect. Hymenochaete and is
characterized by its yellowish brown basidiocarps, encrusted hyphae, and
broadly ellipsoid basidiospores. The “cystidia” of the species cited by Burt
(1918) and Léger (1998) are actually encrusted hyphal ends (Parmasto 2001).
Hymenochaete fulva has also been reported in Mexico and Jamaica (Parmasto
2001). The species is close to H. rhododendricola S.H. He & Hai J. Li and H.
rhabarbarina (Berk.) Cooke; however, both species diﬀer from H. fulva in their
encrusted setae and absence of cortices (He & Li 2011a; Parmasto 2001).#Comments*]
