[@Abstract— Basidiomata of three earthstars —Geastrum campestre, G. corollinum,
G. hungaricum— were collected from sand dunes of the Japanese coasts. Those arenicolous
fungi are newly recorded for Japanese mycobiota. Descriptions, comments and illustrations
of basidiomata of the three fungi are provided.#Abstract*]

Introduction

[@The genus Geastrum Pers. belongs to Geastrales, Phallomycetidae (Hosaka et
al. 2006) and includes currently about 50 taxa (Kirk et al. 2008). Most species of
the genus are known as saprobes and are distributed throughout all continents
except Antarctica. Several authors have systematically revised Geastrum
(Staněk 1958, Ponce de Leon 1968, Dörfelt & Müller-Uri 1984, Dörfelt &
Heklau 1987, Sunhede 1989). Several species have been recorded from multiple
continents, although their taxonomic identities are doubtful because there are
only a few molecular phylogenetic studies. Our preliminary morphological
and phylogeographical analyses of the globally distributed “G. triplex Jungh.”
indicate that the name represents an aggregation of multiple species (Kasuya
et al. 2011a). This suggests the possible existence of many cryptic species in the
genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2 ... Kasuya & al.#Page-header*]
[@Although 18 Geastrum species have hitherto been recognized from Japan
(Imai 1936, Kawamura 1954, Ito 1959, Yoshimi & Hongo 1989, Sakamoto &
Kasuya 2008, Kasuya et al. 2009, 2011b), comprehensive taxonomical and
biogeographical studies of the genus have not yet been conducted. Therefore,
to clarify the geographical distribution, morphological variations, and
phylogenetic positions of Japanese Geastrum, we conducted morphological
and molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus based on the materials from
multiple localities including Japan and other continents (Kasuya et al. 2011a).
Several Geastrum species favor semiarid to arid environments, e.g., welldrained sandy soils of coasts, deserts, and inland steppes. During our recent
ﬂoristic and taxonomic investigations of Japanese Geastrum (Sakamoto &
Kasuya 2008, Kasuya et al. 2009, 2011b), we recorded G. kotlabae V.J. Staněk,
G. minimum Schwein., and G. quadriﬁdum Pers. from coastal sand dunes of
Hokkaido and Honshu.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Some noteworthy Geastrum collections obtained by further ﬁeldwork
conducted in sand dunes along the Japanese coasts include G. campestre,
G. corollinum, and G. hungaricum, which represent new distributional records
for Japan. We describe the Japanese collections of these three species with the
aid of illustrations showing morphological characters. We also compare them
with related taxa and discuss the biogeographical and ecological features of the
species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Fieldwork was carried out from September 2003 to October 2010 at three sites in
coastal sand dunes of Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan: (1) Minehama, Shari, Hokkaido
(43°55ʹ34ʺN, 144°46ʹ18ʺE); (2) Hitachi Kaihin Park, Hitachinaka, Ibaraki (36°23ʹ54ʺN,
140°36ʹ24ʺE); and (3) Fukude, Iwata, Shizuoka (34°39ʹ51ʺN, 137°53ʹ22ʺE). These sites
well preserve coastal vegetation dominated by poaceous and cyperaceous plants. For
morphological comparisons, we examined one additional G. corollinum specimen
collected from an inland area of Honshu.
The examined specimens are deposited in the mycological herbarium of the National
Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan (TNS). Macroscopic characters
were described from dried and fresh material. For light microscopic observations,
freehand sections of the specimens were mounted in water, 3% (w/v) KOH, and 30%
ethanol solution on glass slides. Forty randomly selected basidiospores were measured
under a light microscope at 1000× magniﬁcation. Length measurements excluded the
apiculus; average dimensions ± standard deviations are shown in brackets. The surface
features of basidiospores were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
For SEM, a small portion of the gleba was dusted onto double-sided adhesive tape on a
specimen holder, coated with platinum-palladium using an E-1030 Ion Sputter Coater
(Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and examined with a S-4200 SEM (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan)
operating at 20 kV.#Materials-methods*]

[@Comments: Geastrum campestre is well characterized by hygroscopic exoperidial
rays, a mycelial layer encrusted with sand or debris, a stalked endoperidial body,
and a distinctly delimited, plicate peristome. The morphology of the Japanese
specimens agrees well with previous descriptions of G. campestre (Cunningham
1944, Long & Stouﬀer 1948, Sunhede 1989). However, the expanded Japanese
basidiomata are usually smaller (≤ 37 mm wide when wet) than European
specimens (≤ 65 mm wide, Sunhede 1989).
Geastrum kotlabae and G. pouzarii V.J. Staněk are morphologically and
ecologically very similar to G. campestre. All three species have hygroscopic
exoperidial rays and plicate peristomes and share similar habitats such as welldrained, sandy soil. However, the endoperidial body of G. kotlabae is completely
sessile (Sunhede 1989, Sakamoto & Kasuya 2008). Basidiospores of G. pouzarii
are larger (5.5–7 μm diam. including ornaments, Sunhede 1989) than those of
G. campestre. Moreover, the mycelial layer of both G. kotlabae and G. pouzarii
easily peels oﬀ at basidiome expansion (Sunhede 1989, Esqueda et al. 2003)
whereas that of G. campestre remains attached to the ﬁbrous layer for a long
time. Geastrum berkeleyi Massee, which also produces stalked endoperidial
bodies and plicate peristomes, clearly diﬀers from G. campestre by its nonhygroscopic, much larger basidiomata (Kasuya et al. 2009).
Japanese material of G. campestre has been collected from sand dunes along
the Paciﬁc Ocean coast in the warm-temperate area of Eastern Honshu. The
type specimen of G. campestre was collected from Nebraska, U.S.A., where it
grows on dry open grasslands or on litter under conifers or deciduous trees
(Long & Stouﬀer 1948). European and Australian specimens have been obtained
from well-drained, sandy soil near coasts (Cunningham 1944, Sunhede 1989),
and the species has been recorded from tropical deciduous forests in Mexico
(Esqueda et al. 2003) and dry mountain forests in Hawaii (Gilbertson et al.
2001). These facts suggest that G. campestre prefers dry, well-drained open land
but can grow in a variety of environments.
Geastrum campestre is known from all continents except Antarctica and its
habitats are diverse. As several morphological variations have been reported
(Sunhede 1989), G. campestre as currently deﬁned may be a species complex.#Comments*]

[@10 ... Kasuya & al.#Page-header*]
agrees well with previous descriptions of G. corollinum (Hollós 1904, Dissing &
Lange 1962, Sunhede 1989). However, the pseudoparenchymatous layer of the
exoperidium of the Japanese material is thinner (≤ 0.5 mm thick) than that of
European material (0.5–1.5 mm thick, Sunhede 1989).
Geastrum ﬂoriforme Vittad. and G. hungaricum are morphologically similar
to G. corollinum. However, G. ﬂoriforme basidiomata are hypogeous when
unexpanded and have indistinctly delimited peristomes and the mycelial layer
is encrusted with sand or plant debris (Sunhede 1989). For comparison with
G. hungaricum, see description and comments below. Geastrum arenarium
Lloyd, which resembles G. corollinum macroscopically, diﬀers in its mycelial
layer strongly encrusted with sand or plant debris (Sunhede 1989) and smaller
basidiospores of G. arenarium (3.5–4.5 μm diam. including ornaments,
Sunhede 1986).
Japanese specimens of G. corollinum have been collected from coastal
sand dunes along the Paciﬁc Ocean and under broad-leaved forests of warmtemperate areas of Central Honshu. In Europe, the type locality of G. corollinum,
it has been obtained from various habitats, under deciduous trees (Dissing &
Lange 1962, Sunhede 1989), under Juniperus communis (Sunhede 1989), and
in sandy grasslands (Dörfelt et al. 1979) and coastal dunes (Eyndhoven 1937).
Chinese specimens have been collected from grasslands, grazed ﬁelds and under
Cryptomeria japonica or several salicaceous trees (Zhou et al. 2007). Geastrum
corollinum has also been recorded from tropical deciduous forests in Mexico
(Esqueda et al. 2003) and dry, coastal to montane forests in Hawaii (Gilbertson
et al. 2001). Ecologically, these facts suggest that the present fungus adapts to
varied environments. In Japan, further ﬁeldwork is needed to clarify whether
the distribution of G. corollinum is limited to coastal sand dunes or not.
Geastrum corollinum has been recorded from all continents except
Antarctica. Given the variable morphological characters (Dissing & Lange
1962, Sunhede 1989) and diverse habitats, G. corollinum probably comprises a
species complex.#Comments*]

Two other small-sized earthstars, G. corollinum and G. ﬂoriforme, resemble

epigeous, onion-shaped with an umbo, with brownish surfaces, and not
encrusted with sand or plant debris (Sunhede 1989; see also our description
of G. corollinum, above) and the expanded basidiomata are larger (≤ 23 mm
diam., Sunhede 1989). Geastrum ﬂoriforme clearly diﬀers from G. hungaricum
by its indistinctly delimited peristome, smooth endoperidial surfaces, and
larger basidiospores (≤ 7 μm diam., Sunhede 1989).
Japanese material of G. hungaricum was collected from a coastal sand dune

the type was collected from Hungary. In Europe it has been collected from
sandy, rocky or grazed ground (Hollós 1904, Staněk 1958, Sunhede 1989), and
Russian or Mongolian specimens were also found in semiarid areas (Hollós
1904, Dörfelt & Otto 1985), suggesting that G. hungaricum habitats are limited
to dry, sandy, stony or grazed ground in northern cool-temperate regions.#Comments*]
