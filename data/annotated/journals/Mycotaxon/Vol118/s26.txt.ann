[@Abstract—A fungus found on leaves of Osmanthus fragrans from Mt Huangshan in
Anhui Province, China, is described as Coccomyces minimus. The new species is similar
to C. cyclobalanopsis but diﬀers in the extremely small, subepidermal ascomata and in the
presence of conidiomata. The type specimen is deposited in the Forest Fungi Dried Reference
Collection of Anhui Agricultural University, China (AAUF). Both illustration and comments
accompany the description.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Coccomyces De Not. is the second-largest genus in the Rhytismataceae
(Rhytismatales, Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota) (Kirk et al. 2008). Members of this
genus are characterized by polygonal to more or less circular ascomata opening
by several radiate or irregular splits, cylindrical to clavate asci, and ﬁliform to
fusiform ascospores, often with gelatinous sheaths (Sherwood 1980; Cannon &
Minter 1986; Johnston 1986, 2000; Spooner 1990; Lin et al. 1994).
Of the 116 Coccomyces species known worldwide (Kirk et al. 2008), 23 have
been reported from China (Korf & Zhuang 1985; Lin 1998; Hou et al. 2006,
2007). They are widely distributed and inhabit leaves, twigs, bark, or wood
of vascular plants, especially Ericaceae, Fagaceae, and Lauraceae (Sherwood
1980). Some species, such as C. guizhouensis Y.R. Lin & B.F. Hu, C. ledi Rehm,
C. leptideus (Fr.) B. Erikss., C. strobi J. Reid & Cain, and C. vilis Syd. et al.,
may cause plant disease of economic signiﬁcance (Lin et al. 1994, Rehm 1913,
Sherwood 1980, Reid & Cain 1961, Cannon & Minter 1984).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present paper, C. minimus on leaves of Osmanthus fragrans (Thunb.)
Lour. (Oleaceae) from Mt Huangshan in Anhui Province, China, is described
as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Pieces of plant material bearing fruit bodies containing asci and ascospores were
selected. Sections of the fruitbodies 10–15 μm thick were cut using a freezing microtome
and mounted in water, Melzer’s reagent, 5% KOH, or 0.1% (w/v) cotton blue in lactic
acid for microscopical observation. Gelatinous sheaths surrounding ascospores and
paraphyses were observed in water or cotton blue in lactic acid. Measurements were
made using material mounted in 5% KOH or Melzer’s reagent from more than 20
ascospores, asci and paraphyses per ascoma. Point and line integrated illustrations of
external shapes and internal structures of fruit bodies were prepared using a microscope
drawing device.#Materials-methods*]

[@Zone lines frequent, grey-black or black, thin, entirely or partly surrounding
the bleached spots.
Conidiomata developing on both sides of leaves, mostly on the lower
side of the leaf, scattered to crowded. In surface view, conidiomata 100−220
µm diam., rotund or slightly irregular, black-brown in the centre and the
perimeter line of the conidioma, grey-brown elsewhere, somewhat raising the
leaf surface, discharging spores through an apical ostiole. In vertical section,
conidiomata subepidermal, more or less double lens-shaped. Upper wall
poorly developed, dark brown, with indeﬁnite structure. Basal wall 8−14
µm thick, black-brown, strongly black and brittle, consisting of 2−3(−4) layers
of thick-walled angular cells 3−6 µm diam. Subconidiogenous layer 5−7

cylindrical, hyaline, aseptate.
Ascomata in similar positions on the host, scattered to crowded in yellowbrown or grey-yellow, irregular bleached spots 5−12 mm diam. In surface view,
ascomata black-brown to black, slightly shiny, triangular to hexagonal, 300−690
µm diam., strongly raising the substratum surface but depressed in the central
area, with an obvious performed dehiscence mechanism, opening by 3−6 radial
splits, which nearly extend to the edge of ascoma, to expose the waxy-yellow
hymenium. Lips not seen. In median vertical section, ascomata subepidermal,
150−190 µm deep. Covering stroma 16−20 µm thick near the opening,
slightly thinner towards the edge, connecting to the basal stroma, consisting of
textura angularis-globulosa with dark brown or black-brown, thick-walled cells
3−5 µm diam. Periphysoids not seen. Basal stroma 12−22 µm thick, strongly
black and brittle, composed of textura angularis with 2−3(−4) layers of blackbrown, thick-walled cells 4−6 µm diam. Internal matrix of stroma well
developed, 12−25 µm thick, consisting of hyaline, gelatinised textura intricata.
Excipulum arising from the marginal paraphyses, 20−25 µm wide above,

Ascospores fasciculate, 50−72 × 0.8−1.0 µm, hyaline, ﬁliform, aseptate, slightly
tapered towards the base, covered by a ca 0.8 µm thick gelatinous sheath.#Description*]

[@Comments—Coccomyces minimus resembles C. cyclobalanopsis Y.R. Lin &
Z.Z. Li in the shape of paraphyses, asci, and ascospores as well as in the color of
the exposed hymenium. However, C. cyclobalanopsis has larger, intraepidermal
ascomata (400−900 µm diam.) without conidiomata, a thinner basal stroma
(7−10 µm thick), a well-developed subhymenium (20−28 µm thick), much
longer paraphyses (110−130 µm) and asci (90−115 µm), and an upper part of
the excipulum 30−50 µm thick arising from inner cells of the covering stroma
(Lin et al. 2000).
Coccomyces multangularis Y.R. Lin & Z.Z. Li is easily distinguished from
C. minimus by its 3–9-sided much larger (500−1100 µm diam.) ascomata, the
35−50 µm thick upper portion of the excipulum, infrequent periphysoids, and
slightly longer asci (85−105 µm) (Lin et al. 2001).

[@Coccomyces minimus sp. nov. (China) ... 235#Page-header*]

The similar C. concolor Sherwood diﬀers in its orbicular ascomata lacking a
performed dehiscence mechanism, the covering stroma comprising 1−2 layers
of loosely interwoven brown hyphae 2−3 µm diam. that are not black and
brittle, the thicker (40−50 µm) excipulum, the swollen (5−6 µm) paraphyses
apices, and the much longer asci (80−120 µm) and ascospores (70−100 µm)
(Sherwood 1980).#Comments*]
