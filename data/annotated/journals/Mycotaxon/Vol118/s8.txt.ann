[@Abstract — A new species of Diversispora (Glomeromycetes) was found in saline sand dunes
of the Natural Park Cabo de Gata (Almería, Andalucía, Southern Spain) in the rhizosphere
of Asteriscus maritimus, a plant species especially adapted to saline environments. The new
fungal species forms brilliant white spores that are 79–130 × 75–125 µm and have one wall
consisting of three layers. The subtending hyphae are, as typical for many Diversispora spp.,
thin-walled, hyaline, and cylindrical (or rarely constricted) and ﬂexible and fragile below the
septa separating the spore and hyphal contents. The septa form regularly at the spore bases
or, less frequently, in subtending hyphae at short distances from the spore base. Phylogenetic
analyses of the ITS and partial 28S ribosomal gene conﬁrm that D. clara forms a monophyletic,
independent clade within Diversispora.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@During recent studies on arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungal diversity
in sand dune systems of the Cabo de Gata Natural Park in Almería (Spain),
a brilliant-white new glomeromycotean fungus was recovered from the
rhizosphere of Asteriscus maritimus, a plant species characteristic of saline
Mediterranean environments with elevated soil electrical conductivity. The
new fungus formed spores in AM fungal bait cultures predominantly in the
Asteriscus maritimus rhizosphere. The aims of the present study were to analyze
this particular fungus applying combined morphological and molecular tools
and to describe its characteristics.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material & methods
[@Soil and plant sampling#Section-header*]

Soil samples were taken in February 2010 from the rhizosphere of ten Asteriscus
maritimus plants growing in a natural sand dune system of the Natural Park Cabo de Gata
in Almería (Andalucía, Spain). The site is located at 36°44ʹ41ʺN 02°07ʹ26ʺE. The samples,
air-dried in the laboratory, were used to analyze selected chemical soil parameters (pH,
soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil electrical conductivity) and spore populations.
The ten plants and the surrounding rhizosphere soil were also extracted and used as
bait cultures for propagation of AM fungal communities indigenous to the natural sand
dune system. At the site, the soil was sandy and with pH (H2O) 8.2, organic carbon 15.3
g kg–1, total nitrogen 1.9 g kg–1, available P 27.0 mg kg–1, and soil electrical conductivity
1.5 µS cm–1.
[@AM fungal bait cultures#Section-header*]

Bait cultures were established and maintained as described in Palenzuela et al. (2008,
2011) by transplanting 10 Asteriscus maritimus plants with their rhizosphere soils into
1 L pots and transferring them to the greenhouse at EEZ in Granada immediately after
sampling. The pots were irrigated three times per week and fertilized every four weeks
with Long-Aston nutrient solution (Hewitt 1966). Pure cultures of the new fungus were
initiated in a mixed-culture of three Allium porrum L. and three Hieracium pilosella
L. plantlets in 750 mL pots grown together at three locations in the pots. The plant
rhizosphere was inoculated with 20 spores per pot and pot location. A sterile mixture
of Terragreen (American aluminum oxide, Oil Dry US special, type III R; Lobbe
Umwelttechnik Iserlohn, Germany) and Loess (mixture 3:1; with pH-KCl 6.2; organic
carbon 0.3%; available P (Na-acetate) 2.6 mg kg–1; available K (Na-acetate) 350 mg kg–1
was chosen as culture substrate (Oehl et al. 2002). So far, pure cultures of the new fungus
have not been obtained.
[@Morphological analyses#Section-header*]

AM fungal spores were separated from the soil samples by a wet sieving process
(Sieverding 1991). The morphological spore characteristics and their subcellular
structures were described from a specimen mounted in: polyvinyl alcohol-lactic acidglycerol (PVLG; Koske and Tessier 1983); a mixture of PVLG and Melzer’s reagent
(Brundrett et al. 1994); a mixture of lactic acid to water at 1:1; Melzer’s reagent; and
water (Spain 1990). The spore structure terminology follows Oehl et al. (2003, 2005,
2011a) for species with glomoid or diversisporoid spore formation. Photographs (Figs
1–10) were taken with a Leica DFC 290 digital camera on a Leitz Laborlux S compound
microscope using Leica Application Suite Version V 2.5.0 R1 software. Specimens
mounted in PVLG and the PVLG+Melzer’s mixtures were deposited at the herbaria
Z+ZT (ETH Zurich, Switzerland), GDA-GDAC (University of Granada, Spain), and
URM (Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife).
Molecular analyses

Five spores isolated from the trap cultures were surface-sterilized with chloramine
T (2%) and streptomycin (0.02%) (Mosse 1962) and crushed with a sterile disposable
micropestle in 40 µL milli-Q water (Ferrol et al. 2004). PCRs of the crude extracts

[@Diversispora clara sp. nov. (Spain) ... 75#Page-header*]

were obtained in an automated thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System 2400, PerkinElmer, Foster City, California) with a pureTaq Ready-To-Go PCR Bead (Amersham
Biosciences Europe GmbH, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions with 0.4
μM concentration of each primer. A two-step PCR ampliﬁed the partial SSU, ITS1,
5.8S, ITS2 and partial LSU rDNA ribosomal fragment using the SSUmAf/LSUmAr
and SSUmCf/LSUmBr primers consecutively (Krüger et al. 2009). The second PCR
products were separated electrophoretically on 1.2% agarose gels stained with Gel Red™
(Biotium Inc., Hayward, CA, U.S.A.) and viewed by UV illumination. The band of the
expected size was excised with a scalpel and the ampliﬁed DNA was isolated from the
gel with the QIAEX II Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA), cloned into the
PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbard, CA, USA), and transformed into one shot TOP10
chemically competent Escherichia coli cells. After plasmid isolation from transformed
cells, cloned DNA fragments were sequenced with vector primers (White et al. 1990) in
both directions by Taq polymerase cycle sequencing on an automated DNA sequencer
(Perkin-Elmer ABI Prism 373). Sequence data were compared to gene libraries (EMBL
and GenBank) using BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990). The new sequences were deposited in
the EMBL database under the accession numbers FR873629–FR873633.
Phylogenetic analyses: The AM rDNA ITS1+5.8S +ITS2 fungal sequences were
aligned in ClustalX (Larkin et al. 2007) and edited with BioEdit (Hall 1999) to obtain
a ﬁnal alignment with Acaulospora laevis Gerd. & Trappe and A. lacunosa J.B. Morton
as outgroups. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, the model of nucleotide substitution
was estimated using Topali 2.5 (Milne et al. 2004). Bayesian (two runs over 1 × 106
generations with a burn in value of 2500) and maximum likelihood (1000 bootstrap)
analyses were performed in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) and PhyML
(Guindon & Gascuel 2003) respectively, launched from Topali 2.5, using the GTR +
G model. Neighbor-joining (established with the model cited above) and maximum
parsimony analyses were performed using PAUP*4b10 (Swoﬀord 2003) with 1000
bootstrap replications.#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion

Our morphological analyses, in particular those of the subtending hyphae
and spore bases, clearly support the new fungus in Diversispora, with many
characters identical to those of other Diversispora species (e.g., D. spurca,
D. eburnea; see Oehl et al. 2011a,b) such as the thin-walled, hyaline, cylindrical
(or rarely constricted) subtending hyphae that appear ﬂexible and fragile behind
the septum that closes the pore at the spore base or in short distance from the
base. In Diversispora species with pigmented spores, the subtending hyphae
regularly change color conspicuously, becoming hyaline to white behind the
septum (Oehl et al. 2011a). This color change, however, was not conﬁrmed for
D. clara, since the new fungus generally does not form pigmented spores.
Molecular analyses conﬁrm the species as new: in the phylogenetic tree,
D. clara clusters in a independent, monophyletic clade within a polyphyletic
Diversispora. These sequence analyses also conﬁrm unequivocally using
morphology to identify diversisporoid species within the Glomeromycota (Oehl
et al. 2011a,c).
Including D. clara, there are now 14 Diversispora spp. known in the
Glomeromycetes (Oehl et al. 2011a,b). The 9 species that form signiﬁcantly
pigmented, yellow brown to brown or orange to orange brown spores are
D. arenaria (Błaszk. et al.) Oehl et al., D. aurantia (Błaszk. et al.) C. Walker
& A. Schüssler, D. epigaea (B.A. Daniels & Trappe) C. Walker & A. Schüssler,#Misc-exposition*]

D. pustulata (Koske et al.) Oehl et al., D. tenera (P.A. Tandy) Oehl et al.,
D. trimurales (Koske & Halvorson) C. Walker & A. Schüssler, and D. versiformis
(P. Karst.) Oehl et al. (Oehl et al. 2011a,b). Diversispora celata C. Walker et
al. forms triple-layered, ochre to ivory to pinkish cream spores (Gamper et al.
2009). Only D. spurca (C.M. Pfeiﬀ. et al.) C. Walker & A. Schüssler, D. eburnea
(L.J. Kenn. et al.) C. Walker & A. Schüssler, and D. gibbosa (Błaszk.) Błaszk. &
Kovács form hyaline to subhyaline spores that are, however, never brilliantwhite as observed for D. clara. Moreover, D. spurca and D. eburnea have bilayered spore walls (Kennedy et al. 1999), D. gibbosa has a ﬁve-layered wall
(Błaszkowski 1997), and D. clara has a three-layered wall.
In the past, large-spored or sporocarpic AM fungi were described from sand
dune systems, such as Gigaspora, Scutellospora, Pacispora or Glomus species
that were generally easy to isolate and recognize from ﬁeld samples (Koske &
Gemma 1995, Gemma et al. 1989, Błaszkowski 1994). Likewise in the current
Cabo de Gata Natural Park sand dune system, where Funneliformis coronatus
(Giovann.) C. Walker & A. Schüssler, F. mosseae (T.H. Nicolson & Gerd.)
C. Walker & A. Schüssler, Scutellospora calospora (T.H. Nicolson & Gerd.)
C. Walker & F.E. Sanders, Racocetra persica (Koske & C. Walker) Oehl et al.,
and Glomus macrocarpum Tul & C. Tul. were identiﬁed (Estrada, unpublished).
When sand dune AM fungal communities were maintained and reproduced
in bait cultures, small-spored Glomus spp. were also sometimes detected (e.g.
Błaszkowski et al. 2009a,b, 2010). It was supposed that species with small, quickly
degrading spores were diﬃcult to recover or identify only from ﬁeld samples.
This might also be true for D. clara, even though its laminated wall structure
is clearly persistent. It will be interesting to see whether future taxonomists
will be able to identify the new species directly from ﬁeld samples, now that
the existence and morphology of this unique, brilliant-white, conspicuous but
small-spored species is known. Morphological spore and molecular root and
spore analyses will hopefully tell us more about the ecology and biogeography
of this fungus that is thus far known only from a single Asteriscus maritimus
rhizosphere in the Natural Park Cabo de Gata of Almería in southern Spain.#Comments*]
