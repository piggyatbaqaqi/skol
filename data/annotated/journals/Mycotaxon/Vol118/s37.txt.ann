[@Abstract—Seven members of the Rhytismataceae are reported from leaves of tanoaks from
Mt Huangshan, China. Among them Coccomyces mucronatoides and Terriera coacervata
are new species, Terriera illiciicola is a new combination, and the other species are already
known for China. This paper provides descriptions, discussions for these species as well
as a dichotomous key for the eight rhytismataceous species known to occur on tanoaks
worldwide.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Worldwide, at least 55 genera (+ 30 synonyms) and 728 species of
Rhytismataceae have been reported (Kirk et al. 2008). These fungi are parasites on
leaves, stems, twigs, or fruits of gymnosperms, angiosperms and pteridophytes
or saprobes on plant residues. More than 240 diﬀerent fungi have been
discovered on Lithocarpus spp. (Fagaceae), but records of the Rhytismataceae
are few (Farr & Rossman 2011). Coccomyces dentatus (J.C. Schmidt & Kunze)
Sacc. on Lithocarpus densiﬂorus (Hook. & Arn.) Rehd. is known from the USA
(Sherwood 1980), and ﬁve Rhytismataceae species —C. delta, C. huangshanensis,
C. mucronatus, Lophodermium agathidis, L. illiciicola— have been reported on
Lithocarpus spp. from China (Lin et al. 2000a,b, 2001, 2005; Wang et al. 2006).
Mt Huangshan in southern Anhui Province is suitable for many
rhytismataceous species because of the warm climate, abundant rainfall, and
high plant diversity. Seven species representing three diﬀerent genera on
Lithocarpus leaves are described from Mt Huangshan in this paper, including
two new species, one new combination, and four species already known in
China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
Leaves with bleached spots were collected from plants on Mt Huangshan, and those
with open fruit bodies characteristic of Rhytismataceae were selected. Observations of
the external shape, size, color, opening mechanisms of ascomata and conidiomata, and
zone line characteristics were made using a stereoscope with 10–50× magniﬁcation.
Microscopic preparations were made in water, Melzer’s reagent, 5% KOH, or 0.1%
(w/v) cotton blue in lactic acid. For observing the outlines of ascomata and conidiomata,
vertical sections were mounted in lactic acid or cotton blue with water pretreatment.
Gelatinous sheaths surrounding ascospores and paraphyses were observed in water or
cotton blue in lactic acid. The color of structures and ascospore contents were observed
in water. Measurements and drawings of asci, ascospores, and paraphyses were made
from material mounted in 5% KOH or Melzer’s reagent from 30 ascospores, asci and
paraphyses for each specimen. Point and line integrated illustrations of external shapes
and internal structures of the fruit bodies were drawn using a Panasoianic XSJ-2
microscopic painting device.#Materials-methods*]

[@Comments—The species was originally described from Madeira, and mainly
occurs on plants of the Lauraceae and evergreen Quercus (Sherwood 1980).
Teng (1934) ﬁrst reported C. delta from China. According to our observation,
it infects living leaves at early stage, and may be followed by other Coccomyces
species as the ascomata mature. Compared with the polygonal species in the
genus, C. delta ascomata are the largest. The asci and ascospores in the Mt
Huangshan specimens are shorter than described by Sherwood (1980).#Comments*]

Lophodermium euryae Y.R. Lin & Y.F. He diﬀers from T. coacervata in a diﬀerent
coalescent form, the oblong, elliptical or broadly elliptical smaller ascomata
(290−650(−870) × 250−350 µm), smaller ascospores (45−70 × 0.8−1.2 µm),
paraphyses with suddenly swollen to subglobose apices branched to form an
epithecium, and the abundant conidiomata (Lin et al. 2005).
We discovered a hyperparasite — the anamorphic fungus, Cladosporium
lophodermii Georgescu & Tutunaru — in some T. coacervata collections that
infects ascomata to produce dark-brown hyphae and conidia in the interior.
Hyperparasitism is frequent in some Lophodermium taxa (Minter 1981; Lin
1989).#Comments*]

[@Zone lines frequent, black, thin, surrounding or partly surrounding the
bleached spots.
Conidiomata absent.
Ascomata developing on the upper side of leaves, crowded in yellowish to
yellow-brown bleached spots. In surface view, ascomata 300−380 × 280−330
µm, subcircular to broad-elliptical, black, shiny, with a clearly deﬁned edge,
moderately raising the surface of the substratum, opening by a longitudinal
split. Lips absent. In median vertical section, ascomata subepidermal. Covering
stroma 25−30 µm thick, consisting of black-brown textura angularis with
cells 4.5−6.5 µm diam. Along the edge of the ascomatal opening, there is
an extension, about 15 µm thick, adjacent to the covering stroma, which is
comprised of strongly carbonized tissue with no obvious cellular structure and
tends to disappear as the ascomata mature. Basal stroma concave and cupshaped, 12−18 µm thick, consisting of black-brown textura angularis with 2(−3)
layers of cells 5.0−7.5 µm diam., extending to the covering stroma. Colorless or
light brown textura prismatica 15−20 µm thick exists between the covering and
basal stromata. Subhymenium 12−15 µm thick, consisting of textura angularisporrecta. Paraphyses 115−150 × 1.0−1.5 µm, ﬁliform, the top not swollen or
branched, covered with an inconspicuous mucous coating. Asci maturing
sequentially, 90−135 × 4.0−5.0 µm, narrow-cylindrical or cylindric-clavate,
long-stalked, apex round, J−, 8-spored. Ascospores fasciculate, 65−95 × ca
1.0 µm, ﬁliform, hyaline, aseptate, enveloped in an inconspicuous gelatinous
sheath.#Description*]

[@Comments—This species was originally described as Lophodermium illiciicola
(Wang et al. 2006) and is transferred here because its diagnostic characteristics
agree with those of the genus Terriera. The species resembles T. minor (Tehon)
P.R. Johnst. (Ortiz-García et al. 2003), which can be diﬀerentiated by oblong
or elliptical larger ascomata (320−800(−1400) × 220−340 µm), a ﬂat basal
stroma, and paraphyses that branch 2−3 times at the top, sometimes forming
an epithecium (Johnston 1988, 1989b; Lin et al. 2005).#Comments*]
