[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Svrček (1987) established a monotypic genus Amicodisca Svrček, typiﬁed
by Amicodisca brdensis (Velen.) Svrček (≡ Dasyscyphus brdensis Velen.), which
is characterized by yellowish to olivaceous colored excipulum and hairs,
ascospores bearing lemon-yellow pigment dissolving in NH4OH or KOH
solutions, and ﬁmbriate dehiscence of the ascus pore. Amicodisca viridicoma
(Peck) J.H. Haines, A. svrcekii Raitv. & Huhtinen, and A. groenlandica Raitv.
were later additionally described (Haines 1989; Raitviir 2001, 2003). Since
Huhtinen (1994) proposed A. virella (P. Karst.) Huhtinen (with its earlier
basionym) as the correct name for the type species, and Raitviir (2004) listed A.
viridicoma as a synonym of A. virella, there are three species now recognized.
In the course of extensive survey on the fungal biodiversity in Korea, an
interesting discomycete with small apothecia surrounded with yellowish hairs
was collected on fallen burs of Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata Siebold
& Zucc.). Its gross morphology and microscopic features ﬁt well with those
of Amicodisca, but it is clearly diﬀerent from the known species in having
remarkably smaller asci and ascospores and by host preference. Here, we
describe and illustrate this fungus as new to science.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
Fresh materials were primarily mounted in distilled water to conﬁrm the natural
colors of their microstructures. Dried materials were revived in 3–10% aqueous KOH.
Amyloid reactions were tested by Melzer’s reagent (MLZ) or Lugol’s solution (IKI)
without KOH pretreatment. Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a drawing
tube (Olympus U-DA) was used for measurements and line drawings. Structures were
measured at 1000×; measurements are reported as follows: minimum–maximum
(length) × minimum–maximum (width) [mean length ± standard deviation × mean
width ± standard deviation, Q (l/w ratio) = average ± standard deviation]. All specimens
examined are deposited in the Herbarium of Korea University, Seoul, Korea (KUS) or
National Museum of Nature and Science, Tsukuba, Japan (TNS).#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion

Amicodisca is a small group of hyaloscyphaceous discomycetes characterized
by a lemon-yellow colored excipulum, hairs, and ascospores (Svrček 1987).
Although its dark globose ectal cells and translucent greyish hymenium
suggest a relationship to Dermateaceae, many authors (Svrček 1987; Haines
1989; Huhtinen 1994; Huhtinen & Læssøe 2001; Raitviir 2003, 2004) have
preferred to assign the genus to the Hyaloscyphaceae based on the presence of
distinct hairs. Dematioscypha Svrček is similar to Amicodisca in having a dark
excipulum and cylindric hairs with tapering apices, but diﬀerentiate the genus
by its hyaline hairs with glassy apices, inamyloid ascal pore, and association
with a Haplographium anamorph. Superﬁcially, it is also reminiscent of
Dennisiodiscus Svrček in sessile apothecia with greyish hymenium and bright
colored surrounding hairs, but diﬀers in hairs encrusted by reddish brown
granules and growing on culms or leaves of monocotyledonous hosts.
Macroscopically, the present fungus is easily discriminated from other
species by relatively large apothecia (≤ 3 mm diam.) with brownish hymenium.
In contrast, all known species of Amicodisca produce greyish or olivaceous
apothecia and are usually smaller than 1 mm in diameter. Amicodisca castaneae
is microscopically closest to A. svrcekii and A. virella, but their larger ascospores
(8–11 and 17–25 μm long, respectively) and slightly narrower paraphyses
(0.8 and 1 μm broad, respectively) are diﬀerent. Amicodisca groenlandica
strikingly diﬀers in much larger asci (92–116 × 12–15 μm) and ascospores
(20–27 × 3–5 μm).#Comments*]
[@The speciﬁcity of A. castaneae to chestnut burs seems to be another notable
feature. Hitherto all known Amicodisca species have been collected on woody
substrates (Raitviir 2004), such as Alnus, Betula, Salix, Sambucus, and other
deciduous trees.#Habitat-distribution*]
