[@Abstract — An undescribed cellulosic chytrid with multiple rhizoidal axes, JEL142,
has grouped in molecular hypotheses with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the chytrid
pathogen of amphibians, and thus is of interest for genetic and physiological comparisons.
To describe this member of the Rhizophydiales, we examined its zoospore ultrastructure and
developmental morphology. Based on a reanalysis of rDNA data plus ultrastructural and
morphological characters, we name this fungus Homolaphlyctis polyrhiza gen. et sp. nov.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@A chytrid referred to by its isolate number, JEL142, has been in phylogenies
since the ﬁrst molecular hypotheses of the Chytridiomycota (James et al.
2000, 2006; Letcher et al. 2008b) but has not been identiﬁed to species or
received a formal name. This isolate is of interest because it groups as sister
to Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis Longcore et al. (Longcore et al. 1999), the
pathogen of amphibians, and because it is one of the few members of the
Rhizophydiales Letcher (Letcher et al. 2006) that have thalli with multiple
rhizoidal axes. Although the phylogenetic distance based on branch lengths
in phylograms is large and support values for the relationship have been low
(James et al. 2006; Letcher et al. 2008b), JEL142 seems to be the closest relative
to B. dendrobatidis now in culture. In an eﬀort to identify genes that enable

[@434 ... Longcore, Letcher & James#Page-header*]
B. dendrobatidis to be pathogenic, the genome of JEL142 has been sequenced
for comparison (Joneson et al. 2011). In this paper, we reanalyze the phylogenetic
placement of JEL142 and provide a description of the ultrastructure of its
zoospore and its developmental morphology. These analyses place isolate JEL142
in the Rhizophydiales, but outside of described families or genera. Therefore we
describe a new genus and species to accommodate isolate JEL142.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
We ﬁrst observed this chytrid on onionskin bait (outer, dry bulb scales of white
onions) placed in a gross culture containing the aquatic plant Eriocaulon aquaticum,
associated debris and lake water in a deep Petri dish. The collection site was Mud Pond, a
small (1.7 ha), acidic (pH 4.6), oligotrophic and ﬁshless lake in Hancock County, Maine
(Davis et al. 1994, Rhodes & Davis 1995). With standard methods (Barr 1986) we isolated
JEL142 into pure culture on modiﬁed PmTG nutrient agar (Longcore 1992). Since initial
isolation in 1994 this chytrid has grown on nutrient agar slants with transfers at threemonth intervals and storage at ~4 °C after growth. We collected zoospores from growth
on 20 mPmTG plates and ﬁxed them for TEM with s-collidine buﬀered glutaraldehyde
followed by osmium tetroxide. Zoospores were rinsed, added to agar and en bloc stained
with uranyl acetate before embedment in epon araldite plastic (Barr 1981, Longcore
1992). Sections were examined at 60 kV. We photographed developmental morphology
of thalli grown on mPmTG nutrient agar with a Spot RT digital camera. Phylogenetic
analysis of Rhizophydiales was conducted using the initial alignments of 18S, 28S, and
5.8S rRNA subunits produced by James et al. (2006). Additional sequences were added
from Letcher et al. (2004, 2008b), and the alignment manually adjusted in MacClade
4.08 (Maddison & Maddison 1992). The phylogeny was estimated using maximum
likelihood in RAxML-7.0.4 (Stamatakis 2006) with 100 heuristic searches beginning
from random trees. Support for nodes was established by bootstrapping in RAxML (1000
pseudo-replicates) and Bayesian posterior probabilities in MrBayes v3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck
& Ronquist 2001).#Materials-methods*]
[@Results#Section-header*]

[@The phylogenetic analysis of Rhizophydiales based on combined 18S, 28S,
and 5.8S subunits provides strong support, 77 bootstrap percentage and
0.99 posterior probability, for a sister relationship between H. polyrhiza and
B. dendrobatidis (Fig. 1). These two species group with a strain identiﬁed as
Entophlyctis helioformis (JEL326), and this clade is sister to the other members
of the Rhizophydiales. As seen in previous studies, the phylogenetic distance
between H. polyrhiza and B. dendrobatidis is rather large as suggested by
branch lengths, and the percentage diﬀerence between rRNA sequences of the
two species is ~10%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thallus with three or more widely distributed rhizoidal axes. Multiple, short to
long tubular discharge papillae.
Expanded Description — The generation time for H. polyrhiza on
mPmTG nutrient agar is 2–3 days at 23 °C. In motion, zoospores are spherical
(Fig. 2h, arrowhead) and contain a single lipid globule near the base of the
ﬂagellum (Fig. 2a). They encyst and within 24 h form a thallus with multiple
rhizoidal axes (Fig. 2b). At maturity rhizoids can extend to more than twice
the diameter of the zoosporangium (Fig. 2c); distally rhizoids are ﬁne (<0.5
µm) and isodiametric, but near the thallus they are slightly swollen (Fig. 2d).
Zoosporangia form discharge papillae (Figs. 2e, f) within 52 hr, with the
number of papillae increasing with size of the zoosporangia. Papillae may be
barely raised (Fig. 2f), short tubes (Fig. 2e) or, in crowded conditions, long
tubes (Fig. 2g). Zoospores are elongate when discharged (arrows, Fig. 2h) but
soon become spherical (dia 3.5–4.5 µm with ﬂagellum up to 28 µm).
Ultrastructural characters — The ultrastructure (Figs 3a–e) of
the H. polyrhiza zoospore is nearly identical to Barr’s illustration of a typical
Rhizophydium zoospore (Barr & Hadland-Hartmann 1978). A membranebound aggregation of ribosomes is in the center of the zoospore, outside of
which are the nucleus, a single lobed mitochondrion, and a single lipid globule
(Figs. 3a, b). A lobe of a mitochondrion is often anterior to the kinetosome

(Fig. 3a). The microbody is appressed to the side of the lipid globule toward the
center of the zoospore (Fig. 3b), and a rumposome (= fenestrated cisterna of
Letcher et al. 2004) is appressed to the lipid near the surface of the cell (Fig. 3b).
The non-ﬂagellated centriole is parallel to the kinetosome and joined to it by a
bridge of partly overlapping ﬁbers centrally located between the two structures
(Figs. 3c, d; arrow); the ﬁbrils form a wide (>0.075 µm) zone of convergence. The
non-ﬂagellated centriole is shorter than its width (Figs. 3c, e). A microtubular
root, composed of separate, parallel microtubules, extends from the side of the
kinetosome to the rumposome (Fig. 3e). A terminal plate is in the lumen of

[@Comments — We found this saprobic organism only once, from an oligotrophic,
acidic lake. Based on descriptions of genera of the Chytridiales sensu Sparrow
(1960), it would have been placed in the genus Rhizophlyctis A. Fisch. because
it develops endogenously and has multiple rhizoidal axes. Molecular and
TEM evidence have altered our concept of the importance of morphological
characters (e.g., James et al. 2000, 2006; Mozley-Standridge et al. 2009) and
chytrids with endogenous development and multiple rhizoidal axes occur not
only in the Rhizophlyctidales (Letcher et al. 2008a) but also other orders of the
Chytridiomycetes, now including the Rhizophydiales.#Comments*]
