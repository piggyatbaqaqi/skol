[@Abstract — A new leaf spot disease was observed on the orchid species Epidendrum
secundum in “high altitude grasslands” of Araponga, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Inoculation
tests on healthy plants conﬁrmed the pathogenicity of this fungus. Pseudocercospora epidendri
sp. nov., the causal agent of the leaf spot disease of E. secundum, is described, illustrated, and
compared with allied Pseudocercospora species on hosts of the family Orchidaceae.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Epidendrum secundum is an orchid species with epiphytical or terrestrial
habitat, characteristic of the Brazilian “high altitude grasslands” (Plate 1)
and the Brazilian Cerrado (Caiafa & Silva 2005, Neto et al. 2007). In 2002,
exploratory research was begun with the goal of describing the phytopathogenic
mycodiversity associated with Orchidaceae in the state of Minas Gerais (Pereira
et al. 2002, Pereira & Barreto 2004, Silva & Pereira 2007, 2008, Silva et al. 2008,
Lopes et al. 2009, Pereira & Silva 2009). During an initial botanical survey in
the “high altitude grasslands” of Parque Estadual da Serra do Brigadeiro in
Araponga in Minas Gerais State, Brazil, samples of the orchid E. secundum
with leaf spots caused by a cercosporoid hyphomycete were collected (Plate
2–3). Our morphological characterization showed that the leaf-spotting fungus
represented a new species of Pseudocercospora, which we describe, illustrate,
and discuss below.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods
Samples of infected E. secundum leaves were collected, photographed (SONY
DSC-H9 digital camera), dried in a plant press, and deposited at the herbarium of
Universidade Federal de Viçosa (VIC). Fungal samples were removed from fresh

leaf spots under an Olympus SZX7 stereomicroscope and mounted on glass slides
with lactophenol. Material was also hand sectioned for stromata observation and
measurements. Structures were observed, measured (30 of each structural type), and
illustrated under 400× magniﬁcation using an Olympus BX 50 light microscope ﬁtted
with a drawing tube. To determine pathogenicity, the fungus was isolated directly onto
PDA, brought into pure culture, and grown at 27°C for 20 days. Culture disks taken

from colony borders were used to inoculate four healthy young and mature leaves of
three E. secundum plants. The inoculated plants were maintained in moist chambers for
three days and then transferred to a greenhouse at 25°C and 70–80% humidity. Healthy
leaves, on which only PDA plugs were placed, served as control. This assay was carried
in three replications.#Materials-methods*]

[@Plate 6. Necrotic symptoms on leaves of Epidendrum secundum 8 days after inoculation with
Pseudocercospora epidendri.#Figure*]

[@Leaf spots distinct, scattered over leaves, amphigenous, irregular, pale brown,
delimited by a black margin on abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces, 3–12 mm
diam. Stromata well-developed, immersed, becoming erumpent, brown,
47.5–166 µm wide and 57–213 µm high. Caespituli commonly hypophyllous,
brown. Conidiophores fasciculate, brown, becoming paler towards apex,
unbranched, smooth, 0-2 septate, subcylindrical, straight to curved, arising
from cells of a well-developed stroma, 10–57 × 2–6 µm. Conidiogenous cells
terminal, integrated, pale brown, smooth 3–4.5 × 2–3.5 µm. Conidiogenous
loci inconspicuous, not darkened, unthickened. Conidia solitary, acicular
to obclavate, 11–86 × 1–3 µm, 1–9 septate, straight to curved, pale brown,
smooth, guttulate, base rounded to long obconically truncate hila unthickened,
not darkened.
Cultures on PDA slow growing, 1.5–2.0 cm after 30 days at 27°C, stromatic and
immersed in center, grayish aerial mycelium, black reverse, no sporulation.#Description*]
[@Comments — Dark sunken necrotic symptoms were detected 8 days after
artiﬁcial inoculation on all inoculated leaves, with structures formed 20–30
days after inoculation. Uninoculated control leaves, on which only PDA plugs
were placed, remained healthy. The same fungus was then re-isolated, from
the symptom in the inoculation assay (Plate 6). Thirteen cercosporoid species
are known to occur on orchidaceous hosts: Cercospora angraeci Feuilleaub.

species known to occur on the Orchidaceae (Table 1) and the second known
to occur on Epidendrum (P. odontoglossi was the ﬁrst reported to occur on that
genus.) Pseudocercospora cypripedii and P. odontoglossi can be distinguished
from P. epidendri by their longer and wider conidia (Chupp 1954), while
P. dendrobii produces narrower conidia (Crous & Braun 2003) and P. peristeriae
is diagnosed by superﬁcial hyphae with solitary conidiophores (Meeboon et
al. 2007). Almost all P. epidendri caespituli were hypophyllous but not formed
through stomata, which may indicate an adaptation for the high solar incidence
typical of Brazilian “high altitude grasslands”.#Comments*]
