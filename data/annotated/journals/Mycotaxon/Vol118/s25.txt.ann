[@Abstract—Six species in ﬁve diﬀerent genera of the Rhytismataceae are reported
from Camellia spp. on the Chinese mainland. Among them Lophodermium sinense on
Camellia sinensis is described as a new species, and Terriera camelliae on C. octopetala is
a new combination, while Bifusella camelliae, Coccomyces sinensis, Hypohelion durum, and
Lophodermium jiangnanense are already known for China. This paper provides descriptions
and a key for all these species as well as illustrations for the new species. All examined
specimens are deposited in the Reference Collection of Forest Fungi of Anhui Agricultural
University, China (AAUF).#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Members of Camellia L. (Theaceae) are evergreen shrubs or trees, with a
total of 280 species distributed in bilateral zones of the Tropic of Cancer in
east Asia, including 238 species in southwestern and south China (Zhang &
Ren 1998). Camellias are economically valuable as ornamentals and sources of
beverages, tea oil, and medicine.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Of the 1072 fungal species known to inhabit Camellia worldwide, only
10 belong in the Rhytismataceae (Farr & Rossman 2011). Cryptomyces theae
Sawada, the ﬁrst rhytismataceous species recorded on C. sinensis (L.) Kuntze,
was described from Taiwan by Sawada (1919) and later found on the same
host in Japan (Hara 1936). Minter (1982) reported Lophodermium camelliicola
Minter on C. sinensis from India. Kobayashi (2007) recorded L. hysterioides

[@220 ... Chen & al.#Page-header*]
(Pers.) Sacc. (= L. foliicola (Fr.) P.F. Cannon & Minter) and two Coccomyces
species on C. japonica L. in Japan. Up to now, ﬁve species of Rhytismataceae
have been described on Camellia from mainland China (Teng 1933; Hou 2000;
Lin et al. 2001a, 2004a,b). These fungi are mostly plant pathogens leading to
diﬀerent degrees of economic loss. Lophodermium jiangnanense can cause a
leaf cast of C. oleifera C. Abel (Lin et al. 2004a), while Bifusella camelliae and
Hypohelion durum on C. sinensis can cause serious branch rot (Hou 2000, Lin
et al. 2004b). The present study, based on specimens collected by the authors,
reports one hitherto undescribed species, makes one new combination,
and discusses the four other species known on Camellia from the Chinese
mainland. These records may not be complete, as more rhytismataceous species
on camellias can be expected in this region.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Macroscopic appearance was described from observations made under the dissecting
microscope at 10−50 × magniﬁcation. Reference collection material was rehydrated in
water for 15 min, and 10–15 µm thick sections of the fruit bodies were cut using a
freezing microtome. For the observations of outlines of ascomata and conidiomata in
vertical section, sections were mounted in lactic acid or cotton blue with pretreatment
in water. The color of the various structures and of ascospore contents was observed in
water. Gelatinous sheaths surrounding ascospores and paraphyses were examined in
water or 0.1% (w/v) cotton blue in lactic acid. Measurements were made using material
mounted in 5% KOH or Melzer’s reagent and from 30 asci, ascospores, and paraphyses
for each specimen. Line and point integrated illustrations of external shapes and internal
structures of fruit bodies were drawn using a microscopic drawing tube (Panasonic
XSJ-2, Japan).#Materials-methods*]

[@Comments—Bifusella tsugae H.S. Cao & C.L. Hou, closely related to B. camelliae,
diﬀers in having ascospores with a wider isthmus, paraphyses not swollen at
the apex, absence of zone lines, and occurrence on needles of Tsuga chinensis
(Franch.) E. Pritz. (Cao et al. 1996, as T. tchekiangensis).
Bifusella camelliae can cause a serious branch rot of the tea plant in regions
where the specimens were collected, the damage of branch tips exceeding 85%
in the tea garden where the disease occurs. It may therefore pose a threat to the
tea-growing industry. According to our observations, this fungus infects new
twigs, gradually causing brown to grey-yellow lesions where conidiomata and
ascomata are successively produced. Between May and June of the second year,
ascomata mature to discharge ascospores, leading to the next infection.#Comments*]

[@Comments—Coccomyces sinensis is common on camellias in southern
China and was also found recently on fallen leaves of Camellia cf. japonica
in Taiwan (Kirschner et al. 2009). It is very similar in the shape of its
paraphyses (subfusoid-ventricose and pointed apices) to C. mucronatus Korf &
W.Y. Zhuang on Fagaceae, which diﬀers in polygonal to subcircular ascomata,
much narrower asci (4.3−5 µm) and ascospores (0.6−0.8 µm), dense
periphysoids, and paraphyses lacking refractive solid gel at the apex (Korf &
Zhuang 1985). Coccomyces urceoloides Spooner, which also somewhat resembles
C. sinensis in paraphyses capped with a mass of subhyaline or yellowish solid
gel and measuring 6−12 × 5−8 µm, diﬀers in other aspects (Spooner 1990).#Comments*]

typical features of the genus except for the presence of basal stroma and yet is
far from genera such as Hypoderma De Not. Hypohelion scirpinum (DC.) P.R.

[@Comments—Lophodermium sinense is very similar to L. jiangnanense on
the same plant genus, but the latter has larger subepidermal ascomata and
conidiomata, unbranched paraphyses, a covering stroma comprising aliform
and elongate cells, and a well developed basal stroma with hyaline reticulate
tissue in the corner between the covering and basal stroma (Lin et al. 2004a).
Lophodermium intricatum is also similar to the new species but diﬀers in its
much larger ascomata, asci, and ascospores, asci with truncate-conical apices,
ascospores with a median septum and without a gelatinous sheath, and the
presence of zone lines (Spooner 1991). Lophodermium implicatum Y.R. Lin
& Z.S. Xu diﬀers in possessing intraepidermal ascomata associated with dark
brown zone lines, shorter ascospores, and intraepidermal conidiomata with
trichogynes (Lin et al. 2001b).
Lophodermium sinense is a pathogen causing leaf spot. The fungus at ﬁrst
probably develops within the living leaves but visible symptoms do not show,
after which the anamorphic and teleomorphic fruit bodies sequentially appear
on brown lesions of infected leaves as the vitality of the host declines. Diseased
leaves become reddish-brown and fall between July and August. Mature
ascomata have been observed only on fallen leaves.#Comments*]

obvious structure. Conidia 2.5−4 × ca 0.8 μm, cylindrical, hyaline, aseptate.
Ascomata in similar positions to conidiomata on the substratum, scattered
to crowded in grey-yellow, subcircular to irregular bleached spots. In surface
view ascomata 440−870(−1020) × 290−490 µm, elliptical or occasionally 3lobed, black-brown to black, slightly shiny, edge deﬁned, moderately raising
the substratum surface, opening by a longitudinal split about 4/5-7/8 the length
of the ascoma, which is sometimes branched. Lips absent. In median vertical
section ascomata subepidermal. Covering stroma 15−22 µm thick near the
opening, slightly thinner towards the edge, extending to the basal stroma,
composed of black-brown, thick-walled angular cells 3−5 µm diam. Along the
edge of the ascomatal opening is a 10−15 µm thick, ﬂattened extension to the
covering stroma which covers the hymenium, and which comprises markedly
black and brittle carbonized tissue with no obvious cellular structure. Basal
stroma composed of 1−2 layers of black-brown, thick-walled, angular to
globular cells. Subhymenium 12−18 µm thick, consisting of textura porrecta.
Paraphyses extending 15−30 µm beyond the asci, ca 2 µm wide, ﬁliform,
sometimes gradually swollen to 2.5−3 µm or branched above, septate. Asci
ripening sequentially, 85−120 × 5.5−6.5 µm, cylindrical, short-stalked, rounded
at the apex, J–, 8-spored. Ascospores arranged fasciculately or somewhat
helically, 52−80 × 1−1.2 µm, ﬁliform, hyaline, aseptate, covered by a ca 0.5 µm
thick gelatinous sheath.#Description*]
[@Host species, habitat, and distribution: Camellia octopetala Hu,
Camellia sp. (Teng 1933); conidiomata and ascomata were found on fallen
leaves. Known only from Fujian Province, China.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Comments—Taxonomic placement of Terrea camelliae has long been
controversial. Teng (1933) originally validly published the fungus as L.
camelliae. Tehon (1939), who examined part of the type (labeled “co-type”
by Teng), felt that it lacked structures characteristic of the Hypodermataceae

[@Rhytismataceae on Camellia (China) ... 229#Page-header*]

(= Rhytismataceae) and transferred it to Clithris (Fr.) Bonord. (= Cenangium
Fr.) in the Helotiaceae Rehm (Kirk et al. 2008). Teng’s later (1963) transfer of
the taxon to Colpoma Wallr. cannot be accepted because Colpoma ascomata
develop on bark (not leaves) and have a well-developed basal stroma.
Eriksson (1970) erected the new genus Terriera B. Erikss. based on the type
species T. cladophila (Lév.) B. Erikss. on Vaccinium myrtillus L. Johnston (2001)
and Ortiz-García et al. (2003) transferred several species to Terriera, including
Clithris arundinacea Penz. & Sacc., C. minor Tehon, Lophodermium fuegianum
Speg., L. javanicum Penz. & Sacc., and L. sacchari Lyon. Terriera diﬀers from
Lophodermium Chevall. by the markedly black and brittle extensions of the
covering stroma and by the thin-walled, prismatic or angular cells in the corner
between the covering and basal stroma. The present species on Camellia sp. and
C. octopetala ﬁts closely the characters of Terriera based on the illustration by
Tehon (1939) and examinations carried out by the authors. Consequently, we
redispose it as T. camelliae.
There are some signs that T. camelliae may be a pathogen associated with
leaf cast of eight-petaled Camellia species.#Comments*]
