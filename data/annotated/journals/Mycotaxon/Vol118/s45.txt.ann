[@Field investigation of the Ascomycetes of Sicily occurring on decaying

species, described here as Hypoderma siculum.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Collections of the new species were made between 2007 and 2010 at an elevation
of 700 m a.s.l. in southeast Sicily. Morphological and microscopic examinations were
carried out on fresh material and on dried specimens rehydrated in water. Observations
and measurements were made in water and Melzer’s reagent. Ascus and ascospore size
ranges from the holotype were based on 50 measurements, using an Optika optical
microscope (model BK 1301), with 40× or 100× (oil immersion) objectives. All voucher
specimens were deposited in the fungarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew K(M)
and in the fungal reference collection of Landcare Research in New Zealand (PDD).
DNA was extracted separately from two sets of four fruiting bodies taken from
each of two separate blackened areas on leaf pieces within the isotype specimen (PDD
99894), using REDExtract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kits (Sigma, USA). The perithecia were

ground in extraction buﬀer with a plastic pestle in the Eppendorf tube. Following this,
DNA extraction and PCR were carried out following manufacturer’s instructions. ITS
sequences were obtained from each extract following the methods of Johnston & Park
(2005).

[@Hypoderma siculum sp. nov. (Italy) ... 395#Page-header*]

Using ClustalW (Thompson et al. 1994), our newly generated sequences were
aligned with sequences deposited in Genbank as Hypoderma rubi or those that closely
matched H. rubi. Because of the paucity of available data, ITS sequences were generated
from several additional Hypoderma spp. from New Zealand, with DNA extracted from
cultures grown from germinating ascospores. Other taxa included in the analysis were
members Lophodermium eucalypti/Coccomyces tumidus clade recognized by Lantz et al.
(2011) that formed a sister relationship to the core Hypoderma clade, and Lophodermium
agathidis as the outgroup.
The taxa included are listed in Table 1, along with the Genbank accession numbers
of our newly generated sequences. A Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed
using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003)
with gaps treated as missing data, using the K80+I+G model which was selected using
the AIC method in MrModelTest 2.3 (Nylander 2004). The data set was run with 2 chains
for 10 million generations, trees sampled every 1000 generations with a burn-in of 25%.
Bayesian posterior probabilities were obtained from 50% majority rule consensus trees.#Materials-methods*]

[@Hypoderma siculum falls within the Hypoderma sensu stricto clade of Lantz
et al. (2011). Genetic relations within this clade are poorly resolved in the ITS
gene tree (Fig. 3). Despite this, H. siculum is genetically distinct from other
named isolates within the clade, and this genetic isolation and its distinct

biology supports recognizing the fungus as an independent species. Other
morphologically distinct taxa within this clade, such as Hypoderma cordylines,
are also poorly resolved. More intensive, multi-gene phylogenies of Australasian
species have shown that ITS alone does not adequately resolve relationships
within this clade (unpublished data). The weak quality of the DNA extracted
from the H. siculum dried specimens did not permit reliable sequencing of
single copy genes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ferula communis L. (Apiaceae), a typical herbaceous plant of the
Mediterranean area, is commonly associated with two Hypoderma species,
H. ferulae Lantieri (Lantieri 2009) and H. siculum. Early reports of Hypoderma
rubi (Pers.) DC. and H. commune (Fr.) Duby on F. communis (Duby 1862;
Petrak 1943) are diﬃcult to assess, as neither report is supported by specimens.
It is uncertain in what sense the authors were using these names and impossible
to check whether the specimens they reported match our Ferula-specialised
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@400 ... Lantieri & al.#Page-header*]
[@Extensive collecting in Sicily revealed only H. ferulae and H. siculum on
Ferula. Scalia (1900: 37) reported H. commune from Sicily on a species in another
genus of Apiaceae, Thapsia garganica L.; the report included no description of
the fungus, and again there is no material available to verify the record. There
is no evidence from collections made in Sicily that H. siculum occurs on other
genera of Apiaceae (unpubl. data).#Comments*]
[@Hypoderma siculum is distinguished from H. ferulae by ascospore size and
septation (21–24 × 2.5−3 µm and often 1−septate in H. ferulae), by the presence
of an extended area of stromatic subcuticular tissue surrounding the ascomata,
the colour of the hymenium when fresh (yellow-honey with greenish tinges in
H. ferulae), and the lack of an excipular layer.#Comments*]
[@Hypoderma siculum resembles H. rubi morphologically, but as noted in
the phylogenetic section, the application of this name by diﬀerent authors is
uncertain, and genetic relationships amongst specimens identiﬁed as H. rubi
are poorly resolved. Hypoderma rubi sensu Powell (1974), Johnston (1990), and
Medardi (2006) diﬀers slightly from H. siculum in its ascospore size (20−25(−26.5)
× 3−4 µm) and the fusiform-navicular ascospore shape. Hypoderma commune
diﬀers in having ascomata with yellow-greenish hymenium and smaller, nonseptate spores (17−20 × 3−4 µm; Ellis & Ellis 1988).#Comments*]
