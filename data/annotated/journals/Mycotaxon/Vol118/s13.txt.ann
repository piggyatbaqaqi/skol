[@Abstract — “Peziza udicola”, P. crassipes Quél., and P. paludicola are shown to be conspeciﬁc,
with P. paludicola as the correct name for the species. Peziza crassipes var. kilimanjarensis is
recombined as a variety of P. paludicola.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@During preparation of a monograph on Peziza Fr. —to be published by
the Bresadola Mycological Association (AMB, Trento, Italy)— the name
Peziza udicola Svrček aroused our attention. This name appears only in some
identiﬁcation keys (Hohmeyer et al. 1989, Spooner 2001), generally as a short
observation without reference to year and place of publication and sometimes
also without author. No information about its date and place of publication was
available from the Index of Fungi, IndexFungorum (www.indexfungorum.
org), or MycoBank (www.mycobank.org).#Misc-exposition*]
[@A loan request for the holotype from the mycological collections of the
National Museum of Prague (PRM), where Svrček’s specimens are located, was
met with the response that there were no specimens or data relating to this
name.#Misc-exposition*]
[@It was moreover necessary to verify the possible conspeciﬁcity of “P. udicola”
with Aleuria paludicola Boud. (assumed by Schmid-Heckel 1990) and also with
Peziza crassipes Quél. (reported by Svrček 1970).#Misc-exposition*]
Svrček (1970) provided a detailed description of P. crassipes Quél. (free
translation from German):

[@114 ... Cacialli, Lantieri & Medardi#Page-header*]
[@...Hymenial surface 250−300 µm tall, tending to brown. Hypothecium narrow, not
distinctly delimited from the medulla. Asci 250−300 × 14−22 µm, 8-spored, with
apical ring strongly amyloid... Spores (19−)22−24(–25) × (10–)10.5−12.5(−13.5)
µm, mostly 21−23 × 11−12 µm, long elliptical to cylindrical-elliptical, round to
sharpened at both extremities, homogeneous content, often pale yellow-brown,
totally smooth...on decaying twigs, herbaceous stems, completely rotten wood,
debris, sometimes on necrotic herbs or directly on bare ground, in humid to
swampy places, river banks and near springs, particularly under large herbaceous
plants (e.g. Petasites, Chamaenerion angustifolium)....#Description*]

[@Svrček (1970) also reported:
…I cannot exclude the possibility that Aleuria paludicola Boudier (1907) and
Peziza crassipes are conspeciﬁc. Boudier’s original diagnosis states that this Aleuria
has saucer-shaped apothecia, spores 23−26 × 12−15 µm and exceptionally wide
paraphyses (18−22 µm). Up to now it has been collected by the author only once,
on marsh stems in a swamp. Maybe it is an abnormal form of Peziza crassipes...
Moser (1963) mistakes the two species and unintentionally uses the epithet
“palustris” for Boudier’s “paludicola.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1970, therefore, Svrček did not make any mention of the earlier homonym,
Peziza crassipes Wallr. (Wallroth 1833), an inoperculate ascomycete. This
earlier homonym makes P. crassipes Quél. a nom. illegit. Eleven years later
in a checklist of Czech discomycetes, Svrček (1981) listed his 1970 records of
P. crassipes Quél. under a newly coined name “P. udicola,” noting that there was
an earlier homonym of Quélet’s binomial and referring to the description and
illustration in his previous publication: “Svr. 1970: 63 (c. ﬁg.) (Peziza crassipes
Quél., non Wallroth)”. The name “P. udicola” was apparently intended as a
potential nom. nov. for the illegitimate Quélet binomial, but Svrček failed to
meet the requirements for valid publication when he made no full and direct
reference to the place of publication of the replaced synonym. As a potential
sp. nov., it was also not validly published because of the absence of any Latin
description or reference to a previously published Latin description (McNeill
et al. 2006: Art. 36.1); it may even be argued that it is a nom. nud. (McNeill
et al. 2006: Art. 32.1(d)) despite the direct reference to the previous German
description (Svrček 1970) and the indirect reference to the original French
description (Quélet 1883).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Specimen loans of the holotype, isotype, or other relevant collections of
P. crassipes and Aleuria paludicola were requested from the fungal collections of
the National Museum of Natural History, Paris (PC) but none were found. We
have therefore only been able to compare published information.
Table 1 summarizes what each cited author wrote about the three names.
Brummelen (1969) noted that microscopic dimensions given by Boudier
(1907, 1904–10) contain an error and need to be decreased by 10%. This was
taken into account when analysing the spore sizes of A. paludicola reported by#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boudier. The corrected dimensions of the spores in question here are 20.7−23.4
× 10.8−13.5 µm. Comparing these data with those obtained from our analyses
on “P. udicola” makes clear that the various characteristics are very similar and
that small diﬀerences may be considered physiological variations of diﬀerent
individuals. We believe they are not enough to justify treating the names as
separate species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Macro- and microscopic examinations were carried out on both fresh and dried
specimens (rehydrated in water or KOH 5%), with water as a mounting medium and
Melzer’s reagent to observe the iodine reaction of the asci, using an Optika optical
microscope (BK 1301 model), with 40× or 100× (immersion oil) objectives. Spore
dimensions were obtained by measuring of 50 mature spores. Collections were placed
in the fungal reference collection of L’Aquila (HMA), the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
K(M), and the private herbaria collections of F. Padovan (FP) and G. Medardi (GM).#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Peziza paludicola can be distinguished from similar species by the following
characteristics: apothecia with monotonous colours; the outside showing a
dark granulation more evident at the margin; smooth and relatively large
spores; habitat generally related to decaying deciduous wood. Similar species
are Peziza boudieri (Cooke) Donadini, Peziza hortensis P. Crouan & H. Crouan,
and Peziza sciophila Medardi. These can be diﬀerentiated by the anatomy of the
excipular tissues and by the habitat. Peziza ampliata Pers. is distinctive in both
the excipular architecture and the position of the layers and the dimensions
of the cells; the substratum is also at times important to separate these fungi.
Table 2 summarizes the main characteristics of these species.#Comments*]
