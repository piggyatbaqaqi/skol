[@Abstract — Mycena guldeniana (section Polyadelphia) is proposed for an agaric found in
alpine areas of south Norway that is here described, illustrated and compared with other
species of the section. The new species grows on fallen, decaying leaves under Salix spp. or
occasionally on small twigs in the same habitat and is characterized by its small size, greyish
brown pileus, 4-spored basidia, smooth cheilocystidia, prominent, wide terminal cells of
the pileipellis hyphae, and clamp connections. Phylogenetic analyses of nucLSU support the
taxon within Mycena and genetically distinct from the morphologically similar M. terena.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@During a stay at ‘Finse Research Centre’ in south Norway, August 2005, the
ﬁrst author collected and studied several Mycena species. The research centre
is situated at approximately 60°30ʹN on the mountain plateau Hardangervidda
1200 m above sea level. The area lies entirely within the alpine zone and is
devoid of trees but in parts is covered with Salix shrubs. The research led to the
proposal of two new Mycena species (Aronsen & Gulden 2007). Two collections
were also made of a small Mycena that initially was misinterpreted as M. terena
Aronsen & Maas Geest., a species found on fallen, decaying leaves of Salix caprea
in the coastal area of South Norway (Aronsen & Maas Geesteranus 1992).
In 2008 the ‘Finse research centre’ was visited again, and the main
investigation was done on the south-facing slope at Nordnut at approximately
1400 m. The slope is formed by basic, phyllitic rocks intermixed with Salix shrubs
and some calcicolous vegetation (Gulden & Jenssen 1982). On small, partially
buried twigs on the ground under the Salix shrubs a tiny Mycena species was
collected. Further investigation showed that not only was it identical with the
taxon found in 2005, it clearly diﬀered from M. terena and did not match any
other known species of Mycena.#Misc-exposition*]

[@188 ... Aronsen & Perry#Page-header*]
[@The same year this taxon was also collected at the base of the mountain
Gaustatoppen at approximately 59°51ʹN at approximately 1150 m. Gaustatoppen
(1883 m) is the peak of a 7 km long mountain spine consisting of quarzite,
and in the lower slopes there are areas with dense Salix shrubs. In these Salix
shrubs the unknown taxon was found in great numbers together with M. exilis
Aronsen & Gulden. The taxon is herein proposed as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
The description is based on six collections from two diﬀerent years and two diﬀerent
localities including specimens in all stages of age. Preliminary observations and photos
were made in daylight in the ﬁeld, while more thorough observations and descriptions
were made the same day in lamp light in the laboratory of the research centre. The dried
material was rehydrated in 2% KOH and examined in ammoniated Congo Red and
Melzer’s reagent using a Nikon light microscope with high resolution, 100x oil objective.
For each collection 30 spores were measured. The spore length and width ratios (q) were
calculated and the average quotient value (qav) is given in the description. Measurements
and drawings were made of basidia, spores, cheilocystidia, pileipellis hyphae, and the
stipe cortical layer. Melzer’s reagent was used to check amyloidity of spore walls and
colour reactions in the lamellar trama. Authors abbreviations follow Index Fungorum
(2011), and the collections are deposited in the university museum of Oslo (O).
To assess the phylogenetic position of M. guldeniana within Mycena, and the
relationship of this taxon to the morphologically similar M. terena, sequences of the
5ʹ end of the nuclear large ribosomal subunit gene (nucLSU) spanning domains D1
and D2 were analyzed within a broader sampling of taxa representative of Mycena and
the tricholomatoid clade sensu Matheny et al. (2006). Two members of Boletales were
included as outgroup taxa for rooting purposes. Genomic DNA was extracted from
dried basidiomes representing each taxon (Table 1) using the E.Z.N.A. Forensic DNA
Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. PCR protocols
followed Perry & Pﬁster (2007) using primers LROR and LR5 (Moncalvo et al. 2007).
Ampliﬁed DNA was cleaned with ExoSAP-IT (USB Molecular Biology Reagents and
Biochemical, U.S.A.) and sent to Elim Biopharmaceuticals (http://www.elimbiopharm.
com/) for cycle sequencing and visualization on an ABI 3700 capillary sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, U.S.A.) using the same primers as above. Sequences were edited
and assembled using Sequencher 4.0 (Gene Codes Corp., U.S.A.). The resulting data
matrix was aligned manually with MacClade 4 (Maddison & Maddison, 2000). Edited
sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Table 1), and the aligned dataset is
available via TreeBase (www.treebase.org; S11538).
Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were conducted in PAUP* version 4 (Swoﬀord
2003) and employed an iterative approach. Starting trees were built via the Neighbor
Joining method and used to estimate parameters of the model of sequence evolution.
Estimated parameter values were then ﬁxed, and a ML search was conducted. Resulting
topologies were then used to re-estimate and ﬁx parameter values. This process was
repeated for a total of three iterations to insure the analyses had converged on the most
likely topology. Clade support was assessed by non-parametric, maximum likelihood

consisted of 1000 replicates with all parameter values estimated by the program. All
analyses were performed under a GTR+I+G model of sequence evolution as determined
using the Akaike Information Criterion in MrModelTest 2.3 (Nylander 2004). Bayesian

analyses were performed using Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMCMC) methods as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist
2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) using the same model as the ML analyses. Analyses
consisted of two parallel searches, run for 3 million generations and initiated with
random starting trees. Chains were sampled every 300 generations for a total of 10,000
trees per search, sampled from the posterior distribution. Trees sampled prior to the
analysis reaching a split deviation frequency of 0.02 were discarded as the burn-in, while
the remaining trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities of the individual
clades. Default settings in MrBayes were used to set the incremental heating scheme,
chain number, unconstrained branch lengths and uninformative topology priors.#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@Mycena guldeniana belongs to section Polyadelphia Singer ex Maas Geest.
(Maas Geesteranus 1986) based on its small size, adnate lamellae, pileipellis
and stipitipellis hyphae densely covered with short cylindrical excrescences,
absence of pleurocystidia, and occurrence on decaying leaves. The species of
this section usually possess cheilocystidia that are densely covered with short,
cylindrical excrescences, but Aronsen & Maas Geesteranus (1992) described the
new species M. terena with smooth cheilocystidia. Another species in the same
section known to have more or less smooth cheilocystidia is M. querciphila
Esteve-Rav. & M. Villarreal (Esteve-Raventós & Villarreal 1997).
The smooth cheilocystidia of M. guldeniana suggest a close relationship
with both M. terena and M. querciphila, with M. terena seeming the most
similar. Mycena querciphila diﬀers in the pale olive-yellow to olive-brown
colours of pileus, lamellae, and stipe and in having some cheilocystidia
sparsely diverticulate by warts or short cylindrical excrescences. Additionally,
M. querciphila is typically found growing on fallen, decaying leaves of Quercus
ilex subsp. ballota. Mycena terena, recorded on fallen decaying Salix caprea
leaves in two coastal lowland localities in South Norway, has a pale beige or
very pale grey pileus that soon turns white, a black stipe apex (when young),
somewhat narrower spores, and pileipellis hyphae that lack prominent terminal
cells. The diﬀerences are shown in Table 2 below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On 11 Aug. 1979, Gulden & Jenssen (1982) reported an unknown species of
Mycena, collected at Finse, Nordnut, on a dead leaf. Although their material was
‘too scanty for a formal description of a new species,’ the description indicates
that their unknown species was identical with M. guldeniana.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nucLSU dataset comprises 887 aligned positions for 26 ingroup taxa
and contains 131 parsimony informative characters. Maximum likelihood
analyses converged on a common topology, with each iteration producing trees
that did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly in their likelihood values. The ﬁnal ML tree
recovered is shown in Figure 7 (–lnL = 3527.88466). Bayesian analyses reached
a split deviation frequency below 0.02 after approximately 880,000 generations,
and the ﬁrst 2930 trees sampled were discarded as the burn-in. All Mycena
sequences included in the analyses form a well-supported (ML bootstrap = 100,
posterior probability = 1.0) lineage, sister to the remaining taxa sampled from
the tricholomatoid clade. Although relationships within the Mycena lineage
are not resolved with signiﬁcant support, M. guldeniana and M. terena are

the relationship between these taxa is not well supported by ML bootstrap or
bayesian posterior probabilities, these results do support our recognition of
M. terena and M. guldeniana as distinct phylogenetic species. While these two
taxa are very similar morphologically, the nucLSU data indicate that genetically
they are as distinct from one another as are the majority of other closely related
Mycena species included in our analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
