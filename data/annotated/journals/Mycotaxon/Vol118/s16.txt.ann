[@Abstract — Some interesting fungi were collected during recent expeditions to Atlantic
Forest fragments. Entoloma aripoanum is recorded for the ﬁrst time from Brazil. Crepidotus
ﬂavus, E. tucuchense, and Lepiota erinana are new records from Brazil’s northeast region,
and Trogia cantharelloides is new from Pernambuco State. Drawings and descriptions of the
species are provided.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The Atlantic Forest, which is a priority area for conservation (Myers et al.
2000), has been drastically diminished by human activity since the beginning
of Portuguese colonization (Kimmel et al. 2008, Trindade et al. 2008). Only
11–16% remains of the original forest (Ribeiro et al 2009). Research on fungal
diversity is urgently needed in this threatened biome.
In this continuation of previous reports on agarics from Atlantic Forest
fragments of Pernambuco (Wartchow 2006, Wartchow & Maia 2007, Wartchow
et al. 2007a,b, 2008a,b), we present new records of Crepidotus (Fr.) Staude,
Entoloma (Fr.) P. Kumm., Lepiota (Pers.) Gray, and Trogia Fr.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods
Collections were undertaken at the Usina São José (7°50ʹ20ʺS 35°00ʹ10ʺW), an area
covered by variously sized (12–380 ha) Atlantic Forest fragments among sugar cane
ﬁelds (Alves-Araújo et al. 2008, Trindade et al. 2008). These preserved fragments shelter
650 species (379 genera, 105 families) of trees, with Fabaceae, Poaceae, Cyperaceae,

[@138 ... Wartchow, Maia & Cavalcanti#Page-header*]
Asteraceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae, Rubiaceae, Melastomataceae, Araceae, Malvaceae,
Apocynaceae, Sapindaceae, and Sapotaceae as the most diverse (Alves-Araújo et al.
2008).
The usual methodology for studying agarics was followed (Singer 1986). Color codes
and names follow Maerz & Paul (1950; ‘M&P’); x = average dimension. Exsiccates are
deposited at URM Herbarium (Thiers 2011).#Materials-methods*]

[@Pileus 5–14 mm, uniformly sulfur yellow (M&P 10J1 “Sulphur Y, Citrus”),

context thin, ﬂeshy, cream to pale yellow, unchanging. Lamellae radiating
from an attachment point, narrow (<0.5 mm broad) concolorous with pileus,

[@Habitat: gregarious on rotten wood in a fragment of tropical rain forest.#Habitat-distribution*]
[@Material examined: BRAZIL. Pernambuco, Igarassu, Usina São José (“Mata de
Piedade”), 25.viii.2005, F. Wartchow s.n. (URM 80088); Moreno, v.2008, RPPN Garnijó,

[@Note: The macroscopic features were noted from both collections; microscopic
characters were taken almost entirely from URM 80088, except for observations of
cheilocystidia in URM 80089.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: This C. ﬂavus collection is characterized by small, sulfur yellow
basidiomes with slightly tomentose to smooth pilei, globose to occasionally
subglobose basidiospores, clamped hyphae, exclusively 2-spored basidia,
and absence of “antler-like” cheilocystidia (Capelari 2011). The last feature
is consistent in the current collections as well as in material from São Paulo
(Capelari 2011). All features ﬁt with the species concepts given by Senn-Irlet &
Immerzeel (2003) for this group.
In the protologue of C. ﬂavus, Capelari (2011) tried to segregate this species
from C. sulphurinus Imazeki & Toki, described from Japan, based on the twospored basidia described for C. sulphurinus, although apparently no basidia

had been found in the original collection of C. ﬂavus. According to Imazeki &
Toki (1954), C. sulphurinus is a disjunct taxon that diﬀers in the less globose
basidiospores and somewhat clavate cheilocystidia. On the other hand, our
materials agree with the protologue of the São Paulo material in the yellowish
pileus and utriform/lageniform cheilocystidia (which Capelari interpreted as
ventricose), although larger basidiospores (8.7 × 8.7 µm) were reported in the
São Paulo material. Hongo (1961), who described C. sulphurinus specimens
from Japan, referred to the cystidia as broadly clavate and ventricose, but
the basidiospores as subglobose to globose (7.5–9 × 6.5–7.5 µm). Senn-Irlet
& Immerzel (2003), however, reported utriform cystidia for other Japanese
materials.
Another allied species is C. citrinus Petch from Sri Lanka. A type study
by Pegler (1986) referred to clavate cylindric and often constricted cystidia,
and apparently exclusively 4-spored basidia. Earlier, Singer (1973) reported
C. citrinus as growing in montane subtropical forest in Argentina; he did
mention the type from Sri Lanka but did not describe it. The Argentinean
material and our C. ﬂavus collection have a similar spore size (6.8–8.3 µm)
but diﬀer in the clavate to versiform cheilocystidia with frequent projections
(“antler-like” in Senn-Irlet & Immerzeel 2003) and the 2–4-spored. Although
Pegler (1986) did not report “antler-like” cystidia in the type and Pilát (1950)

[@140 ... Wartchow, Maia & Cavalcanti#Page-header*]
had not referred to that feature, Senn-Irlet & Immerzeel (2003), who studied
C. citrinus collections distant from the type locality (La Réunion and Puerto
Rico), observed this feature. Special attention must be given to de Meijer (2008:
321), who reported rare antler-like cystidia in a Paraná collection of C. citrinus
(he described them as having a “contorted apical appendage”). We follow the
Senn-Irlet & Immerzeel (2003) species concept of this group and agree with
Capelari (2011): we regard C. ﬂavus as distinct from —but very similar to—
C. citrinus and C. sulphurinus mainly by the cystidial shape. Morphological,
phylogeographical, and molecular studies on a worldwide scale are necessary
to elucidate whether or not all of these yellow species are diﬀerent.
Crepidotus brunswickianus Speg. is another South American yellow species
closely related to C. ﬂavus. It was ﬁrst described from Southern Argentinean
forests by Spegazzini (1887) with a “pallide melleus” to “fulvo lutescens” pileus,
concolorous lamellae, and basidiospores measuring 5–6 × 3–4 µm. It was
later described from a montane zone in Venezuela as having cadmium yellow
basidiomata, larger (7–8.5 × 6–7 µm) subglobose basidiospores, and vesicular
to clavate cheilocystidia (Dennis 1961, 1970). Despite the close similarities
in the descriptions, we believe that C. brunswickianus and C. ﬂavus represent
distinct species, although a revision is needed for the material identiﬁed in
Dennis (1961).
Pereira (1990), Pegler (1997), Senn-Irlet & de Meijer (1998), de Meijer (2006,
2008) and Capelari (2007, 2011) reported several species of Crepidotus, and
now we have the opportunity to record C. ﬂavus for the ﬁrst time in Northeast
Brazil.#Comments*]

with slightly depressed pileus centre, adnate to short decurrent lamellae,
lignicolous habit, basidiospore size and shape, and clavate cheilocystidia (Baroni

our collection are slightly shorter than those in the Trinidad type as revised by
Baroni & Lodge (1998), who reported cystidia 46–110 µm long, but the other
features agree with the original description. Baroni & Lodge (1998) suggest
that A. aripoana sensu Pegler (1983) represents a distinct species, based on
the number of spore facets (8–10 in Pegler’s Antillean specimen versus 6–8 in
E. aripoanum). Entoloma aripoanum is known from Trinidad (Dennis 1953,
Horak 1977), possibly also from Martinique and Dominica (Pegler 1983; but
see Baroni & Lodge 1998), and now is reported for the ﬁrst time from Brazil.#Comments*]

[@Remarks: This species and Calliderma ﬁbulatum Karstedt & Capelari,
C. rimosum Karstedt & Capelari, C. caeruleosplendens Largent et al., Entoloma
foldatsii (Dennis) E. Horak, and E. pruinatocutis E. Horak are all characterized
by a granulose (rimose in this case) pileus and distinctly hymeniform pileipellis,
a very infrequent feature in Entoloma sensu lato (Horak 1977, Aime et al. 2010,
Karstedt & Capelari 2010). Except for the lack of cystidioid projections in the
type specimen, other features (i.e. radially sulcate pileus, basidiospore size)
our material matches the type as analyzed by Horak (1977), Pegler [1983, as
Inopilus tucuchensis (Dennis) Pegler], and Karstedt & Capelari (2010).
The recently described Calliderma rimosum, the most macroscopically
similar taxon, diﬀers from E. tucuchense in a pileus that cracks more strongly
with age, a revolute pileal margin, sinuate (not adnate) lamellae, and cylindric,
clavate to ventricose cheilocystidia (Karstedt & Capelari 2010).
Entoloma tucuchense, previously known from Trinidad (Dennis 1953) and
Amazonas State, Brazil (Horak 1982), is newly reported from Pernambuco
State, northeast Brazil.
Recent studies place E. tucuchense and other taxa with hymeniform pileipelli
in Calliderma (Romagn.) Largent (Aime et al. 2010, Karstedt & Capelari 2010).
However, other recent molecular studies support Calliderma as an integral part
of a monophyletic Entoloma (Co-David et al. 2009).#Comments*]
