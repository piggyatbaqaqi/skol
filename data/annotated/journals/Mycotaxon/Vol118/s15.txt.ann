[@Abstract — Gemmaspora lecanorae and Rosellinula haplospora are newly reported for
Uzbekistan (Asia), Rosellinula frustulosae for Kyrgyzstan (Asia), and Muellerella ventosicola
and Weddellomyces heterochrous for Ukraine (Europe). The diﬀerent ascospore sizes reported
for W. heterochrous are also brieﬂy discussed.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@More than 1500 species of lichenicolous fungi had been described by
2003 (Lawrey & Diederich 2003), and 3000–4000 are estimated worldwide
(Hawksworth 2001). Lichenicolous fungi have been one of the least explored
fungi because of the inadequate literature and a confused taxonomy based
largely on nineteenth century concepts (Hawksworth 1983). But with the recent
publication of new keys (Foucard 2001, Nash et al. 2004, Halıcı 2008, Ihlen
& Wedin 2008) and checklists (e.g. Kocourková 2000, Diederich & Sérusiaux
2000, Scholz 2000, Faltynowicz 2003, Hawksworth 2003), these organisms have
started to receive more attention. Here, we report new records of lichenicolous
fungi for Ukraine (Europe) and Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan (Asia).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Section-header*]
[@Specimens reported are deposited in KW (Kyiv, Ukraine) or KHER (Kherson,
Ukraine). Specimens were examined with a Leica DM 1000 research microscope.
Microphotographs were taken with a Leica DFC 420 digital microscope camera with
c-mount interface and with a 5 megapixel CCD. Sections were prepared by hand and
examined in Merck Lugol’s iodine (I) and water. Ascospores were measured in water.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascospores and asci measurements are given by the arithmetic mean ﬂanked by the
mean ± standard deviation and parenthetical minimum and maximum values. All
measurements and ratios include the halo in ascospores. The length/breadth ascospore

[@Gemmaspora lecanorae (Werner) D. Hawksw. & Halıcı#Misc-exposition*]
[@A detailed description is provided by Hawksworth & Halıcı (2007).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species is lichenicolous on the thallus of Aspicilia species and evidently
commensalistic, as no damage or discoloration was observed in the host thallus.
Perithecia are black, >300 µm wide, semi-immersed to almost superﬁcial. Asci
are 8-spored and ascospores (0–)1-septate, with very thick cell walls, which are
2-layered, and very broadly ellipsoid to globose, (12–)12.5–13–14 × 8.5–9 µm
with l/b ratio (1.35–)1.4–1.5–1.6(–1.65).#Description*]
[@Gemmaspora lecanorae was previously known from just two localities: Syria,
on the thallus of Aspicilia cf. farinosa, and Turkey, on the thallus of Circinaria
calcarea (L.) A. Nordin & al. (Hawksworth & Halıcı 2007). New to Uzbekistan

saxicolous lichens including Rhizocarpon, Ophioparma, and Protoparmelia
(Triebel 1989, Ihlen & Wedin 2008, Halıcı 2008) and apparently commensalistic,

from a L. frustulosa thallus by K. Mereschkowsky near Simpheropol in Crimea
(Hafellner 1985). This is still the only known Ukrainian locality of this species,
but it has not yet been reported in Ukrainian check-lists (Kondratyuk at al.

[@Weddellomyces heterochrous Nav.-Ros. & Cl. Roux#Misc-exposition*]

[@Figure 1#Figure*]

[@A detailed description is provided by Navarro-Rosinés & Roux (1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species is lichenicolous on the areoles of Aspicilia and Circinaria species
and causes a slight bleaching in the infected parts. It is weakly parasitic. The
following description is based on our collection on Aspicilia contorta subsp.
hoﬀmanniana S. Ekman & Fröberg ex R. Sant.

[@Lichenicolous fungi new to Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan & Ukraine ... 135#Page-header*]

Asci cylindrical or largely cylindrical clavate, (110–)111–113–115(–118) ×
(18–)19.5–20.5–21.5(–25) µm (n = 20), 4–6–8-spored, wall gradually thickened
towards the apex, I–, ocular chamber present. Ascospores 3-septate, brown,
terminal cells concolorous with central cells, surface smooth, halonate, halo ~1
µm, slightly constricted at the septa, but sometimes strongly constricted in the
middle septa, heteropolar, uniseriate or irregularly biseriate in the asci, (21–)23–
25–27(–28) × (8–)9–9.5–10(–11) μm (n = 40), l/b = (2.2–)2.4–2.6–2.8(–3.1)
The ascospore sizes in our data and cited in the literature seem very variable.
In the original description, based on a single type on Circinaria calcarea, the
ascospores (primarily 3-septate) measure (25–)26.5–30.4–35.5(–38) × (10–)11–
12–13.5(–14.5) µm (Navarro-Rosinés & Roux 1995). In a Turkish collection on
an Aspicilia species, the ascospores measured (32–)36–40 × 11–13 µm (Halıcı
et al. 2007). More collections are needed to reassess the ascospore size and host
variations and to determine whether more than a single taxon exists.#Description*]
