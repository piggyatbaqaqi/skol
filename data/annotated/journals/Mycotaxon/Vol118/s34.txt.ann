[@Abstract – A new corticioid genus, Hallenbergia, and its single species, H. singularis, are
described from Thimphu, Bhutan.#Abstract*]
[@Key words – Eastern Himalaya, Nawephu, angiosperm host#Key-words*]

[@While conducting a fungal foray in Nawephu of Thimphu, Bhutan, Dhingra
made a collection on decaying angiospermous twigs. On the basis of
macroscopic and microscopic characters it was compared with similar genera
within Corticiaceae s.l. (Rattan 1977, Eriksson & Ryvarden 1976, Hjortstam et
al. 1987) but could not be assigned to any already known, hence the description
of a new genus. Morphological traits show similarities with Hypochnicium and
Intextomyces.#Misc-exposition*]

suburniform, 4-sterigmate. Basidiospores ellipsoid to ovoid or subglobose,
smooth, with thickened walls, cyanophilous, inamyloid.#Description*]
[@Remarks—Hallenbergia resembles the genus Hypochnicium in having broadly
ellipsoid to subglobose basidiospores with somewhat thick and cyanophilous
walls. There are also aﬃnities with Intextomyces in having a densely interwoven
texture. The new genus diﬀers from both genera by the peculiar hyphal texture,

[@Hallenbergia singularis gen. & sp. nov. (Bhutan) ... 291#Page-header*]

[@Fig. 5. Hallenbergia singularis: basidiocarp showing hymenial surface.#Figure*]

with a densely and irregularly branched lower part and a pseudoparenchymatous
upper part. Moreover, it diﬀers from Intextomyces in the way basidia are
formed. In I. contiguus (P. Karst.) J. Erikss. & Ryvarden, basidia are formed
at the apex of penetrating, sinuous hyphae, while in H. singularis the basidia
are directly produced from the surface of the pseudoparenchymatic tissue.
A sample has been studied by Prof. John Eriksson and Prof. Nils Hallenberg,
who both supported the concept of a new genus.#Comments*]

up to 4.5 µm wide, thin-walled, septate, clamped; basal hyphae irregularly
branched and interwoven into a dense texture, covered in the upper half by
some crystalline material, followed by a narrow zone of compactly packed
horizontal hyphae; subhymenial hyphae short-celled, compactly packed and

ellipsoid, then broadly subclavate to suburniform, rarely sinuous, basal clamp
not observed, 4-sterigmate, with oily contents; sterigmata up to 7 µm long; a new
basidium generally takes the place of a decomposed basidium. Basidiospores
6–9 × 4.5–7.5 µm, broadly ellipsoid to ovate or subglobose, smooth, somewhat
thick-walled, cyanophilous, inamyloid, with one large guttule or many small
oil drops.#Description*]
[@Remarks—As mentioned above Hallenbergia singularis is superﬁcially similar
to Intextomyces contiguus. The latter species is easily distinguished by smaller
spores and basidia.#Comments*]
