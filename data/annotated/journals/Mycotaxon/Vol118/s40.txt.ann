[@Abstract —Glomus cubense (Glomeraceae, Glomeromycetes) was isolated from a lagoon
vegetation area on a clay soil deposition environment in the vicinity of San José de las Lajas,
Cuba. The species description is based on spore morphological parameters from in vivo pot
cultures and molecular analyses. The new species is characterized by its small, generally
irregular in shape, 20-48 × (24–)54-72 μm hyaline to faintly yellow spores that have a 2layered spore wall and arise in clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of the rDNA ITS region and
H+ATPase place the species into the Glomeraceae without close relatives among named
Glomus species. Glomus cubense forms mycorrhizal associations with sorghum and leek
plants under greenhouse pot-culture growing conditions and with a diversity of crop plants
under ﬁeld conditions. The name cubense refers to Cuba, the country where the species was
found.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Since 1973, numerous investigations on the diversity of arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been performed in Cuba, and several species
have been described and surveyed from this country (Herrera & Ferrer 1980;
Ferrer & Herrera 1981, Herrera-Peraza et al. 2003). With respect to research
and development on the selection of AMF strains with potential for use as
bio-inoculants for agriculture and horticulture productions, AMF species
populations were surveyed and propagated in pure cultures, characterized
morphologically, and simultaneously tested for performance at stimulating

[@338 ... Rodríguez & al.#Page-header*]
plant yields under both controlled and ﬁeld conditions (Rivera et al. 2003, 2007;
Herrera-Peraza et al. 2011). Among the AMF strains surveyed and tested, there
was an undescribed species, here named Glomus cubense, which formed small,
hyaline, 2-layered glomoid spores in clusters around roots. Morphological
and molecular comparisons with other light-coloured glomoïd spore species
(Błaszkowski et al. 2010) clearly distinguished G. cubense from previously
described species. Once propagated in pot cultures, it showed high root
colonization potential and growth beneﬁts over a variety of crop plants tested.
In the present paper, the fungus is proposed as a new arbuscular mycorrhizal
species, G. cubense, in the Glomeromycota.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
AMF strain propagation and evaluation were conducted in the central greenhouse
of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (INCA) in San José de las Lajas, Cuba.
Species morphological and molecular characterizations were done at the Eastern Cereal
and Oilseed Research Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Canada.
[@AMF sampling and propagation#Section-header*]

Soil samples were collected at about 50 cm depth from a lagoon area at “San
Rafael” Pond in “Las Papas” area (San José de las Lajas, Cuba), with a Haplic Cambisol
(chromic) soil (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006), a natural soil deposition environment
occasionally ﬂooded and mainly covered with Cynodon nlemfuensis and Mimosa pigra.
Mixed soil samples were used to establish pot trap-cultures using Sorghum bicolor as host
plant. After a four months growth period, spores of AMF were isolated by morphotypes
and used as inoculant for the establishment of pure cultures in sterilized (121°C for
3 h during three days) clay substrate from a “Gley vértico cálcico” soil (Instituto de
Suelos 1999) from “Guayabal” farm in San José de las Lajas, Cuba. Plants were fertilized
and watered at regular intervals (Hewitt 1966). Pure strain cultures were subsequently
maintained as reference culture on sorghum plants under semi-controlled greenhouse
conditions.
[@AMF isolation and characterization#Section-header*]

Spores were extracted from the substrate by wet-sieving (300–38 μm mesh sieves)
and centrifugation in sucrose gradient (Dalpé & Hamel 2007). Spores were then
manually isolated from the supernatant under the dissecting microscope (Olympus
SZ-PT) by micropipetting. Plant roots were washed in water, bleached in 2.5% KOH
and stained with fuchsin acid (0.01% in lacto-glycerol) (Kormanik & McGraw 1982).
Once destained in lacto-glycerol, root sections were mounted on microscope slides in
polyvinyl alcohol-lactic acid-glycerol (PVLG) (Omar et al. 1979), a mixture of PVLG and
Melzer’s reagent (1:1, v/v), or a mixture of PVLG and Cotton Blue (0.15% in lactic acid)
(1:1, v/v). Spore morphology and spore wall architecture were based on examination
of about a 100 spores. Color observations referred to the color chart code of the
International Culture Collection of Arbuscular and Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal
Fungi (INVAM; http://invam.caf.wvu.edu/). Microscopic observations were performed
with a Nikon Eclipse 800 compound microscope equipped with Nomarski diﬀerential

[@Glomus cubense sp. nov. (Cuba) ... 339#Page-header*]

interference contrast optics and photographs were taken with a Nikon CoolPix 4500
digital camera. Nomenclature and AMF classiﬁcation follow Schüßler & Walker (2010).
Reference specimens were deposited at the Cuban National Herbarium, IES-CITMA
(HAC) Cuba, and at the National Mycological Herbarium (DAOM) Canada.
[@Molecular analyses#Section-header*]

Spore clusters were collected under a low magniﬁcation binocular, rinsed with ddH2O
and air-dried. DNA extraction was performed using the PrepMan Ultra (PMU) reagent
(Applied Biosystems). A ratio of 10 spores/µl of PMU reagent were crushed using sterile
plastic micropestle. Initial PCR reaction for H+ ATPase was performed following Sokolski
et al. (2010) with primer GmossATPup1058 (5ʹ-cgg tac ttt gtt ctg ata aga c-3ʹ)
and primer mix GintraATPlo2663, GmossATPlo2663, GcoroATPlo2663. Three nested
PCR were performed using primers pairs:1) GintraATPup1104, GmossATPup1104
with GintraATPlo2663, GmossATPlo2663, GcoroATPlo2663 (Sokolski et al. (2010), 2)
GlomusATPup1150 (5ʹ-wtc hgc yga acc tgg tgc-3ʹ) with GlomusATPlo2557 (5ʹ-ctk
ght ttw gaw ggc cak aat-3ʹ) at 52oC or 3) with GintraATPlo2663, GmossATPlo2663,
GcoroATPlo2663 at 58oC. The ITS rDNA primers pair used were: GLO2A-forward
(5ʹ-cgt aac aag gtt tcc gta gg-3ʹ), GLO2R-reverse (5ʹ-gcg ggt act cct acc tga
tt-3ʹ)(Sokolski et al. 2010). PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning®
Kits (Invitrogen, USA). Cloned products were puriﬁed using the GenEluteTM Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (Sigma, USA). Cloning and DNA extraction were performed following
the instructions of the manufacturer for rDNA ITS. Between two and eight rDNA ITS
molecular clones (av. four) were selected. H+ ATPase and ITS were sequenced using
the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, Calif.) and run on an ABI 3100-Avant automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems/
Hitachi). Sequence editing was done using SeqMan (DNASTAR, www.dnastar.com/),
resulting in 1305 bp and 537, 546 and 549 bp alignments, respectively. The sequences
obtained were compared with those in the GenBank databases using the BLAST program.
Sequences retrieved from GenBank and those in this study were aligned by Muscle
3.8.31 and a neighbour-joining tree inferred using MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al. 2011) with
1000 replicates. The best-ﬁt model (General Time Reversible plus Gamma) was selected
using the web-based MODELTEST 3.7 (Posada 2006). Sequences were deposited in
GenBank under accession numbers JF510464 for H+ ATPase and JF692724, JF692725,
JF692726 for ITS rDNA.#Materials-methods*]

[@Distribution and habitat. Glomus cubense is only known from a single
location: “Las Papas” area, San José de las Lajas, Cuba (22°57ʹ41ʺN 82°09ʹ04ʺW).
Spores were originally isolated from Haplic Cambisol (chromic) soil collected
at ca. 50 cm depth. The soil corresponds to a “Fersialítico Pardo rojizo mullido
carbonatado” soil (Instituto de Suelos, 1999). The species was propagated in potculture using the same type of soil originating from the same area in Cuba.#Habitat-distribution*]
[@Notes

The main distinctive morphological properties of G. cubense are its small
hyaline to very light yellow, usually irregularly-shaped spores (Figs 1–2, 6–8)
and its 2-layered spore wall (Figs 3–5) composed of a permanent, ﬂexible to
semi-ﬂexible outer layer staining distinctly in Cotton Blue (Figs 4–5) and a rigid
inner layer, non-reactive to Melzer’s reagent. Under the dissecting microscope,
G. cubense may resemble most glomoid small-sized and pale-colored spores
as treated in the Błaszkowski et al. (2010) identiﬁcation key. However, when
observed under the compound microscope, only six named species produce
glomoid pale coloured, inamyloid and 2-layered spores that are smaller than 80
µm. These are G. bistratum (Błaszkowski et al. 2009b), G. cerebriforme McGee
(McGee 1986), G. indicum Błaszk. et al. (Błaszkowski et al. 2010), G. minutum
Błaszk. et al. (Błaszkowski et al. 2000), G. pallidum I.R. Hall (Hall 1977; Oehl et
al. 2003), and G. perpusillum Błaszk. & Kovács (Błaszkowski et al. 2009a).
The G. cerebriforme and G. perpusillum spore wall layer 1 is laminate (vs.
ﬂexible in G. cubense) and much thicker than spore wall layer 2 (vs. opposite in
G. cubense). Additionally, spore wall layer 2 of G. perpusillum stains in Melzer’s
reagent (vs. no staining in G. cubense). In the spore wall of the other species
listed above, layer 1 is a permanent structure, semi-ﬂexible to rigid, thinner
than layer 2 as in G. cubense but layer 2 is laminate. The G. minutum spores
are only hyaline and of globose to subglobose shape (vs. hyaline to very pale
yellow, and mostly of irregular shape in G. cubense). While spore wall layer 1
easily separates from spore wall layer 2 in freshly crushed G. cubense spores,
that of G. minutum generally remains adherent to the laminate spore wall 2. In
G. minutum, spore wall layer 1 sometimes swells and separates from spore wall
layer 2, but only when spores are mounted in lactic acid-based mountants for
at least some hours.#Comments*]

[@Glomus cubense sp. nov. (Cuba) ... 345#Page-header*]

[@Glomus microaggregatum Koske et al. also produces small, 2-layered spores
frequently irregular in shape, but the spores are much darker-colored (yellow
to brownish yellow), their spore wall is thicker (up to 4 µm vs. up to 2.7 in
G. cubense) and comprises a rigid outer layer and a ﬂexible inner layer (vs.
ﬂexible to semi-ﬂexible outer layer and rigid inner layer in G. cubense).
The spore wall of G. fragile and G. canadense also consists of a hyaline outer
layer and a pale yellow inner layer. However, observation of their respective type
specimens (K Berkeley 1182, FH 5045) revealed that the inner spore wall layer
in both species is thicker than that of G. cubense and laminate (Gerdemann &
Trappe (1974).
Young or small-sized clustered spores of Glomus viscosum may resemble
those of G. cubense, but they usually are globose, have a 3-layered spore wall, of
which layer 3 is distinctively laminate.
Compared with G. cubense, glomoid spores of Paraglomus spp are hyaline to
pale cream, they form only singly (vs. in cluster in G. cubense) and their spore
wall layers clearly diﬀer phenotypically from those of G. cubense (Błaszkowski
et al. 2010).
Ambispora spp. diﬀerentiate hyaline but much larger spores (Walker et al.
2007).
The phylogenetic analyses of sequences of the H+ATPase gene clearly
support morphological analyses and separate G. cubense from the few sequences
actually available and conﬁrmed the eﬃciency of earlier published primers for
sequencing Glomus species (Sokolski et al. 2010). The analyses of ITS region
conﬁrm that the species G. cubense is a member of the genus Glomus sensu
Schüβler & Walker (2010) in the family Glomeraceae without having any
close described relatives. When comparing ITS sequence data, the best Blast
alignment with Genbank database sequences indicated a maximum of 83 and
85% similarity with an as yet uncultured Glomus sp. thus supporting the status
of G. cubense as a distinct species.#Comments*]
