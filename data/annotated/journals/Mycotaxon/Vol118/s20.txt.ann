[@Abstract — A new species of Microcyclospora, associated with leaf spots on Rumex crispus,
is fully described and illustrated.#Abstract*]
[@Key words — hyphomycetes, Pseudocercospora, weed, cercosporoid fungi#Key-words*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@During the study of alternative weed hosts for Cercospora beticola Sacc.,
a causal agent of cercospora leaf spot of sugar beet in Northern Iran, a
species of the genus Microcyclospora J. Frank et al. was isolated from Rumex
crispus showing leaf spot symptoms in the Talesh region (Guilan province).
Microcyclospora, with M. pomicola J. Frank et al. designated as type species, was
recently segregated from Pseudocercospora Speg. s. str. based on phylogenetic
and morphological diﬀerences (Frank et al. 2010). Currently the three species
known in Microcyclospora are associated with sooty blotch and ﬂyspeck (SBFS)
blemishes on the surfaces of pomaceous fruits, speciﬁcally apples (Colby 1920;
Frank et al. 2010). Here we describe a new Microcyclospora species from leaf
spots on Rumex crispus that diﬀers morphologically from the three other
known species of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conditions of isolation, culture, and observation#Section-header*]

Leaf samples of Rumex crispus showing leaf spot were collected from Rainforest
Mountains in the Talesh region, Guilan province, in northern Iran near the Caspian
Sea. Single conidial isolates were established directly from symptomatic curly dock
leaves according to Bakhshi et al. (2011). A mass of conidia scraped from the lesion
using a sterile inoculation needle under a stereomicroscope was ﬂoated in 10 ml sterile
distilled water and spread on 2% malt extract agar (MEA; Fluka, Germany). After plates

[@182 ... Arzanlou & Bakhshi#Page-header*]
were incubated in a slanted position overnight, germinated conidia were transferred
to new MEA plates, and cultures were incubated in the dark at 25 °C. After 30 days of
incubation, samples from the colony were mounted on glass slides in clear lactic acid
for microscopic examination. Thirty measurements were made for each microscopic
structure, and 95% conﬁdence intervals were derived for the measurements with
extreme values given in parentheses. Line drawings were prepared using a BX41 light
microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with a drawing tube; photos were captured
using a Leica camera system. Colony colors on MEA and oatmeal agar (OA; Gams et
al. 2007) [surface and reverse] were determined after one month at 25 °C in the dark.
Nomenclature and descriptions were deposited in MycoBank. The holotype voucher
and an ex-type culture are conserved in CCTU, the culture collection housed at the
Plant Protection Department, Agriculture Faculty, University of Tabriz, Iran.#Materials-methods*]

[@Culture characteristics — On MEA slow growing, reaching 3 mm diam after 7 d,
and up to 10 mm after 2 weeks at 25 °C, raised, unevenly folded, with moderate,
smoke-gray aerial mycelium; surface irregular, with smooth, lobate margins,
iron-grey; iron-grey in reverse. Colonies on OA reaching up to 2 mm diam
after 7 d, and 6 mm after 2 weeks at 25 °C, ﬂat, submerged, with sparse aerial
mycelium and smooth margin. Microcyclic conidiation commonly observed
on all media in culture.
In vitro on MEA — Mycelium consisting of branched, smooth, septate,
pale brown, 2–4 µm wide hyphae developing numerous chlamydospores,
intercalary and terminal, medium brown, 6–20 µm diam. Conidiophores
reduced to conidiogenous cells, integrated, lateral on hyphae, mono- to
polyblastic, subdenticulate, 2.5–4 µm wide, 8–13 µm tall, hyaline, smooth.
Conidia scolecosporous, cylindrical, straight to variously curved, guttulate,
apex obtuse, base truncate, hyaline, (1.5–)2.5(–4) × (15–)37–54(–100) µm,
1–10-septate; hila neither thickened nor darkened; microcyclic conidiation
commonly observed; older conidia developing intercalary chlamydospores that
are pale brown, ≤ 9 µm diam.#Description*]
[@Discussion

The cercosporoids are amongst the major groups of fungi and generally
cause leaf spot diseases on almost all families of ﬂowering plants throughout

[@Microcyclospora rumicis sp. nov. (Iran) ... 183#Page-header*]

the world. Among these, Pseudocercospora is the second largest cercosporoid
genus, with more than 300 published names (Kirk et al. 2008). Recently it was
shown that Pseudocercospora included taxa that vary considerably in their
conidiomatal morphology, ranging from solitary conidiogenous loci, synnemata,
sporodochia to fascicles. Moreover, conidia in some taxa are transversely
euseptate but with some oblique and longitudinal septa or containing a mixture
of eu- and distoseptation. Conidial hila and scars vary from unnoticeable to
slightly thickened along the rim (Stewart et al. 1999). Even though the conidia

are commonly solitary, they may in some cases also occur in unbranched
chains (Braun 1995). Frank et al. (2010) established Microcyclospora based on
morphological and molecular data. Morphologically, Microcyclospora can be
distinguished from Pseudocercospora by the arrangement of the conidiophores
that are never fasciculate but reduced to solitary conidiogenous loci on
hyphae and conidia that aggregate in mucoid masses, strongly tending toward
microcyclic conidiation. Only three other species described in the genus
—M. malicola J. Frank et al., M. pomicola, and M. tardicrescens J. Frank et
al.— associated with sooty blotch and ﬂyspeck (SBFS) blemishes on surfaces of
pomaceous fruits (Frank et al. 2010). Here, we introduce a new species based
on morphological characteristics. Microcyclospora rumicis, like M. tardicrescens,
forms intercalary chlamydospores (lacking in M. malicola and M. pomicola)
and grows more slowly in culture. Chlamydospores of M. rumicis are longer
(≤ 20 µm) than those of M. tardicrescens (≤ 5 µm long).
Little is known about sexual stages of the cercosporoid fungi including
Microcyclospora species. Cercosporoids have been traditionally treated as
anamorphs of the ascomycete Mycosphaerella Johanson (e.g., Braun & Mel’nik
1997, Kim & Shin 1998, Crous & Braun 2003). However, most cercosporoids

[@Microcyclospora rumicis sp. nov. (Iran) ... 185#Page-header*]

are considered exclusively asexual, and Mycosphaerella teleomorphs have been
conﬁrmed for only a few species.
Phylogenies derived from multiple sequence analyses place Microcyclospora
with other cercosporoid fungi in the Mycosphaerella clade (Mycosphaerellaceae,
Capnodiales, Dothideomycetidae; Frank et al. 2010). Mycosphaerella, one of the
largest genera in the Ascomycota, comprises several thousand species (Crous et
al. 2001, 2009a,b; Aptroot 2006). Contrary to the assumption that Mycosphaerella
as then deﬁned was monophyletic, Crous and co-workers recently revealed
that the genus is polyphyletic and split the former Mycosphaerellaceae into
several families, of which the Mycosphaerellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae and
Schizothyriaceae have plant-pathological importance (Crous et al. 2007, 2009a).
Among the vast number of anamorphs in these lineages, up to 30 anamorph
genera have been linked to Mycosphaerella (Crous et al. 2007, 2009a; Arzanlou
et al. 2007). Recent phylogenetic analysis based on multiple sequence data sets,
however, indicate that these interpretations are not quite correct (Crous et al.
2009b) and that the Mycosphaerellaceae encompass instead numerous genera
with morphologically conserved Mycosphaerella-like teleomorphs but quite
distinct anamorphs (Crous et al. 2007, 2009b).
Little is currently known about ecology, host ranges, and sexual stages of the
cercosporoid fungi including Microcyclospora species, and more sampling on
diﬀerent substrates is needed to address these aspects.#Comments*]
