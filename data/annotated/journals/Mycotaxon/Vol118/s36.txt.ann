[@Abstract — Four species of smut fungi, Antherospora vaillantii, Microbotryum holostei,
Urocystis magica, and U. muscaridis, are reported for the ﬁrst time in Israel. Urocystis magica
was found in the Judean desert on a new host plant, Allium rothii, and M. holostei is new for
Asia.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@The smut fungi that occur in Israel have been studied by mycologists and
phytopathologists since the start of the 1900s (Magnus 1900; Reichert 1921,
1930, 1931; Săvulescu & Rayss 1935; Rayss & Zwirn 1944; Rayss 1952; Palti et
al. 1966). Nevertheless, knowledge about species composition and distribution
of these fungi was incomplete until a critical revision of the published accounts
of smut fungi in Israel that showed 59 species were recorded (Savchenko et al.
2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@During February–March 2011, we collected plants infected by smut fungi,
mainly in the territory of Mount Carmel, a coastal mountain range in northern
Israel that stretches southeast from the Mediterranean Sea. This region is
botanically very rich in species with a typical East-Mediterranean ﬂora with
luxuriant herbaceous components. Some of them are host plants for smut fungi.
In the present study we report three smut species found in this region and one
species from the Judean Desert.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Sorus and spore characteristics were studied using both fresh and dried herbarium
specimens. Spores were dispersed in a droplet of lactophenol on a microscope slide,

[@304 ... Savchenko & al.#Page-header*]
covered with a cover glass, gently heated to boiling point to rehydrate the spores,
cooled, and then examined by a Carl Zeiss Axiostar light microscope (LM) at 1000×
magniﬁcation. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), spores were attached to
specimen holders by double-sided adhesive tape and coated with gold. The surface
structure of spores was observed at 15 kV and photographed with a scanning electron
microscope JEOL JSM-6700F. Specimens used in this study are stored in the Herbarium
of Haifa University (HAI).#Materials-methods*]

[@Note. The genus Antherospora R. Bauer et al. consists of eight species of
smut fungi that infect the anthers and inner ﬂoral organs of host plants in the
Hyacinthaceae (Liliaceae s.l.) (Vánky 2009). The genus diﬀers from all other
taxa of Urocystales by the organogenic specialization, lack of sterile cells, and
development of single spores (Bauer et al. 2008). Most of its species are highly
specialized parasite restricted to certain host plant genera. Only one other
Antherospora species, A. urgineae (Maire) R. Bauer et al. on Urginea maritima
(L.) Baker, is known to occur in Israel (Săvulescu & Rayss 1935, Savchenko
et al. 2010). Antherospora vaillantii is easily distinguishable from A. urgineae,
which has smaller spores (9.5–15(–17.5) × 7–12 μm in diam.) and hosts in
diﬀerent genera.#Misc-exposition*]

Savchenko (HAI 2858).#Specimens*]

[@Note. Only three species of Microbotryum Lév. were reported from Israel
before our investigations: M. cordae (Liro) G. Deml & Prillinger on Polygonum
acuminatum Kunth (Polygonaceae), M. jehudanum (Zundel) Vánky on Silene
apetala Willd. (Caryophyllaceae), and M. scorzonerae (Alb. & Schwein.)
G. Deml & Prillinger on Scorzonera papposa DC. (Asteraceae) (Rayss 1952, Rayss
& Zwirn 1944, Savchenko et al. 2010). All three are typical ovaricolous species.
Israel has a great diversity of potential hosts for smuts from Microbotryum,
especially those parasitizing Caryophyllaceae (43 Silene species grow in the
country; Feinbrun-Dothan & Danin 1998). Microbotryum holostei has probably
been overlooked because of the inconspicuous symptoms of infection and prevernal development. To our knowledge, M. holostei has never been reported
from Asia.#Misc-exposition*]

K.G. Savchenko (HAI 2860).#Specimens*]

[@Note. During a collection trip to the Judean Desert in March 2011, one Allium
rothii plant was found infected by a smut fungus. Allium rothii belongs to the
subgenus Melanocrommyum and is distributed in Israel in the Judean Desert,
North and South Negev, and the Dead Sea area on rocky slopes between shrubs
(Kamenetsky 1994). Microscopic examination revealed that the smut was
U. magica s.l., not previously recorded in Israel (Savchenko et al. 2010). Allium
rothii represents a new host plant for this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Allium L. is a major genus of the monocot family Alliaceae naturally
distributed throughout the northern hemisphere that is represented by
ca. 750 species worldwide (Stearn 1992). Almost 40 species are known in
Israel (Feinbrun-Dothan & Danin 1998). According to recent taxonomical
changes based on nrDNA ITS sequence analyses, Allium is divided into 15
well-delimited monophyletic subgenera (Friesen et al. 2006). Species from

six subgenera —Allium, Amerallium, Cepa, Melanocrommyum, Polyprason,
Rhizirideum— have been found as hosts for Urocystis Rabenh. ex Fuckel. At
least ﬁve diﬀerent Urocystis taxa have been described from onion plants during
the last two centuries (see Vánky 1994): U. magica, U. cepulae Frost, U. colchici
f. allii-subhirsuti Beltrani, U. allii Schellenb., and Tuburcinia oblonga Massenot
(≡ U. oblonga (Massenot) H. Zogg). As these taxa are not easily distinguished
from one another, they have been treated as a single taxon, U. magica s.l. However,
these taxa were described from diﬀerent subgenera of Allium: U. magica s.str.
from subg. Melanocrommyum, U. cepulae from subg. Cepa, U. colchici f. alliisubhirsuti from subg. Amerallium, and U. allii and T. oblonga from subg. Allium.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Specialization on certain host plant subgenera or even species is not unusual
among smut fungi (cf. Entyloma species on Eryngium L.; Vánky 2009). Thus, it
is not inconceivable that these Urocystis taxa may be recognized as “good” or at
least “cryptic” species after intensive molecular-phylogenetic research.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note. Urocystis muscaridis infects diﬀerent species of Muscari Mill. in Europe
and Asia (Vánky 1994). Muscari comosum, a principal host for this smut, is
quite common in Mediterranean forests and semi-steppe shrub lands of Israel.
In March 2011 we examined a large M. comosum population in Carmel National
Park and found one plant with leaves bearing several swollen sori produced by
U. muscaridis. It is interesting that only a single plant in the whole population
was found to be aﬀected. In the Middle East U. muscaridis is also known from
Iran (Ershad & Deghani 2001).#Comments*]
