[@Abstract — The authors describe a new species of Eutypella (Diatrypaceae, Xylariales) based
on several collections on Suaeda vera in France and one on Salsola vermiculata in Spain. The
Libertella-like asexual state was obtained in culture.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@An ascomycete referable to Eutypella (Nitschke) Sacc. was repeatedly
collected on Suaeda vera J.F. Gmel. (Chenopodiaceae), a woody shrub occurring
in salt marshes in Ile de Ré (France), and once on Salsola vermiculata L.
(Chenopodiaceae) in a semi-arid environment in northern Spain. Salt marshes
are known to be peculiar ecosystems in which halophytes associate with both
terrestrial and marine mycota (Barata 2002). Previous investigations have been
carried out mainly on monocots such as Juncus roemerianus (Kohlmeyer et
al. 1995), Spartina sp. (Gessner & Kohlmeyer 1976), S. alterniﬂora (Gessner
1977), and S. maritima (Barata 2002), but little attention has been paid to
woody shrubs.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on extensive collecting of ascomycetes in Ile de Ré, this Eutypella
appears to be somewhat common in salt marshes but was never encountered
on the island out of this biotope. However, its occurrence on S. vermiculata
in a very diﬀerent environment in Spain suggests a stronger relationship to
Chenopodiaceae than to a speciﬁc ecological niche as ﬁrst assumed.
As it is also remarkable in possessing ellipsoid brown ascospores, we decided
to describe it as new. A typically diatrypaceous anamorph obtained in culture
conﬁrmed its placement in Diatrypaceae and a living culture was deposited in
CBS, allowing further phylogenetic investigations in the future.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods
Macro and microscopic observations were carried out following Rappaz’s (1987)
methodology, especially by testing the reaction of subapical ring to Melzer’s reagent
after pre-treatment in 3% KOH and by making measurements of asci and ascospores in
heated lactic cotton blue. Micrographs of asci were taken in Lugol’s solution (IKI), those
of conidiogenous structures and conidia were taken in dilute Waterman blue ink and
water. Cultures were made from single ascospores which were isolated on malt extract
agar (Difco™ Malt Extract Agar) according to Rossman’s (1999) method. The material
collected, along with duplicates of holotype, is kept in the the authors’ private herbaria
(JF and CLL numbers). The holotype is deposited in LIP herbarium (Lille) and cultures
at CBS.#Materials-methods*]

[@Discussion#Section-header*]

[@This ascomycete meets all the key features of the family Diatrypaceae Nitschke
in macromorphology, ascal morphology, and Libertella-like anamorph. It
only deviates in possessing ascospores that are ellipsoid and brown instead
of allantoid and yellowish as encountered in typical taxa. However, several
species in Anthostoma Nitschke, Cryptosphaeria Ces. & De Not., Diatrype
Fr. and Eutypella are known to have brown ascospores (Rappaz 1987, 1992),
and several of them —A. decipiens (DC.) Nitschke, C. subcutanea (Wahlenb.)
Rappaz, D. whitmanensis J. D. Rogers & Glawe, E. grandis (Nitschke) Sacc.,
E. corynostomoides (Rehm) Rappaz— produce such ellipsoid ascospores along
with broadly allantoid ones (Rappaz 1987).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The new taxon appears best accommodated in Eutypella as deﬁned by
Rappaz (1987) based on its pustulate stromata with stout, converging ostiolar
necks. Although the recent ITS sequence analysis of Diatrypaceae by Acero et al.
(2004) showed that Eutypella as currently conceived is most likely polyphyletic,
those authors did not propose any formal taxonomic changes. We therefore
refer the present fungus to Eutypella and await further molecular studies that
might shed some light on its aﬃnities within Diatrypaceae. A case was made
to reconsider its placement following Carmarán et al. (2006), who reinstated
Peroneutypa Berl. for taxa diﬀering from Eutypella in ascal morphology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eutypella phaeospora sp. nov. ... 445#Page-header*]

[@Although we did not use ﬂuorescence microscopy to study the morphology of
asci in E. phaeospora, the ascal shape and subapical ring clearly point towards
type I as deﬁned by the authors and therefore suggest a closer aﬃnity with
Eutypella as currently accepted (Rappaz 1987).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Eutypella phaeospora can be readily distinguished from other Eutypella
species through its consistently ellipsoid brown ascospores and occurrence on
members of Chenopodiaceae. The usually uniseriate ascospore arrangement
in the ascus correlated with the cylindrical shape of its spore-bearing part is
likewise a distinctive feature contrasting with the spindle-shaped ascus most
often encountered in Diatrypaceae. The fungus seems to be a common saprobe
occurring on Suaeda vera in France and on Salsola vermiculata in Spain.
Eutypella kochiana Rehm and E. alsophila (Durieu & Mont.) Berl. (which
occur on Chenopodiaceae in marine environments) are worth notice here, but
their asci have a clearly amyloid subapical ring and their ascospores markedly
diﬀer in being yellowish and allantoid. Eutypella kochiana var. salsolae Urries,
collected on Salsola vermiculata in Spain, resembles E. phaeospora in slightly
larger ascospores (4.8–8 × 1.8–2.2 µm —vs. 4.8–6 × 1.5–1.8 µm in E. kochiana)
that are sometimes oblong to broadly ellipsoid (Rappaz 1987). However that
variety still diﬀers in having asci with a clearly amyloid subapical ring and
narrower, yellowish ascospores. The above collection of E. kochiana var. salsolae
does suggest that at least two diﬀerent Eutypella species do occur on Salsola
vermiculata, whereas E. phaeospora is the only Eutypella species known thus
far to occur on Suaeda vera.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on many occurrences of E. phaeospora on S. vera in salt marshes
in Ile de Ré and absence inland, it was ﬁrst assumed that the new species was
restricted to coastal environments. However, the material collected in Spain
from a very diﬀerent environment —a semi-arid area far inland— points
towards a disjunct distribution not correlated with salt marshes. The fact that
Salsola vermiculata is an invasive shrub that can thrive in both coastal wetlands
and inland semi-arid areas may explain this apparent discrepancy. Therefore,
it could be assumed that Eutypella phaeospora exhibits a strong preference
for Chenopodiaceae species regardless of ecological niche. Occurrence of
E. phaeospora on S. vermiculata in salt marshes is predictable but should be
conﬁrmed by further sampling in coastal areas. Whether E. phaeospora occurs
on other members of Chenopodiaceae or possibly on other shrubs is likewise
still unknown, and it is hoped the morphological characterization given above
will help elucidate its apparently complex ecology.#Misc-exposition*]
