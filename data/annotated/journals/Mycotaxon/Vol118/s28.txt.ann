[@Abstract — Morphological study of an anthericolous smut fungus on Scilla sardensis
(Chionodoxa sardensis) and S. luciliae (Chionodoxa luciliae) from UK has shown it to
represent Antherospora scillae. This is also known in UK on Scilla verna and S. forbesii,
new host records for this species. The new species, Urocystis bolboschoeni on Bolboschoenus
maritimus, is described and illustrated from UK.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@In the current taxonomic scheme of the Ustilaginomycetes, the genus Ustilago
is restricted to species parasitizing plants of Poaceae (Vánky 1999, 2002).
For species on Liliaceae s. lat. previously referred to Ustilago, Ershad (2000)
erected a new genus, Vankya, with three species: V. heuﬂeri (Fuckel) Ershad
on Erythronium and Tulipa; V. ornithogali (J.C. Schmidt & Kunze) Ershad on
Gagea; and V. vaillantii (Tul. & C. Tul.) Ershad on Albuca, Bellevalia, Eucomis,
Hyacinthus, Muscari, Puschkinia, Scilla (including Chionodoxa), and Urginea.
Vankya was later restricted to the species on leaves and stems of liliaceous
plants: V. heuﬂeri, V. ornithogali, and the recently described V. lloydiae Vánky
on Lloydia triﬂora (Ledeb.) Baker (Vánky 2009a). For the anthericolous smut
fungus Vankya vaillantii s. lat. on plants of Asparagaceae (syn. Hyacinthaceae;
Liliaceae p.p.), Bauer et al. (2008) described a new genus, Antherospora, with
seven species: A. albucae (Syd. & P. Syd.) R. Bauer et al. on Albuca, A. peglerae
(Bubák et al.) R. Bauer et al. on Ornithogalum, A. scillae on Scilla bifolia L.,
A. tourneuxii (A.A. Fisch. Waldh.) R. Bauer et al. on Bellevalia, A. urgineae
(Maire) R. Bauer et al. on Urginea, A. vaillantii (Tul. & C. Tul.) R. Bauer et al.

on Muscari, and the cryptic species A. vindobonensis R. Bauer et al. on Scilla
vindobonensis Speta. An eighth species, A. eucomis Vánky on Eucomis, was
added by Vánky (2009b). The narrow host association of these anthericolous
smut fungi (Bauer et al. 2008, Vánky 2009b) warranted closer study of the
morphology of Antherospora species on Chionodoxa (currently treated as
members of Scilla). The result of this study is presented here.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In June 2010, two specimens of Urocystis in leaves of Bolboschoenus maritimus
were collected by Mr N.W. Legon in South Devon, England. No Urocystis has
been previously recorded on Bolboschoenus nor on plants of related genera
(Scirpus, Holoschoenus, Isolepis, Schoenoplectus, Trichophorum). We consider
those specimens as belonging to a new species, described below.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods
Dried specimens from the mycological collection of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
[K(M)] were examined under light (LM) and scanning electron (SEM) microscopes. For
LM observations, spores were mounted in lactophenol solution on glass slides, gently
heated to boiling point to rehydrate the spores, and then cooled. Spore measurements
are given in the form: min–max [mean ± 1 standard deviation]. In the description, the
total number of spores (n) from all collections (x) measured are given in the form ‘(n/x)’.
For SEM, spores were attached to specimen holders by double-sided adhesive tape and
coated with gold with an ion sputter. The surface structure of spores was observed at 10
kV and photographed with a JEOL JSM-5510 scanning electron microscope.#Materials-methods*]

[@Comments — The study of this fungus on these two hosts was provoked by
the high host specialization amongst Antherospora species infecting Scilla
with the presumption that A. scillae is restricted to Scilla bifolia as suggested
by Bauer et al. (2008: 1302). Bauer et al. (2008) described both Antherospora
scillae on Scilla bifolia and A. vindobonensis on Scilla vindobonensis as having

spore walls with a thickness of ca 0.5 μm. The specimens we examined on Scilla
sardensis and S. luciliae have spores with a thicker wall (0.7–1.0 μm wide), and
it seemed warranted to make additional observations of the spore wall on S.
bifolia. We found that the spore wall thickness of two specimens on S. bifolia
measured 0.7–0.9 μm (Vánky Ustilag. exs. no. 57) and 0.8–1.1 μm (SOMF
19206). Additionally, Vánky (2009b) cited a spore wall thickness of 0.8–1.5 μm
for Antherospora scillae. Our spore measurements from four specimens of A.
scillae on Scilla bifolia (Vánky Ustilag. exs. no. 57; SOMF 2859, 2888, & 19206)
(7–14.5 × 6.5–10 [9.8 ± 1.1 × 8.5 ± 0.7] μm; n/4 = 350) resembled those of the
British specimens we examined.#Comments*]

[@Currently, there is no molecular phylogenetic inference for distinguishing
the anthericolous smut fungus on Scilla sardensis and S. luciliae from that on
S. bifolia. Because no morphological diﬀerences were found, we identiﬁed
Antherospora scillae as the fungus on the British specimens that we examined.
This anthericolous smut fungus known in UK on Scilla verna Huds. (several
collections) has been recently collected also on S. forbesii (Baker) Speta (≡
Chionodoxa forbesii Baker) [K(M) 169982]. Scilla sardensis, S. luciliae, S. verna,
and S. forbesii are new host records for Antherospora scillae.#Comments*]

[@Comments — On Cyperaceae three Urocystis species have been described: (i)
U. ﬁscheri Körn. ex G. Winter on species of Carex, with type on C. acuta L.
from Germany; distributed in Europe, Asia, and North America (sori in leaves
and culms, spore balls 20–40 µm long, composed of 1–3 (–4) fertile spores);
(ii) U. littoralis (Lagerh.) Zundel on Carex maritima Gunnerus from Norway
(sori in leaves, spore balls 25–50 µm long, composed of (1–) 2–6 (–9) fertile
spores); and (iii) U. chorizandrae Cunningt. et al. on Chorizandra enodis Nees
from Australia (sori in leaves and sterile culms, spore balls 25–50 µm long,
composed of 1–5 (–8) fertile spores) (Vánky & Shivas 2003, Vánky 2009c).
It is remarkable that no smut has been previously reported on this common
and widely distributed host species.#Comments*]
