[@Abstract — A new Cortinarius (subg. Phlegmacium) species is described from northern
California. Cortinarius mikedavisii is a brightly colored bulbopodium in sect. Laeticolores.
Phylogenetically it belongs in the /cupreorufus clade.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Section-header*]

[@Cortinarius sect. Laeticolores M.M. Moser ex Moënne-Locc. & Reumaux
was erected to accommodate some of the brightly colored bulbopodiums of
subg. Phlegmacium. The section type was originally designated as “Cortinarius
orichalceus” (a misapplied name, not conspeciﬁc with Agaricus orichalceus
Batsch); its valid name is Cortinarius cupreorufus Brandrud (Brandrud et al.
1994).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recent molecular studies (Frøslev et al. 2007, Garnica et al. 2009), congruent
with my own phylogenetic analyses, show that the broad circumscription of
sect. Laeticolores by Moser (1960) and Bidaud et al. (2004) is polyphyletic.
However, a group of species around C. cupreorufus forms a well-supported
clade including C. rufo-olivaceus (Pers.) Fr. and C. prasinus (Schaeﬀ.) Fr. The
/cupreorufus clade, which represents the core of sect. Laeticolores, is well
represented in western North America with Cortinarius mikedavisii, described
here as new, and other undescribed species (Fig 1).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods
Methods for morphological studies and DNA extraction, PCR conditions and
primers, PCR product clean up, and sequencing were employed as outlined in Bojantchev
& Davis (2011). Color codes follow Munsell™ soil color charts (Anonymous 2000).
Collections are stored in the private herbarium of the ﬁrst author or at the University of
California herbarium in Berkeley (UC) where noted.

Phylogenetic analysis—During these studies all Cortinarius nrDNA sequences from
the public databases GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and UNITE (http://unite.
ut.ee/) were downloaded and reviewed. Preliminary phylogenetic analysis (not shown)
of 1012 Phlegmacium nrITS sequences from the northern hemisphere, including
312 sequences from the author’s own collections, clariﬁed the closest relatives of
C. mikedavisii and resolved its position within the /cupreorufus clade of the calochroid
super-clade as deﬁned by Frøslev et al. (2007) and Garnica et al. (2009).
A set of sixteen Phlegmacium sequences representing eight taxa was selected for
a detailed phylogenetic analysis. Twelve sequences were sourced from GenBank and
four sequences are from the author’s collections. Fourteen sequences were from the
/cupreorufus clade, represented by three well known European taxa combined with
C. mikedavisii and two western North American taxa close to C. cupreorufus. Cortinarius
sodagnitus Rob. Henry and C. piceae Frøslev et al. {formerly known as C. calochrous
var. coniferarum (M.M. Moser) Nezdojm.} were selected as the outgroup because they
represent the core of the calochroid cortinarii but are distant from the /cupreorufus
clade.

Sequence alignments were generated with MAFFT v6.821b (Katoh et al. 2002) with
the G–INS–i global alignment iterative reﬁnement strategy. Minimal gap opening and
extension penalties were set for better resolution of the more variables sectors within the
nrITS. The alignments were visually inspected and corrected where needed.
The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method as
implemented by MEGA5 (Tamura et al. 2007). The MP trees were generated by the
Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm with search level 0 in which the initial trees
were obtained with the random addition of sequences (10 replicates). The percentage
of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together was calculated from
a bootstrap test with 1000 replicates. The search resulted in thirty most parsimonious
trees (length = 97), which diﬀered mainly in the topology of the terminal nodes. One
tree is given in Fig. 1.#Materials-methods*]

[@Habitat and distribution — Cortinarius mikedavisii appears to be an
uncommon species. Currently it is known from only three locations, at two of
which it fruits regularly. The habitat is mixed woods with Sitka spruce (Picea
sitchensis (Bong.) Carrière) being the one common symbiont in all locations.
The author has never seen it south of Mendocino. Its distribution appears to
be limited to northern California and southern Oregon, where it was collected
once. There are no matching records from Washington and British Columbia
despite the intensive collecting and molecular cataloguing that has taken place
in these regions.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Discussion

Cortinarius mikedavisii is a beautiful species that so stands out with its large
size and bright colors that it should present no diﬃculty for ﬁeld identiﬁcation.
The distinctive alkaline color reaction indicates the presence of rufoolivacin,
an anthraquinone compound, which Steglich & Oertel (1985) detected in other
members of the /cupreorufus clade.
Phylogenetically, C. mikedavisii (Fig 1) stands almost equidistant in the
clade between the two main branches of C. cupreorufus and C. rufo-olivaceus.
Cortinarius rufo-olivaceus, a beech associate from Europe, is not known from

American ally diﬀer in the straw yellow lamellae and generally more pale olive
pileus, colors noticeable in all stages of development. The alkaline reactions in
C. mikedavisii are more intense than seen in C. cupreorufus, and the context
turns lilac to purplish red immediately, bypassing the pale olive stage. There is
