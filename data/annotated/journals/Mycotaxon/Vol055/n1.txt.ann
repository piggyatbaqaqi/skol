[@Part I: 1796-1871#Misc-exposition*]

[@EMORY G. SIMMONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@717 Thornwood Road, Crawfordsville, IN 47933#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@All taxon names published in the period 1796-1871
that are known to bear on the classification of Alternaria
species are discussed. Opinions are given on typification,
uniqueness, and synonymy as well as compliance with the
International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). In
addition, all names published in the nomenclaturally, often
taxonomically overlapping genus Macrosporium during the
same period are handled in the same manner, whether they
have direct bearing on Alternaria taxonomy or not. System-
atic disposition of 112 names of the period is attempted.
The few new name combinations required for reasons of
taxonomic opinion or ICBN rules include: Clasterosporium
caricinum, Alternaria instipitata, Thyrostromella hetero-
spora, A. smyrnii, A. putrefaciens, and A. ulmi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All accepted taxa, and a few that are not, are
treated in a concurrently published set of Simmons, Alter-
naria Themes and Variations (112-144), with extended dis-
cussion, technical descriptions, illustrations of type or
other field specimens and of representative living cul-
tures, when available, and group comparisons with similar
taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]
[@Several factors have led to the following survey of
names that have been, are, or should be associated with the

genus Alternaria Nees : Fries (1816 : 1821).#Misc-exposition*]

[@One factor comprises the multitude of names, not only
of the 19th century but also of more recent vintage, that#Misc-exposition*]
[@2#Page-header*]

[@represent ill-defined “species"—the early ones because
their original descriptions were poor and their types have
disappeared or have not been analysed in modern times, the
more recent ones chiefly because so many of them have been
described without differential contrast with similar spe-
cies or have been proposed on the basis of the muchabused
"not previously reported on this host" approach. A house-
cleaning of these several hundreds of names is essential to
sustained progress in taxonomic revision of the genus and
to increased precision of procedures for identifying its
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another relentless force arises from the increasing
numbers of living Alternaria strains, isolated from innu-
merable substrates on a worldwide basis, that become avail-
able and warrant specific determinations. A high propor-
tion of such materials crowds morphologically within a
somewhat hazy popular concept of the generic type, A. al-
ternata (Fries) Keissler (1912), and of a few somewhat
similar species with chains of comparatively small (for
this genus) to moderate-size conidia. It is true that we
have little published guidance on species segregates in
this broad group other than the exploratory and highly
influential work of Neergaard (1945), the few selections
made by M. B. Ellis (1971, 1976), and some portions of
current studies by Simmons (1993, 1994). It also has
become abundantly apparent, in this age of the one-conidium
isolate grown under controlled conditions, that there are
numerous different and stable patterns of sporulation and
of individual conidium development within the A. alternata
species-group (the "A. tenuis auct. sensu lato" of Neer-
gaard), the A. tenuissima species-group, the A. infectoria
species-group comprising Alternaria anamorphs of the pleo-
sporaceous Lewia Barr & E. Simmons (Simmons 1986), and
other species complexes. Stable segregates from these
groups merit description and naming on the basis of dis-
tinctive living isolates.#Misc-exposition*]


[@In this step-by-step, chronologically ordered
exploration of Alternaria species (and several that are
not), comments are made on each published name, with atten-
tion to compliance with the International Code of Botanical
Nomenclature (ICBN; Greuter et al. 1994, or other specified
editions of the Code when pertinent), typification, unique-
ness of species, and synonymy. In general, only published
names that have been or, in my opinion, should be combined
or synonymized in Alternaria are discussed. However, an
attempt is made to dispose of all names published in Mac-
rosporium Fries (1832), even when they do not represent
Alternaria, for Macrosporium was for about a century the#Misc-exposition*]

[@impartial recipient of names of fungi now recognized as
species of Alternaria, Stemphylium, Ulocladium and, to a
minor extent, other dematiaceous genera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other conventions of reference adopted are:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whenever the treatment of a name and the taxon it repre-
sents requires illustrations or more than a few sentences
of comment or comparison, the expanded material is pre-
sented as a numbered unit in the separate series of essays
Alternaria Themes and Variations initiated and in continua-
tion for this purpose (Simmons 1981-1995; Simmons and
Roberts 1993). A device "Alt.T&V no. ..." is used for
referring to these numbered units, whose places of publica-
tion are listed in Literature Cited.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Institutional herbaria are cited by means of appropriate
abbreviations, e.g., UPS, from the list compiled for Index
Herbariorum (Holmgren et al. 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@My own record/study numbers are cited whenever they are
relevant. Each such number is unique to a specimen or
isolate and to its derivative slide preparations, illustra-
tions, related data, distributed cultures and herbarium
deposits, and publications. Citation of an EGS number is a
positive statement that I have examined or produced the
associated material and am not simply quoting previous
authors. The reference format used herein is, e. g., EGS
11-042, which signifies my record book no. 1l, p. 42 (each
book having 200 pages).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sections of text are presented in chronological order of
publication of names, e.g., 1796 Uredo bullata Persoon.
Within the text a device "Alt. Chronology ....[date]" is
used to refer to the discussion of an associated taxon name
in another section of the text, e.g., "Alt. Chronology
1796" serves as guide to the discussion under 1796 Uredo
bullata. Each date used in such an internal reference also
is included with its related author entry in Literature
Cited.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Short paragraphs of text introduced by a colon mark are
related parts of series that share a common introductory
paragraph or heading, e.g., this series of reference con-
ventions, and infrequently, in the chronological text, a
series of short entries whose brevity or degree of signifi-
cance does not merit repetition of bibliographic data.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Persoon's holotype specimen (L, no. 910,263-1168; EGS
11-042) bears a species of Urediniomycetes. Its name is
listed here only because it entered the Alternaria litera-
ture in the form "A. bullata. Fr." (Alt. Chronology 1849)
after having passed through several generic transfers and
spelling transformations in the early 19th century. Re-
lated names, all obligately synonymous, include Bullaria
umbelliferarum DC. (Alt. Chronology 1805), Stilbospora
bullata (Pers.) Link (Alt. Chronology 1816), Didymosporium
bullatum (Pers.) Fr. (Alt. Chronology 1832), and Phragmo-
trichum bullaria Corda (Alt. Chronology 1837). H. and P.
Sydow (1902-1904) compiled most of the synonyms under
Puccinia bullata (Pers.) Winter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1803 Puccinia convallariae Schumacher, Enum. Plant. Saell.
IL... DB. 238.#Nomenclature*]

[@This is the basionym of Macrosporium convallariae
(Schum. : Fr.) Fr. (Alt. Chronology 1832), which possibly
is an Alternaria, and just as likely is not. Wiltshire
(1933), in his detailed review of the foundation species of
Alternaria and Macrosporium, determined that there is no
pertinent specimen in either the Schumacher herbarium at C
or that of Fries at UPS. Having duplicated Wiltshire’s
search for such a specimen and expanded it with con-
siderable search of my own for instructive types, illustra-
tions, exsiccati, and literature, I conclude that the iden-
tity of the fungus represented by Schumacher's and Fries's
binomials cannot be determined. The hopelesness of sug-
gesting an application for some very early names (and
sometimes modern ones) in the absence of type material is
illustrated by Schumacher's description:  "Puccinia. 1583.
Convallariae, sparsa, subcongesta, sporulis ovatis subro-
tundis brevissime stipitatis. In foliis Convallariae
multiflorae. Septemb." In addition, there exists no body
of phytopathology information on Convallaria L. (Liliaceae)
that would encourage us to neotypify Schumacher's fungus
with a specimen of some orphan dematiaceous hyphomycete.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This original name for the type species of Alternaria
Nees : Fr. is untenable because Fries cited it only as a
synonym, "Alternaria tenuis. Nees!," when he published the
substitute name Torula alternata Fr. (Alt. Chronology 1832)
in the ICBN-defined sanctioning work that covers Fungi
caeteri (Fries 1832). The correct name for this species in
Alternaria is A. alternata (Fr.) Keissler (1912). See
Simmons (1967) for a discussion of this genus typification
and for a description of an authentic Nees specimen chosen
as neotype (L, no. 910,262-129; EGS 11-050), which is anno-
tated "misit Nees in herb. Persoon" and bears what is
presumed to be a Nees manuscript label "Alternaria tenuis
mihi." And see Alt.T&V nos. 73 & 115 for amplified dis-
cussion of this species, its representation in pure cul-
ture, and its segregation from other taxa of Alternaria
with conidia of small or medium size.#Misc-exposition*]

with variously swollen, thick-walled, phaeodictyic hyphal
elements that are superficially alternarioid in appearance.
An appropriate transfer to the genus Peyronelia Cif. &
Gonz. Frag. has been made as P. rudis (Ehrenb.) S. Hughes
(1958). Portions of the Ehrenberg material are held in
several herbaria, including B, L, PC, STR, and UPS. Hughes
did not choose a lectotype; the portion at B (EGS 09-093)
is selected here for that purpose. Cfr. Alt.T&V no. 112.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire’s attempt (1933) to locate original Kunze
material of this species was unsuccessful. A candidate for
consideration as type specimen, labelled "Helmisporium

Alternaria that did not match Fries's description (1832).
However, a Desmaziéres exsiccatum (1827: PI. Crypt. France
no. 212), found in several herbaria (G, K, UPS, etc.) and
cited by Fries (l.c.), seemed to Wiltshire to fit Fries's
intent reasonably well, and it is this specimen and Wilt-
shire's illustrations of its conidia that have influenced
the species concept held by most publishing students of the
genus (Neergaard 1945, Joly 1964, M. B. Ellis 1971, Simmons

[@Under ICBN articles prior to those adopted at the
14th International Botanical Congress, Sydney, 1981 (Voss
et al. 1983), the Desmaziéres specimen could not, in a
strict construction of the rules, simply be chosen to
typify Helminthosporium tenuissimum in place of a Kunze
collection. Wiltshire, however, described the Desmaziéres
specimen as though it were the type when he proposed trans-
fer of the epithet from Macrosporium to Alternaria. And
most of us, knowing full well that Wiltshire quite possibly
had the wrong fungus and that a day of reckoning with the
ICBN was inevitable, followed his lead. Fear of such a
dies irae has vanished, in that decisions made at the
Sydney Congress (Voss et al. 1983, ICBN Art. 7.17), now
slightly reworded (Greuter et al. 1994, ICBN Art. 7.8),
permit typification through recognition of the holotype, by
selection of a lectotype from the original collection, if
available, or of a neotype, not only on the basis of the
protologue of the sanctioning author but also of "anything
associated with the name in that work."#Misc-exposition*]

portions of this exsiccatum known to me bear material of

present is an Alternaria; in my opinion it is not the same
species as that of the sanction-related neotype proposed
above. If the pre-1981 (Sydney) ICBN guidelineS on typifi-
cation were still in force, I would feel compelled to
maintain the Kunze specimen at P as holotype and proceed to
redefine and find a name for the Desmaziéres fungus. Under
the Sydney code revisions, current usage in line with
Wiltshire's studies can be maintained for Alternaria tenu-

[@Wiltshire (1947) performed a fundamental service when
he reviewed the published names and, to the extent possi-
ble, authentic specimens for all the Alternaria species
known or suspected to be parasitic on Brassica hosts. The
two most commonly encountered of these taxa are known cor-
rectly as A. brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (1880) and A. brassi-
cicola (Schw.) Wiltshire (1947). Wiltshire weighed the
merits and disposed of some 18 names of various degrees of
legitimacy thought to represent the relatively long-spored
(up to 200-300 µm long) A. brassicae, with its large, stout-
beaked conidia, and of some 12 names considered to be
related to a smaller-spored (up to about 120 µm long),
almost erostrate A. brassicicola. His publication must be

[@Although Wiltshire's final name assignments remain
supportable, he arrived at them in spite of misinterpreting
Saccardo's (1880, 1886) taxonomic views on A. brassicae.
Wiltshire's misunderstandings or omissions are pointed out
in Simmons (1995) in a discussion section on A. brassicae
that precedes Alt.T&V no. 135. The amplified discussion is
used to add bibliographic items significant to understand-

brassicae, items that Wiltshire did not mention but consid-

extremely complex nomenclatural tangle that he faced.#Misc-exposition*]

Montagne; EGS 09-197), is on decaying leaves of Brassica
oleracea and consists of a very scanty population of co-
nidia identifiable as Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.
Montagne's illustration and conidium length measurements
(200-250 µm) are good for A. brassicae. Montagne actually
published the name as "Puccinia? brassicae Montag." His
query was related not to the novelty of the species but to
the appropriateness of including it in the genus Puccinia,
for in discussion he introduced, but did not adopt, a genus
name Rhopalidium for the fungus. Fries (1832, p. 516-517,
footnote C) considered the fungus to be novel (on the basis
of a Montagne specimen) but preferred to postpone gracing
it with a name until another time (which is understandable
in that the footnote appears only 10 pages before the end
of the text of the Systema).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1849) described Rhopalidium Fr. & Mont.,
referring to his own 1832 footnote and Montagne's 1836

matically transfer the 1836 basionym to the new genus

genus name Rhopalidium is considered not to have been
published validly.#Misc-exposition*]

markably large for conidia of the sort shown with only 5-6

that, on the basis of Fée's illustrations, the species

general are obovate with a basal pigmented site; the ap-

conidia have relatively thick dark walls and septa, which
is somewhat unusual for the great majority of Alternaria
taxa. Nevertheless, a similar species (cfr. Alt. Chronol-

threads at their tips (the "heteronemum" of his epithet,
but actually bundles of conidiophores and great numbers of

[@The name is based on elements of two very different
fungi. It would be possible to select the Alternaria
element and make some attempt to treat it taxonomically,

Desmaziéres originally found enough muriform conidia to
guide his observations; however, I have found a total of
only 2-3 unquestionably alternarioid conidia after inten-
sive search of three parts of the distributed exsiccata, so
few that they might as likely have floated in from the air
as to have been borne on the leaves. The specimens are
worthless from a Macrosporium/Alternaria taxonomic view-
point; and the name, lacking the support of any sort of
modern species concept, should be allowed to fall into
total disuse without any attempt at selectotypification.

growth forms intermixed on the host to be different sporu-

ternarioides being simply a small-spored form arising in

the same spore form except that sporulation was on delicate

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphomycete taxa introduced under any genus name in
the literature of 1796-1871 that currently are recognized
as species of Alternaria are characterized on the bases of
type specimen, modern field material, and isolates in
culture, when possible. Species that are early examples of
morphologically similar species-groups are discussed along
with other already known or novel group members. Included
are A. eryngii, A. alternata sp.-grp., A. tenuissima sp.-
grp., A. cheiranthi sp.-grp. (9 spp. with A. atrocariis sp.
nov., A. carotiincultae sp. nov., A. selini sp. nov.), A.
brassicicola sp.-grp. (3 spp. with A. mimicula sp. nov.),
A. dauci, A. instipitata, A. smyrnii, A. ulmi, and A.
putrefaciens. The genus Nimbya, established earlier as
distinct from Alternaria, is discussed with N. alternan-
therae comb. nov., N. crassoides comb. nov., N. pimpriana
comb. nov., and N. celosiae sp. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@This group of taxonomic notes in the "Alt.T&V" series
is adjunct to "An Alternaria Chronology and Catalogue Rai-
sonné (1796-1871)," which is published concurrently (Sim-
mons 1995). The Chronology accounts for each name that has
been, is, or (when known to me) should be associated with
the genus Alternaria Nees : Fr. The published source of
each name is cited in the Chronology, along with in-
formation on its nomenclatural type, an opinion on the
legitimacy of the name, its current status, and the taxo-
nomic relationships of the fungus to which it refers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following notes expand upon the characters of
taxa accepted in the genus (and a few that are not), with
emphasis on groups of similar species, species differentia-
tion, representative isolates, and novel taxa.#Misc-exposition*]
[@56#Page-header*]

[@General Considerations and Conventions#Misc-exposition*]

[@Each specimen or isolate introduced into the discus-
sion is identified by standard herbarium abbreviation or
other source plus my record number, e.g., (L; EGS 11-050).
A device "Alt.T&V no. ..." is used for referring between
units in this series, whose places of publication are given
later in Literature Cited (Simmons 1981-1995; Simmons and
Roberts 1993). A similar device “Alt. Chronology ....
[date]" is used for referring to dated entries in the
concurrent "Alternaria Chronology and Catalogue Raisonné"
mentioned above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lists of synonyms established to date are appended to
names of some taxa treated below in numbered Alt.T&V
discussions. Individual synonyms may or may not be dis-
cussed in the Alt.T&V notes, but each always is treated
fully under its publication date in accompanying or future
portions of the Alt. Chronology. Synonymy entry symbols:
= obligate (same type), = taxonomic (opinion), ~ ICBN faulty
(named in literature but nomen nudum, type or description
inadequate, inseparable mixture, other as noted).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Attempts to define taxa for which living isolates are
available are based on simple culture and observation tech-
niques that can be reproduced in most laboratories. Each
isolate has undergone l-conidium or l-chain reisolation at
least once at my hands. Methods and media (PCA, Hay, V-8)
are as defined in Simmons and Roberts (1993). Observations
on hazards in taxonomic comparisons and suggestions for
laboratory protocols for Alternaria studies have been pub-
lished by Simmons (1992, in Cheikowski and Visconti, eds.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Description and comparisons of living material are,
to the greatest extent possible, based on cultures devel-
oped on potato-carrot agar. This relatively low-nutrient
medium is used as a standard because it supports good
colony development and good to excellent sporulation of
almost all stable Alternaria isolates and because it can be
duplicated readily worldwide. However, V-8 juice agar also
usually supports very abundant sporulation and, impor-
tantly, may accentuate differences of conidium morphology
among similar isolates.  V-8 agar is used for comparisons,
therefore, when there is a gain in morphological informa-
tion over that provided by PCA, e.g., in the treatment
below of the Alternaria tenuissima species-group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Inoculated plates are held at moderate temperatures
(ca. 22C) without humidity control (a gradually drying#Misc-exposition*]
[@ar#Page-header*]

[@atmosphere in temperate climates) under a cool-white fluo-
rescent light/dark cycle of ca. 8/16 hrs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sporulating samples for microscopic examination
usually are taken at a colony age of 1-2d in order to
capture the initial juvenile conidia, which, if catenulate,
may be strikingly different in shape from those produced
later in the same chain; always at ca. 4-7d, when the
population is likely to hold high percentages of morpholog-
ically fully developed conidia and the full range of
conidium size and shape possible under given conditions;
and often at ca. 10-14d, when the colony margin of most
isolates has reached culture plate limit, conidium pro-
duction has practically ceased, and the sporulation pattern
has reached its limits of branching (if any).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Relative size terms frequently are used to avoid
stating unnecessarily strict measurements in general
discussion. For this purpose "small" indicates a length
range up to ca. 30-40 µm; "medium" or "moderate" ca. 50-
100 µm; "large" ca. 100+µm, but certainly with overlapping
ranges, to be interpreted within the context of the
species-group under discussion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The terms "cicatrix" and "scar," as used by M. B.
Ellis (1971, 1976) in his descriptions of the contact areas
between Alternaria conidia and conidiophores, have not been
used here. The terms suggest some sort of structure that
becomes visible following separation of conidium and
conidiophore. The Alternaria conidial connective is, in
fact, extremely narrow, thread-like, and rarely seen in
ordinary inspection. When it breaks, the minute severed
ends (the only structures that might be termed "scars") re-
tract within the terminal walls and are hidden by a ring
area of pigment or by the wall curvature. It is this pig-
mented area, often present and conspicuous in Alternaria
whether the conidium remains attached or not, that has been
called scar or cicatrix. The terms seem to me inappropri-
ate. Lacking a better term, I usually have used "conidio-
genous site" plus any needed qualifying comment.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Study mounts routinely are made in U. S. pharmaceuti-
cal grade lactic acid (86%), which presumably becomes ca.
100% after routine gentle heating of slide preparations.
Lactic acid with Cotton Blue dye (0.05-1.0g/100ml ad lib.)
and glycerine is used rarely. NB: fresh conidia of a very
high proportion of well-pigmented isolates of Alternaria,
when examined microscopically in lactic acid, have colors
suggesting a dilute grey-green overcast that modifies#Misc-exposition*]
[@58#Page-header*]

[@underlying yellow-gold-brown tones; the grey-green cast
usually disappears within a few days, revealing the varie-
ties of wall color that then seem to remain unchanged for
long periods of time. Color comparisons of fresh material
with older, particularly herbarium material need to take
this phenomenon into account. It is equally important to
discount the kinds of excessive pigmentation, wall thicken-
ing, and spore ornamentation induced by exposure of devel-
oping cultures to near-UV radiation, a technique once
widely used to induce sporulation but not to be recommended
in comparison work, particularly between field growth and
laboratory culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@XIII. ALTERNARIOID PHAEODICTYOCHLAMYDOSPORES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Aerial chains of thick-walled, transversely to muri-
formly septate hyphal enlargements that develop apically
often mimic short chains of Alternaria conidia. These
thick-walled enlargements arise from morphologically unspe-
cialized hyphal sites; they secede through irregular frac-
ture of the sturdy isthmi that link them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Populations of some of these entities are distinctive
enough to have been described as species, sometimes in
Peyronellaea Goidanich (in Togliani 1952) or in Peyronelia
Cif. & Gonz. Frag. (1927), but also in Alternaria Nees
(1816) and Macrosporium Fr. (1832). The type of Peyronel-
laea, P. glomerata (Corda) Goidanich (in Togliani 1952)
incorporates both a characteristic pseudoalternarioid state
and a phomoid pycnidial state; Sutton (1980) includes
coelomycetes of this sort in Phoma Sacc. (1880a). Species
lacking a pycnidial state are included in Peyronelia.#Misc-exposition*]

not an Alternaria, it is considered here in order to intro-
duce a reference point for generically similar material
originally described in Alternaria or Macrosporium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@59#Page-header*]

[@on a pine trunk blackened by the fungus. The label on the
specimen selected as lectotype (B; EGS 09-093; Alt. Chro-
nology 1818) gives Berlin and April as additional data. No
author has added to the original description, which simply
states that A. rudis comprises a complex growth of small
stick-like fibers ("rudes") that are short, rigid, and
black and that have articulated nodular elements associated
with them. I am not aware of any more useful published
description or illustration, which has meant that what
possibly is a common wood-inhabiting fungus has remained
unidentifiable in general practice for 150 years or more.
Peyronelia rudis is described and illustrated here from the
lectotype and from what appears to be another portion of
the original Ehrenberg collection (UPS; EGS 09-032).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycelium on the substrate is medium orange-brown,
septate, 3-4 µm diam., often distinctly and coarsely rough;
hyphae often run parallel to the long axis of cells in
substrate tissue but usually branch on the exterior and
appear as a non-patterned network. Sporulation units are
produced as enlarging tips of short branches, at first
concolorous with surface mycelium but soon dark orange-
brown and finally black-brown and opaque. In type material
an occasional enlarging branch can be seen attached to the
hypha from which it developed; in most instances, however,
the enlarged branch elements have broken loose from the
mycelium or are so densely crowded on the substrate and so
nearly opaque that points of attachment cannot be traced.#Description*]

[@Main septa in young branches usually are transverse, later
ones longitudinal or oblique. Spore walls are thick and
externally coarsely rough. Spores are released by fracture
of the basal cell of the hyphal branches that produced
them; the basal cell is somewhat pale in contrast to the
dark color of the enlarged portion of the spore. The
enlarged phaeodictyic elements become subsphaeroidal to
ellipsoidal and commonly occur in chains of 2-3 units with
narrow, pale connective cells. Sizes of the multicellular
elements reach a range of 15-30 x 10-18 µm.#Description*]

[@A dense, matted mixture of hyphomycetous fungi nearly
covers the fat-soaked leaves that are the type substrate
(K; EGS 11-018). Berkeley (1845) illustrated elements of
the named fungus in such a way as to suggest Alternaria-
like, lanceolate or clavate phaeodictyospores. Some of the
fungus structures present are as drawn by Berkeley, i.e.
elongate phaeodictyic elements with a swollen, septate
central region and narrow, fractured ends. Other fungus
structures present in the mixture are of a small-spored
Alternaria unlike the type illustrations, a Curvularia, and
a miscellany of penicillioid conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

date being that of Persoon's Mycologia europaea. Nine of
these had been proposed by Persoon. According to Hughes

[@The one Persoon species of interest here, Conoplea
(eventually Alternaria) eryngii, was shifted to other
genera by Chevallier (1826) and Fries (1832). The same
fungus was described again in at least two other genera by
Desmaziéres (1846) and Rabenhorst (1867). (See synonymy
for Alternaria eryngii below.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@These several different interpretations need not be
surprising, for Persoon himself (1822) set a precedent by
suggesting in his type discussion that a new genus Elosia
possibly could be based on C. eryngii; a Persoon manuscript
name "Elosia Eryngii" actually appears on the label of the
Conoplea eryngii holotype specimen. Persoon did not,
however, proceed to use the genus name Elosia. When
attributed to Persoon, Elosia is an illegitimate provi-
sional name that has not been validated since it was
suggested in 1822.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria (Conoplea) eryngii appeared to Persoon at
first glance ("primo intuitu") to be a crust-like growth on
dry stalks of Eryngium campestre. With the aid of a lens
he was able to distinguish rounded clumps of very short,
rigid, black hyphae intermixed with turbinate spores; the
clumps were interspersed with subglobose, substipitate
cellular masses. The holotype (L, no. 910,263-1237; EGS

inadequate for recognition or comparison work, particularly
as no subsequent author has added illustrations or details

[@Mycelium of the holotype forms an irregular network
over and within the tissues of the host plant. Very numer-
ous small sclerotial units are scattered throughout the
network, both on the substrate surface and commonly vithin
single cells of the host tissue, where they assume the
general shape and size of the host cells. The sclerotia
consist of thick-walled, dark yellow-brown to brown, essen-
tially isodiametric cells; a high percentage of the sclero-
tia are in a size range of 35-50 x 45-75 µm. Conidiophores
are produced singly, but as many as 2-5 may arise separate-
ly from an individual sclerotium; 8-12 x 25-65 µm, 2-6
septate, medium yellow-brown, with a single well-defined
apical conidiogenous site and pigmented ring.  Conidia are
not seen attached to conidiophores or to each other in
chains; conidia with 2 or more conidiogenous beak sites are
rare. Conidia are short oval, short to long conical or
short to long ovoid; pale yellow-brown to medium yellow-
brown, becoming dark brown in the spore-body with a paler
beak; transverse septa (0-)3-7(-9), longitudinal 1-2 in
each of 1-5 of the transverse compartments; commonly 25-57
x 12-19 µm (max. 75 x 2lum, av. about 42 x 15.5 µm); beakless
or with 1-2 sturdy beak cells that taper gradually to a
blunt apex; beak portion at most 25 µm in length, and in
general not well delimited from body of conidium; outer
walls smooth, rarely inconspicuously rough.#Description*]

[@The obvious abundance of small conidiophorous sclero-
tia in this field specimen is in no way unique to A. eryn-
gii. Old herbaceous stems frequently have areas dotted
with such resistant structures, and it is fruitless to try
to predict for individual specimens what species of
Alternaria, Cladosporium, or other genus may emerge from
them when held in a damp chamber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name devised by Persoon and its sanctioned form
in Fries, Helminthosporium eryngii, did not come into

fungus in more usable terms in 1846 and made collections of
his Mystrosporium pyriforme more generally available as no.

or short-chain ovoid conidia with a bluntly rounded apex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two modern viable collections, almost certainly held
under artificially moist conditions before they were dried
for shipment to me, reveal a more complex and, at first,
puzzling picture of sporulation. Both specimens originated
in The Netherlands. One on diseased stems of Eryngium
planum became available in October 1985 through the gener-
osity of S. M. Francis (IMI 297763; EGS 38-138) and of the
originating institution, the Plantenziektenkundige Dienst
Wageningen. Another was on leaf spots of Eryngium sp.
intercepted in 1992 by New Zealand inspectors of fresh
flowers air-jetted from The Netherlands (Lynfield PPC,
Auckland, AK 4116; EGS 41-003); an isolate EGS 41-005 from
this latter specimen serves as the basis of culture obser-
vations below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most striking conidia in these modern specimens
have elongate, tapered but not filamentous beaks almost
concolorous with the spore bodies. Conidia of this sort
had not been seen in classical specimens of A. eryngii. An
initial inclination was to distinguish the long-beaked
taxon as a second species on members of this umbelliferous
genus, even though Ond¥ej (1974) had not done so when he
illustrated conidia 50-150(-180) x 10-16(-22)µm from a
specimen identified as A. eryngii on Eryngium campestre L.
The initial reaction cooled when it was found that moderate
numbers of typical (i.e., classical specimen) non-beaked A.
eryngii conidia were present in every slide preparation of
modern field material and that duplicates of the original
long-beaked conidia never were found in a score or more of
isolates grown under routine conditions of culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Returning to slides prepared from the original viable
specimens, it proved possible to select a series of conidia
that illustrate the development of typical blunt-apex
conidia into the considerably larger long-beak units. This
species provides an excellent example of the potential for
modifications in morphology of spores produced under
different conditions as well as of the ICBN reminder
(Greuter et al. 1994, ICBN Art. 7.2) that the "nomenclatu-
ral type [specimen] is not necessarily the most
representative element of a taxon."#Misc-exposition*]

[@culture, where it presents additional characters that cer-
tainly are not predictable from classical material and
scarcely so from abundant spore populations of the modern
collections seen. Notable among these characters are rapid
production of abundant, moderately long chains of conidia
and, in the conidia themselves, transverse septa of such
dark color that they almost appear to be (but are not)
embellisioid.#Description*]

[@Conidia develop in PCA cultures in unbranched or
branched chains, with a major axis of up to 8-10 units and
occasionally 1-2 lateral branches of 1-4 units. The bran-
ching may originate either in successive conidiogenous
sites of geniculate apical secondary conidiophores or from
short conidiophores produced laterally from conidium body
cells. Conidia are ellipsoid to ovoid, beakless when
terminal or, when intercalary in the chain, with a short,
poorly differentiated terminal area or cell that functions
as a conidiophore; secondary conidiophores sometimes are 2-
4 cells long. Conidia are essentially smooth or rarely
inconspicuously minutely rough, dilute grey-tan with
slightly darker septa; they commonly reach full size at ca.
45-60 x 13-18 µm and have 5-8 transverse septa and 1(-2)
longitudinal or oblique septa in a few of the central#Description*]

[@compartments. Most transverse septa appear somewhat
thickened and darker than the conidium wall, thus appearing
almost embellisioid. However, changing focus serially
through the septa shows that their denser color and appar-
ent thickness are due to the additive effect of pigmented
walls viewed at slightly tilted angles.#Description*]

[@XV. THE ALTERNARIA ALTERNATA SPECIES-GROUP#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is no modern consensus, general or specialist,
on the characters and circumscription of Alternaria alter-
nata (Fr. : Fr.) Keissler (1912) (originally A. tenuis Nees
1816). There never has been one at any time since Nees
introduced the genus (1816). I think that there never will
be one on the basis of identification of field specimens,
for the stable differences among isolates derived from
multiple, morphologically similar natural populations of A.
alternata sensu auct. spores are numerous and much too
diverse to be acceptable in a one-taxon concept of the
name. It remains to be tested whether or not a supportable
circumscription of the component species of the group can
be developed on the basis of isolates compared in pure cul-
ture, as I attempted to do recently in an intensive exami-
nation of the morphology of several hundred small-spored,#Misc-exposition*]
[@66#Page-header*]

[@catenate isolates (Simmons and Roberts 1993.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The neotype specimen of A. alternata has been
designated, discussed, described, and illustrated (Simmons
1967). (See A. alternata below for summary of 1967 obser-
vations.) Although the yield of morphological information
from the type is not abundant, it still is defensible to
state that similar material frequently is found in many
field collections, both classical and modern.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The problem that arises, in this age of taxonomically
profitable pure culture studies, is that even when field
specimens of Alternaria have some conidial characters in
common it seldom is possible to predict exactly what
pattern of sporulation and conidium morphology will develop
while a specimen is held in a damp chamber overnight. The
predictability level falls even lower when l-conidium and
l-chain isolates from several specimens are studied further
in parallel cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Alternaria that readily produce branching
chains of small to medium-size, short-beaked conidia
usually are equated with A. alternata. For purposes of
discussion, the A. alternata group of species is considered
to be represented by isolates that produce conidial chains
of moderate length (10-20 units, and more as branching
proceeds) on relatively short conidiophores; conidia that
may reach full size in a range of about 40-70 x 15-20 µm,
though some species of the group never have such maximum
conidium sizes in culture (e.g., A. alternata conidia
typically do not exceed 50 µm in culture); and conidial
bodies that for the most part lack a well-defined, apically
tapered portion (although a short-tapered beak may occur in
nature), the conidia usually proliferating by means of an
apical secondary conidiophore (pseudorostrum) that seldom
is more complex than 1-2 short cells.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A few well-known phytopathogenic species of the
small-spored, short-beaked, catenate group are readily
differentiated on a basis of conidium and colony morphology
and host relationship (e.g., A. longipes, A. brassicicola).
However, preponderant numbers of leafspot dwellers, stem
invaders, seed-coat colonizers, organic debris overwinter-
ers, endophytes, and air entrapments prove, when cultured,
to be species that readily produce chains of conidia that
are small to moderate in size. Much more often than not
these emerge from the determination process labeled, almost
in despair, as A. alternata, even when there are morpholog-
ical differences, as in A. gaisen Nagano, obvious to anyone#Misc-exposition*]
[@67#Page-header*]

[@who looks beyond overlapping size ranges of spores in slide
preparations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The extensive literature associated with the name A.
alternata abounds in comments on remarkable differences in
conidium size, shape, rostration, color, and ornamentation;
on chain length and pattern of branching; and on colony
characters of stable cultures. Unfortunately, a balanced
synthesis of such literature is not possible when the
cultural stability and health of isolates are not known;
when temperature and light conditions of culture are not
comparable; and when culture substrates range from minimal-
ly nutrient (water agar with wheat straws; hay decoction
agar), through low nutrient (potato/carrot agar) and moder-
ately nutrient (V-8 juice agar), to highly nutrient (malt
extract or maltose and potato/dextrose agars overloaded
with available carbohydrates). Associated with the vagar-
ies of observations on non-comparable cultures is the prac-
tice of attempting identifications primarily on the basis
of slide preparations of conidium samples from culture.
Even when the source culture is young and sporulating well,
the derivative slides contain populations of detached co-
nidia and conidiophores that yield few clues to the inher-
ent developmental patterns of individual conidia and of the
chains in which they were produced.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many of the classical specimens and taxa that have
influenced concepts of the A. alternata complex have been
illustrated and discussed most helpfully (though sometimes
with erroneous nomenclatural conclusions) by Mason (1928),
Wiltshire (1933), and Neergaard (1945). Neergaard, whose
studies of large numbers of isolates (mostly from Denmark)
remained until recent years our best introduction to the
group, devised a narrow concept for one commonly-encoun-
tered small-spored segregate and called it "Alternaria
tenuis [alternata] auct. sensu str."; his many other
similar but distinguishable isolates were disposed as
"Alternaria tenuis [alternata] auct. sensu lato."#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the past several years, even after growing and
comparing hundreds of isolates from a very broad geographic
and substrate range, I have, for the most part, declined to
give opinions in the group more precisely than "A. alter-
nata sp.-grp." or, when feeling particularly brave, "AI-
ternaria sp. near A. alternata but not identical" or an
equally equivocal "a distinct Alternaria sp. known to me
from other sources but not typical A. alternata."#Misc-exposition*]

[@The professional as well as the tyro, then, has#Misc-exposition*]
[@68#Page-header*]

[@little in the way of guidance and ends with either another
A. alternata (mis)determination or another "new species."
And this, of course, explains the difficult position of
reference culture collections, where nearly all holdings of
"A. alternata" should be labeled "auct. sensu lato," for if
one morphological entity of the holdings (any one) is
chosen as typical A. alternata, all of the others will be
demonstrably something else.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally, it is my purpose to present what I consider
to be typical A. alternata and to begin to segregate and
find names for other species of this dismayingly heteroge-
neous species-group. Over the years I have given the opin-
ion that there are a dozen to a score of distinguishable
species in the A. alternata group. I remain firmly and, I
believe, justifiably convinced in this opinion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several hundreds of the Alternaria isolates that I
have examined over the years fit a generalized definition
of the A. alternata group, as outlined above. Large num-
bers of these are practically worthless for purposes of
strict comparisons and identification, having originally
been or, over the years, become culturally unstable (poor-
ly- or non-sporulating, demonstrably internally parasi-
tized, or simply wet/collapsing/slimy). Attempts to stabi-
lize or to induce abundant sporulation in most of these
almost always have proved futile; once an Alternaria iso-
late has "gone bad" it usually defies rehabilitation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Still other isolates of the A. alternata group, num-
bered in the scores rather than in the hundreds, have
remained stable in growth and sporulation over the years.
The great diversity of their habitat and substrate sources
worldwide supports the expectation that some kind of taxo-
nomic sense can be made of the group when enough segregates
are defined for recognizable patterns of conidium and chain
development under defined, controlled culture conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Early clues to the existence of multiple distinguish-
able taxa become apparent when several isolated, morpho-
logically similar single conidia of "A. alternata group"
specimens give rise in culture to colonies that are dissim-
ilar in some macroscopic factor of growth rate, zonation,
mycelium density, apparent color, or timing and density of
sporulation. If in addition, low magnification (50x) exami-
nation of sporulation patterns reveals different systems of
branching, or none, then some macro- and mesoscopic diag-
nostic characters have become available. And if definable,
disjunct associations of colony and sporulation pattern can#Misc-exposition*]
[@69#Page-header*]

[@be shown to be linked consistently with some distinctive
conidium morphologies, we approach a classification system
for taxa of this heterospecific A. alternata group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This viewpoint and approach are not particularly
novel except that they have not been applied to the prob-
lems of characterizing Alternaria species. They constitute
essentially the same pattern of classification steps used
in differentiating closely similar species of Penicillium,
Aspergillus, Fusarium, etc., except that in Penicillium and
Aspergillus, for example, the morphology of the complex
conidiogenic apparatus gives more clues to diversity than
do the simple conidia, whereas just the converse is true in
the A. alternata group with its relatively simple conidio-
phores and heteromorphic conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A review of many of the most stable isolates of the
group has made it possible to select several mutually
exclusive patterns of conidium development and chain pro-
liferation. One of these patterns has been chosen to
represent what I consider to be typical A. alternata; this
pattern of specific characters will be the model against
which my comparisons of other segregates of the group will
be made in the future. The pattern has been discussed in a
preliminary way and illustrated in Simmons (1992) and in
Simmons and Roberts (1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The general appearance of the type is that of rela-.

short conical, narrowly tapered beak, some others are
beakless, and still others have a short apical secondary
conidiophore. Some of the conidia are punctate roughened,
others apparently smooth. Conidia are not strongly con-
stricted at any transverse septum, and no septum is remark-
ably thicker or darker than any other.#Description*]
[@70#Page-header*]

[@Materials incorporating conidia with very much the
same appearance have been collected in nature innumerable
times over the past 150+ yrs. Identifying all of them as
A. (tenuis) alternata has been the common practice which,
however, has fostered an unstrenuous, undiscriminating, and
therefore purposeless approach to a very complex group of
species. Further use of such uncritical identifications
frequently has been of little practical significance. But
when the need arises to know whether or not a group of
these similar collections actually represents a single
biological species (with similar substrate preference or
infectivity, seasonal occurrence, distribution, aller-
genicity, biochemical activity, etc.), then isolation,
cultivation, and examination of artificially produced
populations become necessary.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1985-86 I restudied scores of isolates that fall
within the concept of the "A. alternata group" outlined
above. Only well-stabilized isolates were considered for
promulgation as "representative" strains: no sectoring in
culture, no patches of sterile hyphae, no deliquescing
mycelium, no internal hyphal parasites. Perhaps half-a-
dozen definable segregates became apparent during this
initial review. Representative strains of A. alternata are
discussed here; others will be treated in more detail when
appropriate names for them are reached in the parallel
Alternaria Chronology. The representative strains of A.
alternata discussed here in my strictest interpretation of
the taxon are EGS 34-016, 34-039, 35-056 and 35-193. All
are on deposit with major international culture collections
(e.g., ATCC, CBS, DAOM, IFO, IMI). It has been my practice
for several years to recommend EGS 34-016 as a standard
strain for comparisons in allergy, phytopathology, metabo-
lite, molecular, and other areas of mycological research,
in hope of developing a strong data base on the taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates chosen to represent A. alternata do no
violence to the concepts held by Neergaard (1945, Fig. 8 &
9) for his "Alternaria tenuis auct. sensu str.," by M. B.
Ellis (1971, Fig. 330) for "Alternaria alternata," and by
Groves and Skolko (1944, Fig. 12) for their "Alternaria
tenuis auct.," although differences in culture conditions
(particularly their use of malt agars) make close compari-
sons impossible. Conidia and sporulation patterns from
representative isolates are illustrated in Fig. 93.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Radial growth rate of typical A. alternata colonies
is about 5mm/d under standard conditions.  Concentric rings
of alternating dense and moderate sporulation are obvious#Description*]
[@71#Page-header*]

[@on all media (particularly so on PCA and V-8); these
indicate increments of radial growth during successive
exposures to daily light/dark cycles. To the unaided eye
the less dense portions of the colonies (all media) appear
minutely but distinctly granular in transmitted light; each
minute spot is seen, at low magnification (50X), to be a
sporulation clump; each uncrowded sporulation unit near the
colony circumference can be seen to comprise a single,
usually erect conidiophore and a cluster of conidia in
branching chains. The colonies have no height above the
agar surface other than that of the conidiophores and their
spores, i. e., there is no non-sporulating surface or
aerial mass of mycelium, no sterile tufts of hyphae, and no
non-sporulating sectors by the end of 10-12 days under
specified conditions. Colony color and texture are simply
those of the massed sporulation apparatus, almost sooty
black and minutely tufted to densely turfy. No pigment is
released into the media.#Description*]

[@Conidiophores typically arise singly from vegetative
hyphae that are within or flat on the surface of the agar
substrate. On Hay the conidiophore tends to branch or
become successively geniculate near the substrate surface
and to initiate 2-8 chains that develop into a basally
tight, radially loose cluster of about 50-75 conidia. On
PCA, branching of the conidiophore is not a striking
character, although as many as 2-3 such branches (and
therefore 1-3 conidial chains) may occur. Instead, the
more obvious branching is initiated within the chains when
a few secondary conidiophores (intercalary conidial pseudo-
rostra) develop 2-3 conidiogenous loci.  Uncrowded sporula-
tion units on PCA reach a maximum of about 75-125 conidia;
the clusters appear looser and the chains longer than those
on Hay. In older portions of any colony, crowding of erect
conidiophores and their complements of aerial sporulation
present a picture of a solid turf of overlapping, inter-
twined conidial chains.#Description*]

[@Conidia appear olivaceous, a dull grey-green-brown,
when first mounted in lactic acid for microexamination;
they lose the green tone after a few days and exhibit pale
to moderate shades of a yellowish to golden brown. Al-
though the branched sporulation complex supported by a
single conidiophore often consists of more than 100 co-
nidia, single chains traced from initial to youngest
conidium (ignoring branches) have about 15-20 conidia on
PCA and 8-10 on Hay; the density of sporulation on V-8
permits only an estimate that chain lengths are about the
same as those produced on the other media.#Description*]
[@72#Page-header*]

[@A few conidiophores and their first 1-2 conidia are
produced within 24-48 hours after inoculation of media.
Initial conidia are narrowly ellipsoid when transverse
septa begin to form, progressively about 16 x 6 µm (1 sep-
tum) to about 25-40 x 8-10 µm (3-5 septa), at which stage
the distal cell produces a l-celled secondary conidiophore
approx. 4 x 4 µm. Initial juvenile conidia are subhyaline
and so densely, minutely granulate-roughened that septa can
be demonstrated only through careful focussing. The first
conidium produced and at least the second one of the chain
remain long elliptical as they mature with 4-6 transverse
and usually no (rarely 1-2) longitudinal septa. Young
conidia produced later in the chain are in general rela-
tively wider and shorter ovoid, ellipsoid or subsphaeroid,
maturing for the most part with 3-5 transverse septa (to 6-
7 on V-8) and 1 longitudinal septum (occasionally 2 in a
central transverse segment on Hay). Secondary conidio-
phores on conidia within the chain may be short, l-celled
(as in primary conidia), occasionally 2-3 times as long, or
sometimes reduced simply to a conidiogenous pore in an
otherwise undifferentiated apical cell. Constriction of
the conidium body at the transepta is minor, rarely con-
spicuous. Infrequently one median transeptum of a mature
conidium is slightly thicker and darker than the others; in
general, however, absence of a darker median septum is
characteristic of the group. The original minute, dense
ornamentation of juvenile spores usually becomes conspicu-
ously granular as conidium walls mature and darken; the
walls of some old spores often become variously verrucose.
At the same time the surface of the distal conidial cell
(the secondary conidiophore) remains quite smooth.#Description*]

[@Size ranges of mature conidia (ones that have pro-
duced a secondary conidium) in chain complexes that have
stopped producing new spores are about 10-30 x 5-12 µm
(PCA), 10-24 x 6-13 µm (Hay), and 13-43 x 8-14 µm (V-8),
excluding dimensions of secondary conidiophores. Size
range data of this sort is of extremely limited utility, if
any, in differentiating otherwise morphologically disparate
taxa within the A. alternata group. For example, maximum
length usually does not have positive correlation with
maximum width; and the total range itself may be duplicated
in a different taxon with a different pattern of conidium
enlargement and, therefore, of conidium and chain morphol-
ogy. Focus on patterns of conidium development within
single spore heads and on pattern of chain proliferation is
more useful in defining segregates than is attention to
overall size ranges.#Description*]

[@A few diagnostic characters have proved helpful in
screening typical A. alternata from somewhat similar taxa.
Positive identification of A. alternata rests on the entire
description of the species, but the shape of initial coni-
dia and the nature of the spore wall ornamentation are
constant enough among representatives chosen for the spe-
cies that I am using them, and promoting them, as bench-
marks of the taxon as long as they prove uniquely associ-
ated with the sporulation characters that additionally de-
fine the species. Specifically, the first conidium pro-
duced on a conidiophore of A. alternata usually is narrowly
elliptical, straight or slightly inequilateral, densely and
obscuringly minutely ornamented, and up to about 40 x 10 µm
with 3-5 transepta when it initiates an apical secondary
conidiophore. As for the surface ornamentation of conidia,
it often becomes progressively coarser and more striking as
conidia age. It is not invariably present; but when it is,
it can effectively mask young septa. Thus, at low power
magnification (150X) many conidia of all sizes, including
the largest, appear in surface view to be hazy-brown asep-
tate units; refocusing reveals septation that had been
obscured by overlying ornamentation.#Description*]

[@Typical A. tenuissima, as neotypified by Desmaziéres'
Plantes Crypt. France no. 212 (1827) (Alt. Chronology 1818,

either gradually into an awl-shaped beak or abruptly into a
cylindrical secondary conidiophore. Reconstructed from
drawings of conidia by Wiltshire (1933) and my own observa-
tions, sporulation in nature is in straight chains of a few
conidia. An apical secondary conidiophore occasionally
shows two sporulation sites, thus indicating the uncommon
existence of branching in the sporulation pattern.#Description*]

the complete transepta (the earliest formed) are darker and
more constrictive than the others. Conidia are pale brown
and have apparently smooth to obviously but sparingly
punctate-roughened outer walls.#Description*]

[@Primary conidiophores are ca. 50-60 x 4-5 µm and
geniculate and conidiogenous at 1-5 loci. As an historical
note, the epithet tenuissima originally referred to conid-
iophores of the fungus, "Fibrae tenuissimae," not to the
narrowly tapered conidium beaks that are characteristic of
some conidia in the neotype and that now are considered
diagnostic to some extent for the species-group.#Description*]

[@This unelaborated description of typical A. tenuis-
sima as a field specimen fits large numbers of field
collections and initial growths on innumerable different
substrates held for a few hours in a damp chamber.  How-
ever, our knowledge of field or first-growth conidium
morphology and sporulation patterns, and of their correla-
tion with the same characters as they develop over a few
days in axenic cultures, still remains too scanty for
predictability between field and culture dish.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For classification purposes, the Alternaria tenuis-
sima group is considered to comprise species that, on the
field substrate in nature or under short-term (1-2d) damp
chamber conditions, usually produce unbranched chains of a
few to many long-elliptical conidia that taper gradually
into a narrow but not truly filiform beak. Older conidia
often have a primary, almost median transverse septum that
appears darker and more constricting than are other tran-
septa. Branches a few conidia long may develop as the
chain reaches its maximum length. The length of tapered
beaks varies greatly in young chains, sometimes equalling
or exceeding the length of the spore body but usually being
shorter. Some species continue to produce long, tapered
beaks on essentially all spores as the chains mature with a
possible 10-20 catenate units. Other members of the
species-group tend to produce elongate beaks only on the
first few conidia of a chain (those proximal to the conid-
iophore), after which narrow true beaks are absent, with
short secondary conidiophores taking their place during
chain formation. Conidium wall ornamentation may be
lacking (as viewed at 780X), scattered but conspicuous, or
sometimes evenly, closely punctulate and almost obscurant
of internal septa.#Description*]
[@77#Page-header*]

[@Several conidia present in the type collection of A.
tenuissima are illustrated in Fig. 94. These help to
establish the appearance of the species as it sporulates in
nature under unknown conditions, and yield a few bits of
information useful in defining an A. tenuissima species-
group for classification purposes. However, as noted
above, the sporulation morphologies of axenic cultures
derived from conidia of this commonly encountered kind are
too diverse to be species predictable on the basis of the
original field collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examples of taxa that fit into this A. tenuissima
species-group concept are discussed below in Alt.T&V nos.
117-122. Previous discussions of three of these are found
in Alt.T&V no. 32 (Simmons 1990, as A. tenuissima group,
species 1), in Alt.T&V no. 33 (Simmons 1990, as A. tenuis-
sima grp., sp. 2), and in Alt.T&V no. 59 (Simmons 1993, as
A. tenuissima group, species 3). The several different
sporulation patterns and basic conidium morphologies
characterize stable, distinguishable populations as they
occur in axenic culture on V-8 juice agar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The culture medium of choice for description and
comparison in these Alt.T&V notes usually is PCA because
this relatively low-nutrient medium supports good growth
and sporulation of nearly all Alternaria isolates and
because it is easily prepared from readily available ingre-
dients. As an exception, V-8 agar is used here for the A.
tenuissima species-group because differences in conidium
morphology for component species are accentuated on this
medium. Use of PCA for study of many A. tenuissima group
members is de-emphasized because the medium encourages
chain development so rapid that there is a general reduc-
tion in conidium size, with the result that the typical A.
tenuissima characters of tapered conidia and strong median
septa become of minor occurrence.#Misc-exposition*]

hrs. on original inoculum) are essentially awl-shaped or at
least have a narrowly tapered upper half; only transverse
septa are present in these spores, which usually do not
exceed 50 x 8 µm. As additional conidia are added distally
to the chain, tapered-beak production is lost; new conidia
terminate abruptly in a short 1-2-celled secondary conidio-
phore. Colonies at 4d are dominated by unbranched chains
of 6-10 conidia. (Longer chains and uncommon branching may
be found in colonies aging past ca. 7d.)#Description*]

[@Fully developed chains of A. tenuissima produced
under standard conditions specified for these studies have
patterns of sporulation and of conidium morphology of
considerable diversity. This diversity, however, retains
some general characteristics with group classification
value, viz., the initial 1-2 and sometimes even 4-5 lowest
conidia of a chain usually have only transverse septa; only
one or two mature conidia in a chain have the helpfully
diagnostic median, subconstricting transverse septa that
are such a striking feature of field conidia; these median-
constricted conidia may be ovoid with a short apical
secondary conidiophore or obclavate and broadly tapered
into an apical conidiophore.#Description*]

[@Field specimen conidia of this taxon are very similar
to those of typical field conidia of A. tenuissima.  Spor-
ulation in culture of this Brassica isolate also is similar
to that found in representative isolates of A. tenuissima.
However, conidia of this canola isolate are in general
smaller, both in actual measurements and in general visual
impact of populations in slide preparations. This dif-
ference, notable even without resort to statistical compar-
ison, is attributable to the significant percentage of
relatively large obclavate and broadly tapered conidia (ca.
40-60 x 16-18 µm) present in the A. tenuissima isolate and
the near absence of this particular spore shape and size in
the canola isolate.#Description*]

[@Sporulation on the field specimen is a mixture of
ovoid to long obclavate conidia with short awl-shaped to
long tapering beaks and of similar spores with the beak
apex converted into a secondary conidiophore. A character-
istic slightly constricting median septum usually is
present. Largest conidia have 7-10 transverse septa and 1-
2 longisepta in a few of the transverse segments. Conidium
size reaches a range of ca. 60-90 x 15-18 µm; color is a
medium yellow-tan; ornamentation is lacking or minutely
punctulate.#Description*]

[@Chains produced on V-8 agar within an initial 4-5d
are unbranched and have 7-8 conidia. At this stage conidia
usually do not have narrowly tapered beaks; only a small
percentage of spores show enough broad taper that they
might be termed obclavate (in contrast to the common
occurrence of large obclavate conidia in spore populations
of A. tenuissima).  Conidia reach a size range of ca. 30-50

apical secondary conidiophores. This poor material might
be given tentative place in the A. tenuissima group, but
prediction of the kind of sporulation that might develop
from it would be quite impossible.#Description*]

[@Abundant sporulation on the field specimen under damp
chamber conditions and in subsequent isolates is of a taxon
that produces predominantly long, narrow, apically tapered
conidia in chains (at 4-5d) of ca. 6-10 spores. Only 1-2
spores in any chain exhibit the median constricting septum
character of the A. tenuissima group.  Conidia either are
relatively small (ca. 10-20 µm long), particularly at chain
tips, or fall in a size range of ca. 40-60 x 10-12 µm.
These characteristically long, narrowly elliptical or
obclavate conidia strongly dominate the population; they
have 7-9 transverse septa and either no longisepta or
usually only 1 in a few of the transverse segments. The
median septum usually is not constricting at this stage.
Color is a dilute tan; wall ornamentation is lacking or
minutely to conspicuously punctulate.#Description*]

[@This taxon isolated from Allium sp. borders on a
group of isolates that produce long unbranched chains of

[@XVII. THE ALTERNARIA CHEIRANTHI SPECIES-GROUP#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several previous units of these Alternaria studies
contain remarks on the nature of the secondary conidio-
phore, i.e., of the distinctive germination hypha produced
by a conidium that enables production of a second-genera-
tion conidium, thus forming a chain. It is essential to
maintain emphasis on this generative structure and on its
difference from non-conidiogenous true beaks if the so-
called chain-forming species of Alternaria are to be under-
stood and rational comparisons are to be made among them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many species of Alternaria produce conidia that are
simply ovoid to ellipsoid, without any sort of distally
tapered portion that might be defined as a beak. If they#Misc-exposition*]

[@produce secondary conidia (some species rarely do so), it
is through the agency of this secondary conidiophore, the
pseudorostrum, a morphologically distinct, new structure
that may be several-celled and many microns long, or just a
single short cylindrical cell, or even, at the extreme,
only a conidiogenous site in the wall of a pre-existing
conidial cell.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidia of Alternaria cheiranthi (Lib.) Bolle
(1924) are of this erostrate sort, producing conidia with a
rounded or, at most, a broadly tapered apex, but certainly
without a definable beak distinct from the spore body. In
nature these conidia often generate an apical secondary
conidiophore of one to a few conidiogenous cells, but the
original beakless spore body retains its identity.  Iso-
lates of A. cheiranthi readily produce short chains of
conidia in culture, but here again observable beaks are
only new conidiophores that have developed from apical and
occasionally lateral or basal cells. The conidia have an
overall robust, sturdy appearance due to the erostrate
nature and often thickened walls of the conidia and to
concentration of pigment in some of the septa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire's impression (1933) of A. cheiranthi was
that the species is "more like a Stemphylium than anything
else," with reference to his then nascent concept of a
"Pseudostemphylium section" of Stemphylium Wallr. and to S.
lanuginosum Harz (= Ulocladium lanuginosum (Harz) Simmons
(1967)). He concluded, however, that the overall picture
was alternarioid, primarily because of conidium chain
formation, and that Alternaria was the best genus choice
for this taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neergaard (1945), influenced not only by Wiltshire's
observations but also by the frequent occurrence of second-
ary conidiophores, which he recognized sometimes as part of
the conidium or at other times as "false" beaks, retained
the taxon as a catenate Alternaria species. At the same
time he segregated a few other taxa with quite similar
sporulation and conidium characteristics into the heterog-
eny of the subgenus Pseudostemphylium Wiltshire (1938), de-
emphasizing the fact that these segregates also could
sporulate in chains, though less exuberantly than does A.
cheiranthi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria cheiranthi is not a Ulocladium or a
Stemphylium (cfr. Simmons 1967). Along with Wiltshire, I
consider the species best placed in Alternaria, with
conidium development and morphology typically erostrate and#Misc-exposition*]
[@87#Page-header*]

[@with chain production restricted in nature and usually,
though not necessarily so, in culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A few other Alternaria taxa with conidia character-
ized by this strongly erostrate tendency, particularly in
specimens from nature, may mature with unusually dense
pigmentation in septa and in some instances with abundant
hyphal chlamydospores or strikingly enlarged macroconidio-
phores. Neergaard treated those known to him as species of
Stemphylium subgen. Pseudostemphylium. All are treated
here as taxa of the A. cheiranthi species-group, with the
name of this earliest described species used as a group
reference even though the name of any one of the better
known taxa, such as A. radicina, would be equally usable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These additional members of the species-group are the
commonly encountered A. radicina Meier, Drechsler & Eddy
(1922); the less frequently reported A. petroselini (Neer-
gaard) E. Simmons (in Ellis 1976); the species known for
several years as A. ramulosa (Sacc.) Joly (1964), now
revised as Alternaria smyrnii (Crouan) E. Simmons (1995;
Alt. Chronology 1867); A. instipitata (Preuss) Simmons
(1995; Alt. Chronology 1848); and A. japonica Yoshii (1941;
syn. = A. raphani Groves & Skolko [1944]). In addition
three new taxa are circumscribed. A key to these nine
members of the A. cheiranthi species-group now recognized
follows Alt.T&V 131.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Classification of the six previously named species in
this particular Alternaria group has bedevilled most stu-
dents of the genus, primarily because of the essentially
erostrate nature of the conidia and the tendency of conidia
to remain solitary or for chains of conidia to be short and
of condensed appearance and sometimes tardy formation, thus
contrasting with an overly generalized concept of Alter-
naria taxa as ready producers of chains of beaked conidia
or of solitary, long-beaked conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire (1933) hesitated generically over A. chei-
ranthi but finally opted for Alternaria.  Neergaard (1938)
first tried Thyrospora Tehon & Daniels (1925) for the very
similar A. radicina, then moved on (1939) to Stemphylium
Wallr. (1833) after Wiltshire (1938) established the syno-
nymy of Thyrospora and Stemphylium. At this time Neergaard
chose "Stemphylium (subgenus Pseudostemphylium Wiltshire)"
for disposition of his S. radicinum (Meier et al.) Neerg.,
because he perceived a resemblance between A. radicina and
the Stemphylium lanuginosum Harz (1871) that Wiltshire

classic studies of 1933 and 1938.) Neergaard did not dis-
tinguish generically between A. radicina and fungi now as-
signed to Ulocladium Preuss (cfr. Simmons 1967). Subra-
manian followed the lines of reasoning developed by Wilt-
shire and Neergaard and published Pseudostemphylium Subram.

lanuginosum (Harz) Simmons (1967) and including the itiner-
ant A. radicina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Over the past 40 years or so I have entertained all
of the misgivings expressed by these authors in their
systematic relocations of A. radicina, A. cheiranthi, and
similar species in and out of Alternaria. Ovoid, moderat-
ely dark-septate, non-beaked conidia are typical of all
species in the group, and a case perhaps could be made for
segregating them as Macrosporium Fr. (type M. cheiranthi
(Lib.) Fr.). They can be defined fairly well as a species-
group, but their generic segregation outside Alternaria
would have only a weak taxonomic and practical basis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fortunately, excellent isolates exist of all but one
(A. instipitata) of the species mentioned above for this
group. The decision to retain all of them in Alternaria is
based on field material and, when possible, young cultures,
and on the similar patterns of conidiophore production,
sporulation, and conidium morphology that exist before
species differences obscure the underlying similarities.#Misc-exposition*]

Fr.) Fr. is the type of Macrosporium Fr. (1832), a choice
mentioned by Berkeley (1845) and Wiltshire (1933), listed
by Hughes (1958), and followed by Simmons (1964) in his
proposal to conserve Alternaria Nees over Macrosporium Fr.
As long as A. cheiranthi is considered congeneric with A.
alternata (Fr. : Fr.) Keissler, which I do, the genus name
Macrosporium must remain in synonymy with Alternaria. If
ever the Libert fungus were differentiated authoritatively
from A. alternata at the genus level, Macrosporium would
come into legitimate use again for M. cheiranthi and simi-
lar species (and lead to a nomenclatural mess of ghastly
proportions).#Misc-exposition*]

[@There has been general agreement among Alternaria
specialists that Bolle (1924) was studying a species other
than Helminthosporium cheiranthi Libert when she estab-
lished a new name combination in Alternaria. (Her pub-
lished illustration is of conidia very similar to those of
A. tenuissima.)  Ramsbottom (1933) argued, without perma-
nent nomenclatural effect, that since two species were
involved there must therefore be two names; one would be
related to Bolle's work and her misidentified fungus, the
other to Wiltshire (1933) and the combination A. cheiran-
thi, because Wiltshire had studied the correct fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neergaard (1945) headed his treatment of this species
"Alternaria cheiranthi (Fr.) Bolle sensu Wiltshire 1933"
but added "According to the principles [Neergaard] advo-
cated in [his] section on Nomenclature, the fungus has to
be designated as Alternaria cheiranthi (Libert) Wiltshire."
Joly (1964) attributed the combination to Wiltshire.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire himself (1933) had not fallen into such a
trap of confusing taxonomic identity with nomenclatural
procedure; he attributed the authority of the name cor-
rectly (for 1933) and explained the taxonomic situation
succinctly by writing "Alternaria Cheiranthi (Fr.) Bolle,
excluding [her] specimen."#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is noted in passing that an attribution A. chei-
ranthi "(Berk.) Baela" [Bolle?] exists in the Japanese
literature (e.g., K. Hara, 1954). Also, A. cheiranthi
"(Lib.) Elliott" appears on some herbarium packets, presum-
ably with reference to J. A. Elliott (1917), although
Elliott did not actually make such an epithet transfer when
he suggested that Macrosporium cheiranthi Fr. and some
other species of Macrosporium "undoubtedly belong to
Alternaria."#Misc-exposition*]
[@90#Page-header*]

[@Wiltshire's study (1933) of A. cheiranthi can
scarcely be improved. He worked from a portion of the type
collection (K; EGS 11-005), collected, isolated and de-
scribed living material, provided precise illustrations and
diagnostic guidance, and correctly attributed the authority
of the name in Alternaria. A few of his observations need
to be abstracted and emphasized here along with some of my
own comments in order to place the species in a position of
comparison with the rest of the genus, for Wiltshire at the
time was discussing only the five early 19th century
foundation species of Alternaria and Macrosporium, only one
of which is of the A. cheiranthi species-group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria cheiranthi can be found in almost any
extensive planting of the wallflower Cheiranthus cheiri L.
(Brassicaceae). Leaf, stem, and seedpod lesions bearing
lush stands of olive green sporulation can be spotted
readily, for example, in English garden borders, where the
wallflower commonly is grown. The fungus is so prevalent
in plantings that wallflower seed in practically any
garden-shop packet will yield A. cheiranthi colonies under
damp chamber conditions (e.g., EGS 41-188 etc., from seed
purchased in U.S.A., spring 1994, with Italy as "country of
origin").#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire noted, as have I, that the species is known
until now only on wallflower. He reported (1933) examina-
tion of "Macrosporium cheiranthi" exsiccata [K] represent-
ing several other host plants and concluded that the fungus
was misidentified in each instance. Repeating some of his
examinations, I have reached the same conclusion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire's comments on the type specimen, his
cultures (on clear maize meal, potato-dextrose, Dox, and
bean agars), the microscopic details of sporulation, and
especially his illustrations are models of observation.
Only the character of conidium size given by him, 21-97 x
13-32 µm (type collection) and 27-87 x 14-28 µm (his 1930
specimen) needs clarification, for the maximum lengths
cited are exceptional and, for comparison purposes in the
species-group, misleading.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Re-examination of conidia from the type, and compari-
son with Wiltshire’s illustrations, show that his measured
length maxima are for conidia that have gone beyond the
rather regular bilateral symmetry of most spores into a
somewhat unrestrained pattern of cell division and swelling
(Wiltshire: "secondary growth"; "irregularly shaped con-
glomerations of cells") that gives a false picture of the#Misc-exposition*]

Neergaard (1945) gives a length range of 15.0-64.5 µm for
conidia produced experimentally on Cheiranthus seedlings.#Description*]

[@This clarification of maximum, pre-overdevelopment
size is not meant to obscure the fact that "secondary"
septation and enlargement are prominent characters of A.
cheiranthi conidia, both in nature and in culture. The
point is that comparison of commonly overdeveloped A.
cheiranthi conidia with conidia of other taxa that do not
have this tendency can scarcely be considered valid or
helpful in classification of the group. The observation
serves as a warning that it is not unknown for an unex-
plained discrepancy of ca. 15%, such as that between
Wiltshire's stated maximum length and measurements from his
illustrations and my slide preparations, to have served
some authors as reason for otherwise unjustified proposal
of new species in Alternaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidiophores of A. cheiranthi are produced in dense
stands both in nature and in culture.  Sporulation may be
from a single apical site (usually) or a few successive
sites at geniculations in conidiophores that vary in length
up to 500 µm or more x Sym. Conidia usually are solitary in
field lesions, although short secondary conidiophores on
some conidia indicate that short chains, probably of only
2-3 spores, are formed. Chain formation dominates the
sporulation picture in culture. The pattern is of the
initial conidium on a primary conidiophore giving rise to
1-3 secondary conidiophores from which solitary conidia or
chains of 2-6 develop. The 50X appearance is of irregu-
larly branched sporulation groups of up to 8-12 dark, ovoid
conidia connected by very conspicuous, narrow, often quite
long secondary conidiophores.#Description*]

[@Conidia produced in culture (PCA, V-8) are broadly
ellipsoid or ovoid; enlarge to ca. 50-70 x 20-23 µm, al-
though the bulk of fully developed conidia are near the
lower end of this range; have as many as 8-11 complete or
partial transverse septa, of which 3-5 are darker and
thicker than others, and 0-5 longitudinal septa in the
broadest transverse divisions. Conidia are medium chestnut
brown with the color intensified in edge-view septa.#Description*]

[@Conidium walls are constricted at most of the transepta,
and smooth or very minutely punctulate or eventually
distinctly rough in age.#Description*]

[@Secondary conidiophores arise from otherwise unal-
tered terminal cells as well as from any other cell of the
spore body, with the transition between conidium and new
conidiophore abrupt and well defined. Secondary conidio-
phores may be simple or geniculate and conidiogenous at 2-3
loci; they are medium brown, distinctly septate, and
variable in size to at least 150 x Sym.#Description*]

he considered normal for species of Septosporium. The
correct orientation of the broad-based conidium to conidio-

the basal pore usually is difficult to see within the
contour of the thick, dark conidium wall.#Description*]

representatives of the A. cheiranthi species-group. They

2-3 of the primary septa. No secondary conidiophores are
evident on conidia examined from the field type. External
walls are relatively thick, dark, and minutely ornamented.
Conidiophores are thick-walled, closely septate, simple or
2-3 geniculate, and often up to ca. 100 x 8 µm. Alternaria
instipitata is not known to me in culture or in other

[@Alternaria radicina, associated originally and now
traditionally with a semi-dry black rot of carrot crown and
root, has been studied, described, and illustrated almost
entirely from cultured isolates or from seeds held under
damp-chamber conditions. However, notices of the fungus on
carrot and other apiaceous hosts (parsley, celery, celeri-
ac, parsnip) are arguable if a report is based on black-rot
field or storage lesions rather than on microscopic evalua-
tion of the fungus present, as is discussed below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are very few voucher specimens extant with
putative A. radicina sporulation in place on infected
carrot roots. These few, along with available cultures or
conserved dried specimens of them, give a broader picture
of the kinds of alternarioid morphologies associated with
the taxon name and the black-rot condition than the origi-
nal phytopathology and taxonomy research paper of Meier,
Drechsler, and Eddy (1922) and an early pertinent paper by
Lauritzen (1926) would lead us to expect.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The only material of A. radicina that appears to have
a connection contemporary with the two 1920's studies is
isolate ATCC 6503 (EGS 03-145), which originated with J. I.
Lauritzen: “Lauritzen . . . or Eddy probably found the
first specimen of this fungus on carrots. [Lauritzen] . .
. was closely associated with Meier and Drechsler. #6503
can safely be assumed to have been derived from the type
specimen of the fungus." (in litt. ATCC Director F. A.
Weiss to E.G.S., January 1957).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ATCC 6503 earlier had been strain 5350 at BPI, USDA,
Beltsville, Maryland, which "years ago . . . operated the
Fungus Section of the American Type Culture Collection. . .
. I believe that the original type culture [of A. radicina]
is involved." (in litt. J. A. Stevenson, National Fungus
Collections, BPI, to E.G.S., December 1956).#Misc-exposition*]

[@My approaches to Stevenson and Weiss followed an
opinion of Drechsler that "it seems very probable that no
material of the species was deposited anywhere. My own
participation in the description [including the original
type illustrations] of the fungus was limited to observa-
tions made on pure cultures in 1921. . . . Had the 'type'
concept of species then [1922] prevailed in Mycology, Meier
or Eddy would almost certainly have placed abundantly
sporulating carrot material either in the herbarium at
Washington or in the herbarium of the New York Botanical
Garden" (in litt. C. Drechsler to E.G.S. December 1955).#Misc-exposition*]

[@To clarify the historical record and the secondhand
information on the existence of type or ex-type A. radici-
na, it is noted that the type work reported in 1922 was
carried out partly in USDA Washington, D.C., laboratories
and partly in the laboratory of the Brooklyn Botanic
Garden, Brooklyn, N.Y. (Meier et al., 1922). No pertinent
field specimen has been found in NY or in BKL (BKL now
incorporated in BPI). This leaves only the Lauritzen-
related isolate as problematically related to the original
cooperative studies and to Drechsler's contribution of the#Misc-exposition*]

[@type description and illustrations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ATCC 6503 (Lauritzen) remains in stable condition
and, importantly after 70 years, produces conidia whose
form, color, septation, and dimensions are the same as
those described by the original authors. These facts allow
us to designate a dried-down culture preparation of this
isolate as neotype of Alternaria radicina Meier et al.,
deposited in BPI (EGS 03-145).  Lectotypification is ruled
out because no original material is known to have been
conserved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type description, based on cultures, speaks of
straight, clavate, ellipsoid, obovoid, or turbinate conidia
borne closely, successively, and singly in a clump of 2-3
at the apex of conidiophores of variable lengths or tardily
in short chains of 2 conidia. Conidia are light to dark
brown to dark olivaceous, 3-8 transversely septate, mostly
1-, infrequently 2-longiseptate in all but basal and apical
segments, 34-51 x 10-22 µm.#Description*]

[@In view of the considerable variation in morphology,
particularly conidium size and chain formation, of conidia
in conserved and living material discussed in the A.
radicina literature (e.g., Groves and Skolko 1944; Neer-
gaard 1945; M. B. Ellis 1971), it is noteworthy that the
type authors included observations on conidia produced on
at least three different culture media, viz., carrot
tissue, potato-dextrose agar, and tap water agar. Conidia
developed on carrot reached a range of 34-51 x 17-20 µm; on
tap water approximately as on carrot, with a maximum of 64
x 22 µm; on pda "spores usually measure considerably less."
Cultures on carrot and pda did not produce chains; those on
tap water agar sometimes produced chains of 2 conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neergaard (1945, p. 343) points out a disconcerting
discrepancy between the type description conidium lengths
(max. 5lum, up to 64 µm on tap water agar) and the 80 µm
length of the longest conidium in Drechsler's illustration,
as calculated from the specified enlargement of 535X. A
modern working concept of the taxon is weakened when the
original authors give a maximum conidium length of 51-64 µm
(depending on medium), Neergaard gives lengths up to 75 µm
(but does not illustrate any longer than 63 µm), Groves and
Skolko (1944) cite and illustrate a maximum of 73 µm, and M.
B. Ellis (1971) gives and illustrates a maximum of 57 µm.
My own measurement of Slum max. for ex-neotype conidia
(PCA) matches Drechsler's on carrot.#Misc-exposition*]
[@97#Page-header*]

[@These differences cannot be explained without resort
to parallel cultures from all authors, which now is not
possible. The customary explanation, viz., differences in
substrates, culture conditions and media, is justifiable in
part but not entirely, for there exist isolates from carrot
black rot other than the ex-neotype that also have conidia
in the small size range seen in the type (e.g., Schol-
Schwarz's CBS 109.58; EGS 16-062). Equally reassuring as
to the validity of the type measurements is the fact that
mature conidia in my own cultures ex-neotype (PCA, 10 days)
reach a maximum range of 40-51 x 13-17 µm. Since my
measurements are so nearly the same as those of the type
authors, it seems to me that Neergaard's perceived discrep-
ancy between Drechsler's direct measurements and those of
his illustration is more likely an error in  reduc-
tion/enlargement calculations in publication than a
miscalibration of his microscope ocular scale.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While retaining the original concept of A. radicina
as presented in the Meier et al. paper and illustration and
supported by the extant ex-neotype culture, it is essential
to emphasize that "maximum conidium size" in Alternaria can
be a misleading species character. This is especially true
unless a high percentage of conidia in a mature colony
(plate colony growth practically ended) actually reach the
maximum range so frequently used in strain and species
comparisons.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For A. radicina, the maximum lengths cited by several
authors (as above) actually represent a minute portion of
the conidium population. The dominant mature conidium form
and size in all identifiable isolates known to me are
broadly ellipsoid or ovoid, 42-50 x 18-25 µm (1/w 2.0-2.3),
rather than the exceptional, more narrowly ellipsoid ones,
50-63 x 15-20 µm (1/w 3.0-3.3), that can be found only in
small numbers in the most stable modern isolates of the
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The dominant spore form of A. radicina, as illus-
trated by the several authors cited, yields 1/w ratios near
2.0 (Groves and Skolko), 2.0 (Neergaard), and 1.8 (Ellis).
These are the spore form and proportions that confront the
eye in a slide mount, not the maximum-length examples,
which must be searched for. (NB: sporulation on V-8
colonies has a greater conidium length range, up to ca. 75-
80 µm, than is found on PCA under the same growth condi-
tions.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ex-neotype isolate of A. radicina, although it#Misc-exposition*]
[@98#Page-header*]

[@remains culturally stable and still produces conidia
identical with those of the type description, is not a good
representative of the taxon as it is known in numerous
isolates from black rot tissue and from carrot seeds.
Drechsler (in litt. cit.) remarks that "the fungus produced
spores on agar plates very sparingly." This poverty of
sporulation, mostly on aerial hyphae, continues in current
cultures ex-neotype, in marked contrast to the very abun-
dant surface and aerial sporulation of all the more recent
isolates at hand.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An excellent representative isolate, which is cultur-
ally stable and strongly conidial, is EGS 39-001, isolated
March 1987 from packeted carrot seed that originated in
France.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This and other stable isolates produce essentially no
non-sporulating hyphae above the agar surface. Abundant
but uncrowded, erect conidiophores originate in a radiating
network of well-defined subsurface and surface hyphae.
Conidiophore length is variable, generally ca. 20-80 µm, but
also in the 200-300 µm range, and even reaching many multi-
ples of 100 µm when they elongate into an aerial network.
Simple or branched conidiophores of short to medium length
generate solitary apical conidia or, very commonly, clumps
of single conidia at 2-4 closely geniculate, almost knobby
apical extensions. Production of a secondary conidium,
forming a chain, is so rare in PCA colonies (ca. 10d) as to
seem an aberration (perhaps only 1 per slide mount of
1000's).#Misc-exposition*]

[@An open aerial network of dark hyphae forms well
above the surface sporulation. These aerial hyphae are
fertile, indeed sometimes, perhaps always, are simply very
long arching surface conidiophores that entangle into an
aerial pseudo-network. Short lateral conidiophores arise
at well-separated intervals on aerial hyphae; each usually
bears a single spore, with 2-3 being exceptional.#Description*]

[@Conidia initially are short ellipsoid or ovoid. As
is true with many dictyosporic hyphomycetes (Alternaria,
Stemphylium, Ulocladium), conidium enlargement follows two
different patterns, with full development either relatively
long and narrow or relatively short and broad. In A.
radicina the population of short-broad, ovoid or obovoid
conidia far outnumbers the percentage of longest, narrower
spores. A noteworthy character of large numbers of ini-
tially ellipsoid conidia is subsequent median or supramedi-
an enlargement that results in an obovoid shape rather than#Description*]

brown, 20-175 x 10-12 µm. Juvenile conidia are short-
ellipsoid, becoming broad-ovoid at the 3-4-transeptate
stage (ca. 30-45 x 18-25 µm) with conspicuously thick walls
and transepta throughout development. Mature conidia
retain a broadly ovoid or ellipsoid, erostrate shape,

most of the transverse segments, are ca. 50-60 x 25-38 µm
for a large percentage of conidia with 5-7 transepta, and
ca. 90-100 x 30-37 µm for an equally large percentage that
reach the highest degree of septation. Conidia appear
smooth at all stages of development; color deepens from
initial clear yellowish brown to medium tawny brown with
most transverse and some longitudinal septa a dense brown.#Description*]

[@Most conidia remain solitary, but others produce 1-
few secondary conidiophores from lateral or basal, occa-

study of A. radicina (1922) that they had not succeeded in
finding natural infections of that species on carrot
foliage in the numerous fields available to them. Artifi-
cial inoculations of leaves were successful and devastat-
ing, but examination of extensively collected, naturally
wilted and yellowed leaves invariably yielded the very
different filament-beaked "Macrosporium carotae Ellis &
Langlois" (= Alternaria dauci (Kéhn) Groves & Skolko).#Misc-exposition*]

Daucus carota L. (Queen Anne’s lace) except for one of my

America. The report, however, is in error, in that a
fungus (EGS 26-010) easily isolated from wilted brown
leaves, though of the erostrate-conidium species-group, is
in hindsight a distinguishable taxon, proposed here as a

entiation of A. carotiincultae from other taxa of the
species-group, particularly from somewhat similar A.
radicina, thus depends on characters of sporulation pattern
and conidia.#Description*]

[@Chain formation involving 2-3(-4) conidia is wide-
spread throughout A. carotiincultae cultures and is easily
detectable at 50X. Secondary conidia typically are gener-
ated from secondary conidiophores so short as to be little
more than sporogenous sites in otherwise undifferentiated
apical cells or, at most, morphologically detectable
structures 1-4(-5) x 2-3 µm. In contrast, production of
secondary conidia in stable isolates of A. radicina is
extremely rare.#Description*]

[@Conidia of A. carotiincultae are either ovoid, 40-60
x 20-23 µm, with 5-7 transepta and 1-3(-4) longisepta in
some segments, or ellipsoid, 65-80 x 15-20 µm, with 8-11
transepta and 1-2(-3) longisepta in some of the transverse
segments. They darken from a translucent yellowish brown
to a medium dull brown, have smooth walls, and are dis-
tinctly constricted at several well-defined, slightly
darker primary transepta.#Description*]

[@Conidia of A. carotiincultae show practically no
tendency to become obovoid, i.e., with mature width greater
above the middle, as is characteristic of a high percentage
of A. radicina conidia. A. petroselini conidia, although
they may to a limited extent reach maximum lengths equal to
those of A. carotiincultae, typically and in more recent
representative cultures are mostly broadly ovoid or ellip-
soid in lengths well below the maximum found in a colony.
In contrast, A. carotiincultae conidium populations have a
high percentage of long ovoid to long obclavate conidia at
or near the maximum length range, along with the accompany-
ing high percentage of mature, shorter ovoid spores.#Description*]

an Alternaria pathogen of parsley cultivars (Petroselinum

both taxa in the genus Stemphylium, as indicated above in
the synonymy for A. petroselini. Primary diagnostic

in experimental inoculations and a perception of A.
petroselini as generally having somewhat larger spores than
A. radicina.#Misc-exposition*]

extant. Both are from seed of rooted parsley (P. crispum
'Tuberosum') and are, I believe, of the same taxon, al-
though the type dates from December 1940 and the isolate
from April 1941.  Conidia of the type (Fig. 103) are all
short-broad ovoid to subsphaeroid, max. 47 µm long. These
would yield relatively little information as to their
possible identity with or distinctness from isolates from
other sources were it not for the Neergaard isolate (Fig.

the subsphaeroid of the type (1/w - 1.4) to the longer
ellipsoid emphasized in the type description and illustra-

seen in mature cultures of A. radicina, the conidium

short-broad elliptical to subsphaeroid spores. The kind of
relatively long-ellipsoid conidia emphasized in Neergaard's
illustration and discussion constitutes a prominent portion
only of initial sporulation in young cultures (PCA, ca. 5d)
of the small-spored isolate; these are lost in the crowd as
the strongly dominant mature conidium shape becomes short-
broad in cultures at ca. 10-14d.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The information presented by Neergaard for isolates
from parsley cultivars suggests a possibility that he was
handling two different taxa, a preponderantly small-spored
species, as in the type of A. petroselini, and a second
species with larger conidia (see Alt.T&V 129, A. selini,
below). Comparison of other available specimens and
isolates from parsley supports this suggestion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I have seen only two other isolates readily identifi-
able with Neergaard's typical material of A. petroselini.
One was isolated by J. W. Groves from California-grown
parsley seed (DAOM 42-I-356A; EGS 09-159). The second was
isolated from rot of a parsley petiole base growing in
California (L. Davis no. 135; EGS 12-162).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As indicated above, conidia of the type specimen of
A. petroselini are broadly ovoid to subsphaeroid, reaching
28-47 x 16-35 µm (mature l/w = ca. 1.2-1.4), with 3-4
complete or partial transverse septa, 2-4 longisepta in
broadest segments, and 1 longitudinal or oblique septum in
either or both of the rounded end segments. Conidia appear
smooth and are a medium dull yellow-brown (after years
inlactic acid mount). There is no evidence of secondary
conidium production in the material examined.#Description*]

[@Conidia in young (PCA, 5d) cultures of A. petroselini
exhibit the full range of size and shape found on PCA;
longer growth periods affect only relative quantities of
different shapes. About half the young population develops
along the ovoid-subsphaeroid path to shapes about the same
as those of the type, though somewhat smaller (a size
difference commonly characteristic of heavily sporulating
cultures of Alternaria), 35-38 x 20-24 µm (1/w = ca. 1.5);
the other half develops in a long-ellipsoid pattern to
shapes not found in the type, 50-62(-66) x 20-26 µm (l/w =
ca. 2.53.3).#Description*]

are predominantly ovoid-subsphaeroid, with long-ellipsoid
spores present in very small numbers. Upper size ranges
and l/w ratios of the two spore shapes are essentially the
same as those noted for young cultures. Septation of
ovoid-subsphaeroid conidia has the same pattern as that of
the type; long-ellipsoid conidia become 6-9 transeptate
with 1-3 longisepta in about half to all but the basal
segment. A primary conidium with a l-celled apical conid-
iophore is seen very rarely. Most mature conidia appear
quite smooth, sometimes punctulate, and a rather dull
medium brown, with septa darker and well defined but not
thicker than the outer wall.#Description*]

[@Conidium populations of A. petroselini are dominated
by short-ovoid to subsphaerical spores; long-ellipsoid

percentage of the population in maturing cultures. Just
the opposite holds true for A. selini, with long-ellipsoid,
ovoid, or obclavate conidia always dominant in a population
that matures with a low percentage of short-ovoid to sub-
sphaeroid spores.#Misc-exposition*]

long ovoid, beakless, and with a good degree of lateral
symmetry when young. Maturing conidia almost always are
strongly constricted at most of their transverse septa and
typically retain lateral symmetry or, in some isolates,
have several cells that are variously swollen. Conidia are
smooth and medium tawny or cinnamon brown in color when
young and may remain so or only slightly darker throughout

[@The Crouan (1867) species apparently requires neotyp-
ification, in that the only pertinent specimen found in
their herbarium at Concarneau (with manuscript description
and good drawings) is noted as "sur les tiges mortes du
Smyrnium olusatrum. hiv. Print. p.c. (vv)," whereas the
published description reads "sur les tiges mortes de
Smyrnium olusatrum, sous le cháteau de Brest. Aut. p.c."
If the abbreviations can be shown to refer to the same
specimen (I believe not), then neotypification would become
superfluous. In the absence of known additional specimens,
the single extant specimen noted above is chosen as neotype
of the original name and taxon (CO; EGS 30-028).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The history of genus name changes for this taxon,
morphologically striking both in nature and in culture,
attests to the difficulty hyphomycetologists have had in
defining and circumscribing members of the erostrate-
conidium species-group of Alternaria, to which A. smyrnii
belongs. The label of the Crouan neotype actually reads
"Septosporium smyrnii" (never published in this form),
along with a manuscript description that is essentially the
same as the published type description of Helminthosporium
smyrnii. Saccardo's material of the same taxon (PAD; EGS
11-195) was assigned first to Stemphylium, then to Macro-
sporium, and finally (correctly) to Alternaria, as indi-
cated in the synonymy above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus occurs in effuse black patches on old
stalks of alexanders (Smyrnium olus-atrum L.), an apiaceous
herb formerly used like celery. Both the type and excel-
lent modern living material (EGS 37-093, sent by M. B.
Ellis in 1984) are on this host. The species also occurs
in abundance on old stalks of cow-parsley (Anthiscus
sylvestris (L.) Hoffm.) (IMI 1276; EGS 22-012) and on
parsley (Petroselinum crispum) in Saccardo's type of Stem-

[@Extensive black field colonies of A. smyrnii are (at
50X) composed of open to dense thickets of erect, rigid,
shiny black, setose conidiophores. At higher magnifi-
cations, these conidiophores are seen to be very dark
brown, thick-walled, and closely septate, arising singly or
more often in clumps from enlarged, rough, cellular bases
or from multicellular sclerotia. They range from 200-300 µm#Description*]
[@120#Page-header*]

[@to well over 500 µm long x ca. 11-25 µm wide; they often are
conidiogenous at well-separated geniculate sites or from
several short, closely consecutive apical cells.#Description*]

[@Conidia in the field type are ovoid, with 7-8
slightly constricting, well-defined but not thickened
transepta and 1-3 longisepta in a few to most of the
transverse segments, up to ca. 64-96 x 24-27 µm, pale to
medium yellowish brown, and smooth. Occasional short, 1-
celled apical secondary conidiophores are evidence that
chains, probably very short, are produced.#Description*]

[@An excellent isolate of the species from “animal
feeding stuff," U.K., has been available for many years
(IMI 115988; EGS 27-177); and an even better one was
isolated from a 1984 M. B. Ellis specimen (EGS 37-093) on
Smyrnium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The appearance of A. smyrnii cultures (PCA 5-10d) is
similar to that of other members of the A. cheiranthi
species-group. Short to long erect conidiophores originate
at or beneath the agar surface, sometimes as distinguish-
able individuals in a close turf of sporulating structures
and often as clumps arising from conspicuous knots or
sclerotial growths of very dark cells formed within or on
the agar substrate. Free-standing conidiophores are ca.
100-600 (or often much more) x 3-7 µm, dilute yellow-tan,
with conidiogenous branches at various levels. The longest
conidiophores arch and entangle, forming a loose pseudo-
network above the colony.  Conidiophores that originate in
sclerotial knots do not develop through to spore production
within ca. 2 weeks of active culture, but eventually do so.#Description*]

[@Conidia produced in culture are ovoid (as in field
specimens), sometimes obovoid, or to a high percentage
narrowly ovoid or ellipsoid, with 7-8 transverse septa in
largest ovoid spores, up to 10 transepta in narrowly ellip-
soid spores, and 1-2 longisepta in a few of the transverse
segments. Ovoid and obovoid conidia reach a size range of
ca. 40-58 x 18-22 µm and the narrower ellipsoid ones, which
dominate the population, ca. 67-96 x 13-16 µm. Conidia are
smooth, occasionally punctulate, and medium brown in color.
Chains of 2 conidia occur commonly, with the generating
secondary conidiophore usually a single short cell or
sometimes nothing more than a slight apical, aseptate
swelling with an apical conidiogenous site.#Description*]

[@XVIII. THE ALTERNARIA BRASSICICOLA SPECIES-GROUP#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria brassicicola (Schweinitz) Wiltshire (1947)
exhibits sufficiently distinctive characters that it rarely
would be misidentified with other small-spore, long-chain
species when examined microscopically from culture.
Conidial chains proliferate rapidly, sometimes with as many
as 20+ conidia in linear progression with only minor 1-2-
conidium side branches. More characteristically, however,
the sporulation apparatus (viewed at 50X) has much the same
habit on PCA and V-8 as does A. alternata, i.e., the
pattern is of a short to moderate length, solitary, erect
conidiophore supporting long, freely branching chains in an
open, bushy growth of 50-60+ conidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@123#Page-header*]

[@The most striking characters of the conidia are the
deep rich chestnut brown color of the conidium wall and
septa (as seen in edge view), the predominantly short
cylindrical or truncate-conoid, l-celled secondary conidio-
phores (lighter in color than the othervise beakless spore
body and sometimes induced to sporulate so quickly that a
basal septum is not formed), the consistently moderate
amount of constriction at dark septa, and the absence of
longitudinal septa in an extremely high percentage of the
conidium population.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As to similar species, Neergaard recognized (1942a)
and described (1945) Alternaria resedae Neerg. on and
isolated from Reseda odorata L. He considered and illus-
trated it as being similar to A. brassicicola but separable
from it in some details of morphology and pathogenicity.

conidia in the type specimen cannot be distinguished from
those in young field specimens of A. brassicicola.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examination of a few dozen isolates referable to the
A. brassicicola species-group has yielded only a few that

[@Conidia are borne in long chains, usually with the
initial few spores strikingly larger than subsequent
secondary spores, which tend to be progressively smaller as
the chain lengthens. Young unbranched chains may have 10-
20 spore units. Usually, however, multiple branching of
primary conidiophores and chains is a dominant character,
resulting in loose tufts of 50-60 or more conidia.#Description*]

[@Conidia in individual sporulation tufts (on PCA) are
narrowly ovoid or ellipsoid in the larger initial units,
then progressively broader ovoid, then smaller ovoid in
terminal regions of the chain. Initial conidia have a size
range of ca. 50-60 x 12-l7 µm and 6-7 transepta with 0-1
longiseptum in a few segments; intermediate ovoid spores
ca. 30-40 x 15-18 µm and 4-5 transepta with 0-2 longisepta
in a few segments; smaller ovoid spores ca. 10-25 x 6-10 µm
and 1-3 transepta with no longisepta.#Description*]

[@No individual conidium has a true beak. The terminal
conidium in any chain has a rounded apex. All other
conidia, in both nature and culture, have an apical conid-
iogenous structure which usually is a l-cell secondary
conidiophore ca. 5 x 5 µm, but which also frequently is a
smaller, similar outgrowth lacking a septum to separate it
from the spore body. (Secondary conidiophore measurements
are not included in conidium dimensions given above.)#Description*]

[@The spore body of conidia of all sizes (except of the
youngest) is a medium yellowish to reddish brown in face
view; the apical secondary conidiophore is a dilution of

[@Neergaard's differentiation criteria, as applied to
his illustrations (1945), may support his concept of a
second species morphologically similar to but distinguish-
able from A. brassicicola. He mentioned differences in
spore color, longitudinal symmetry, and apical taper, with
A. resedae conidia paler and more asymmetrical than those
of A. brassicicola, and gradually tapering into a 1-2-
celled cylindrical secondary conidiophore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The portions of the purported A. resedae type speci-
men and ex-type culture that I have seen have little
morphological resemblance to the type description. Some of
Neergaard's "type specimens," deposited at the Veterinary

paper disks bearing several seeds that had been held under
incubator conditions; fungus growths from different seeds
on the same disk sometimes are macroscopically different.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type preparation of A. resedae is ca. 20 seeds of
Reseda odorata on filter paper (CP; EGS 11-063). Some Al-
ternaria conidia were found in dark growth near some seeds,
but they are not a good match for the type description. An
isolate shared with me in 1954 as CBS 115.44 Alternaria
resedae (EGS 07-030) arrived with the CBS information
"single spore isolation from seeds of Reseda odorata, 8-10-
41; 1944 sent by Neergaard; no spores at time of arrival."
Manipulation of substrate and light conditions induced
production of a few conidia, but neither the growth nor the
spores are near enough Neergaard's description to be
reliable as a type foundation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neergaard was very familiar with the characteristics
and pathology of A. brassicicola (which he called A.
circinans). He considered the conidia of A. resedae and A.
brassicicola to have "a rather strong resemblance," an
opinion that is supported by his illustrations. Although
he qualified the resemblance by listing several differen-
tial characters, it remains necessary that any identifiable
collection or isolate of A. resedae must look very much
like A. brassicicola. The conidia that I have seen from
the "type" specimen and from an ex-type culture are not
convincingly useful for characterizing the taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@XIX.  ALTERNARIA BRASSICAE, "THE CABBAGE MACROSPORIUM,"
21 OF ITS SYNONYMS, PLUS SELECTED MISDETERMINATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The abundance of names that can be established as
synonyms of Macrosporium brassicae Berk. (1836) reached its
maximum, we can hope, when Wiltshire (1947) surveyed the
30+ names and available type specimens associated with
Alternaria species reported to occur on _ brassicaceous
hosts. No Berkeley specimen of the taxon is known to
exist. (For formal neotypification see Alt. Chronology
1836.) The original description (l.c., p. 339) reads:
"M.[acrosporium. Fr.] Brassicae, Berk. (cabbage Macrospori-
um); flocci obsolete, sporidia clavate antennaeform 5-11-
septate rather longer than the peduncle. On decaying
cabbage leaves amongst Cladosporium herbarum. King's
Cliffe, Norths. Rev. M. J. Berkeley." Or interpreted in
part: conidia long narrow obclavate, 5-1ll-septate, the
conidium body somewhat longer than the beak portion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire (1.c.) deduced that this name and descrip-
tion apply to the longest-spored species of Alternaria
known to occur on Brassica species; he gave no specific
reasons for the decision. I consider his choice support-
able and the correct name for the fungus to be Alternaria
brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (1880c), because of the single
character "conidium body somewhat longer than the beak."
The 5-11 septa and the long narrow appearance of the coni-
dia, as given in the type description, could apply to
conidia in field material of both A. brassicae and A.
brassicicola; however, the very long conidia of A. brassi-
cae usually include a robust, apically tapered, poorly
septate portion that constitutes about 1/3 of the total
spore length, whereas conidia of A. brassicicola have no
definable beak region except when short, usually 1-celled#Misc-exposition*]
[@132#Page-header*]

[@secondary conidiophores develop during the process of chain
proliferation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The difference between A. brassicae and A. brassi-
cicola was established definitively by Wiltshire. Two
other pathogens of Brassicaceae, A. cheiranthi (Lib.) Bolle
(1924; Alt.T&V 123) and A. japonica Yoshii (1941; Alt.T&V
130) (syn. A. raphani Groves & Skolko [1944]), also are
fairly well understood on the basis of modern illustrations
and descriptions. These four species encompass a high
percentage of the 60+ names that have been published for
phaeodictyosporic species on brassicaceous plants. But
they do not account for all of them; and most particularly
they do not account for the minimally characterized species
that Saccardo misinterpreted when he catalogued and devised
a description for "Macrosporium brassicae Berk." in his
Sylloge Fungorum (vol. 4, 1886).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wiltshire went far toward explaining and assigning
blame for a taxonomic situation that has led to the exis-
tence of about 30 names assignable as synonyms to Alter-
naria brassicae and A. brassicicola. He regretted Saccar-
do's errors in particular; but he failed to note that
Saccardo's most significant error, involving M. brassicae
Berk., actually originated in England with M. C. Cooke
(1877), who had illustrated two comparatively small Alter-
naria(?) conidia and had misidentified them as M. brassicae
Berk. in his paper "On Black Moulds."#Misc-exposition*]

[@This historical disquisition needs to continue
somewhat on this point in order to sort out Saccardo's pre-
cedents and subsequent handling of relevant names in the
period 1880-1886 and to set a basis for defending the
extensive synonymy presented below.#Misc-exposition*]

(1947, p.1): "There are two species of Alternaria found on
species of Brassica which are confused more than any other
two species in this genus." The post-Saccardo confusion,
however, was of names, not of the two fungi themselves,
which we now refer to as A. brassicae and A. brassicicola.
The name-jugglers who followed Saccardo were for the most
part clear on the two species they thought were involved,
but they were still struggling as late as 1945 (Jerstad)
and 1958 and 1959 (Sawada) to come to terms with the
Saccardo (1880c, 1886) handling of names, particularly of
the entity "Macrosporium brassicae Berk.," which lacked
reference specimens, authentic illustrations, and a defini-
tive type description.#Misc-exposition*]
[@133#Page-header*]

[@The central clue to resolution of this muddle is the
fact that Saccardo believed he was cataloging and charac-
terizing three, not just the generally assumed two, differ-
ent species of Alternaria/Macrosporium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. Saccardo at first reported (1880b; Michelia 2:
129) on material that he identified as Macrosporium brassi-
cae Berk., with conidia 120-140 x 20-25 µm, 6-8-septate, and
queried "An Alternariae species?" In 1886 (Syll. 4: 546)
he referred to this 1880 source in establishing A. brassi-
cae (Berk.) Sacc. var. macrospora Sacc. The specimen
itself, "In foliis Brassicae oleraceae. Mb. [Malbranche],"
came from Rouen, France; it is the holotype of A. brassicae
var. macrospora Sacc. (PAD; EGS 38-158). Saccardo's
conidium measurements match those of the most abundant
conidia present but not of the scarce largest ones, some of
which are as long as 170-200 µm. The fungus is typical
large-spored A. brassicae as we now interpret the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. Saccardo soon thereafter (1880c; Michelia 2: 172)
also introduced Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. [var.]
*minor Sacc., with conidia 60-80 x 14-18 µm, 6-8-septate,
and supported the concept with a good illustration (1881,
Fungi italici del. 736) that is recognizable as what we now
call A. brassicicola. In 1886 (Syll. 4: 546) this variety
"minor" disappeared in favor of simply A. brassicae (Berk.)
Sacc. (the information is the same in both places). As
late as 1914 Saccardo wrote the name A. brassicae on
herbarium specimen labels of the smaller-spored taxon that
we now know as A. brassicicola, e.g., on a collection
labeled "Funghi di Malta no. 573, legit Caruana Gatto"
(PAD; EGS 11-118). The enormous influence of Saccardo and
the Sylloge Fungorum spread this specific error worldwide.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. In 1886 (Syll. vol.4) Saccardo compiled three
names immediately pertinent to this review. Macrosporium
brassicae Berk. (Syll. 4: 526) was given the meager charac-
terization used by Berkeley (1836) plus the dimensions of
conidia illustrated and labeled "Macrosporium Brassicae
Berk., from Britain" by M. C. Cooke in his paper "On Black
Moulds" (1877, Pl. 26, fig. 21). The conidium dimensions
were calculated from Cooke's figure as 50-60 x 12-l4 µm.
Saccardo duly noted the two sources of his information as
"...Berk. in Sm.[ith's] Engl. Fl. V, p. 339, [and] Cooke
Black Moulds t. XXVI, f. 21." (This two-source concept has
no taxonomic meaning and no nomenclatural standing; Cooke's
small-spored species, known only through his illustration
of two conidia, is unidentifiable today.) Saccardo's mis-
guided idea of M. brassicae Berk. as having such small,#Misc-exposition*]
[@134#Page-header*]

[@solitary conidia gave him the opportunity to use a second
name Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (Syll. 4: 546) for
a different species with chains of conidia of moderate size
("60-80 x 14-18 µm," now attributed to A. brassicicola), and
a third name A. brassicae var. macrospora Sacc. (Syll. 4:
546) for yet another species with larger conidia ("120-140
x 20-25 µm," now attributed to A. brassicae). Saccardo's
act of using a name for one fungus and a new combination
derived from it for a second one is unthinkable now in ICBN
terms and extraordinary if not unprecedented even in 1886.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In presenting these three entries, it escaped Saccar-
do that Macrosporium herculeum Ell. & G. Martin (Sacc.
Syll. 4: 526) and Polydesmus exitiosus (Kühn) Kühn (Sacc.
Syll. 4: 402) might be pertinent to his Alternaria/Macro-
sporium listings on Brassica, which is not surprising,
given the unserviceable nature of the Berkeley and Cooke
guidance on Macrosporium brassicae Berk.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Today A. brassicae and A. brassicicola are understood
and correctly attributed largely through studies by Bolle
(1924) and Wiltshire (1947). The original source of the
mischief-making Cooke/Saccardo misconcept of Macrosporium
brassicae Berk. now is clear and can be ignored in the
future. The nature of A. brassicae var. macrospora Sacc.
is defined by the Malbranche specimen (cited above) whose
conidia, in Saccardo's experience, were the largest of the
group and, in fact, are of typical A. brassicae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(A parting thought: there is nothing unusual in being
able to isolate 4-5 distinct species of Alternaria from
single autumn-chilled Brassica leaves, including A. bras-
sicae, A. brassicicola, A. japonica, and 2-3 representa-
tives of the A. alternata, A. tenuissima, and A. infectoria

[@Alternaria brassicae is a striking, very frequent
component of the fungus flora of many unprotected brassi-
caceous crops, particularly of common head cabbage grown
under cool, moist climatic conditions. Under optimum
sporulation conditions leaf lesions may be covered with a
solid stand of relatively large, sturdy-beaked conidia.#Description*]

[@In nature, juvenile conidia ca. 60-85 x 13-15 µm have
3-6 transverse septa and at this stage already are develop-
ing from a narrowly ovoid, almost ellipsoid form into a
narrowly obclavate one as the conidium apex begins pro-
duction of a discernible true beak. The sturdy beak, never
fragile or filamentous, increases in length as the spore
body continues to enlarge and produce additional septa.#Description*]

ex representative field specimen EGS 38-032. Bar = 50 µm.#Figure*]


[@138#Page-header*]

[@Conidia usually are solitary at the conidiogenous
apex of simple or geniculate conidiophores; secondary
conidium production occurs in nature but is not a dominant
character on the natural substrate. Fresh mature conidia
are dilute straw-colored to pale greenish tan; the surface
of fresh, mature but not overdeveloped conidia appears to
be quite smooth.#Description*]

[@The natural conidium population contains spores in
all degrees of long obclavate form, with a high proportion
of mature conidia in the range of 250-300 x 35-40 µm,
commonly with ca. 12 constricting transverse septa and
usually only one longiseptum in a few transverse segments
(or 2 in a few transverse segments of the broadest co-
nidia). The sturdy beak, usually without transverse septa,
commonly makes up about one-fourth to one-third of the
mature spore length.#Description*]

[@The major differences between sporulation usually
found in nature and that developed in culture are that (in
culture) chain formation of 2-3 conidia becomes a dominant
character, strikingly long secondary conidiophores are
produced by a large proportion of conidia, and conidium
color deepens to a medium olivaceous brown. Greatest
conidium body length is about the same in both nature and
culture (ca. 150-200 µm); the sturdy beak typical of field
material is retained in culture, or is replaced by a short
l-celled secondary conidiophore, or is converted into a
sturdy, simple or geniculate secondary conidiophore ca. 5-
8 µm wide and as short as 10 µm or as long as or longer than
the spore body.#Description*]

[@The taxon has been treated especially well in de-
scription and illustration by Wiltshire (1947), who appar-
ently recognized the instructive value of illustrating the
conidial apparatus not only as it occurs in nature but also
as it is influenced by conditions of laboratory culture.
The descriptive treatment of Neergaard (1945) emphasizes
the nature of conidia produced in culture, particularly the
abundance of secondary conidiophores; M. B. Ellis (1971)
emphasizes characters of conidia from natural substrates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@XX. DIGRESSION INTO NIMBYA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sporidesmium scirpicola Fuckel (1863) was the earli-
est of a few taxa described with a combination of conidium
characters suggestive of both Alternaria and Drechslera to
modern students of the group. I found the combination of
characters too miscellaneous for Drechslera and unaccept-
able for Alternaria, and described a new genus Nimbya
Simmons (1989), with N. scirpicola (Fuckel) Simmons as type
and with four additional taxa to bolster a genus concept.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since Nimbya and related taxa once placed in Alter-
naria and Macrosporium were initially discussed elsewhere
than in this series of Alternaria notes, it is convenient,
perhaps helpful, to repeat the generic characterization
below and to add some notes and a few more species here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the taxa originally assigned to Nimbya occur
on species of Cyperaceae and Juncaceae (Carex, Eleocharis,
Juncus, Scirpus). Only N. gomphrenae (Togashi) Simmons,
widespread on Gomphrena globosa, was described in the
earlier treatment as occurring on a member of another host
family, the Amaranthaceae. Subsequent search and gifts of
material have yielded additional taxa from genera of Ama-
ranthaceae (Alternanthera, Celosia, Froelichia).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Nimbya have tretic or restrictedly blastic
conidia that are solitary or catenate, long obclavate,
short to long rostrate, and initially distophragmoseptate
becoming rarely, partially, or completely euphragmoseptate.
Longitudinal or oblique partition of a cell lumen occurs
rarely. A striking character is the internal compart-
mentalization of conidia into numerous angular to rounded
cells that are connected by narrow channels through the
surrounding distoseptum matrix. Additionally, known teleo-
morphs of Nimbya are species of ascocarpic Macrospora
Fuckel, a genus markedly different from Alternaria teleo-
morphs in Lewia Barr & Simmons (Simmons 1986).#Misc-exposition*]

spots and new isolates have become available from Florida,
U.S.A., and from Thailand. The Florida isolate deterio-
rated rapidly in serial culture. Several isolates from
Thailand material initially sporulated abundantly on sparse
mycelium under routine culture conditions. Serial trans-
fers have led to even scantier growth and poor sporulation,
with considerable aberration in conidium morphology as
compared with the initial cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidia illustrated with the type description (Toga-
shi 1926) are markedly distoseptate, with up to 12 angular
to rounded lumina separated only rarely by 1-2 transverse
eusepta. Each conidium has a rather stiff narrow beak ca.
0.5-1.0X the length of the conidium body.#Description*]

[@Numerous field specimens examined (Simmons 1989) have
similar conidia with series of well-defined, strongly
angular lumina with narrow connectives and rarely with 1-2
transverse eusepta. Conidia of the type and other sporu-
lating field specimens characteristically are long and
narrow, up to ca. 150-170 x 8-13 µm.#Description*]

[@More recent isolates (Thailand, EGS 40-146) produce
conidia that have a short-broad appearance disconcertingly
different from the usual field spores. Their cell lumina
are broadly octagonal, abutting the conidium outer wall and
each other rather than appearing as linear series of
strongly incised cell units surrounded by a distoseptum
matrix. Only the first flush of conidia on Gomphrena
lesions held overnight in a damp chamber exhibit strongly
angular lumina. This striking character rarely is seen in
conidia from 4-6d PCA cultures.#Description*]

[@Conidia produced in PCA culture are borne singly on
simple erect conidiophores. Juvenile conidia are ovoid to
obclavate to broadly elliptical; interior compartmentaliza-
tion but not euseptation is visible when conidia are no
more than 20 µm long. Development of a narrow, rather stiff
apical beak often begins when a conidium is about 50 µm
long. The spore body of fully developed conidia is ca. 80-
100 x 18-20 µm, the beak ca. 60-80 x 2 µm. The 7-10 compart-
ments in conidia produced in culture appear broadly octago-
nal, reaching the full width of the spore body. Transverse
eusepta may be formed, usually across one or two of the
basal distosepta, then through one or two others. Longitu-
dinal eusepta have not been seen but rarely there is a
vertical or oblique partition, which actually is the
interface of two cells formed by division of one of the#Description*]

conidia with extremely long narrow beaks defined the
isolate as a Nimbya and suggested a possible resemblance to
Alternaria alternantherae on Alternanthera philoxeroides in
Louisiana, U.S.A. The original Louisiana material had been
used up in isolation work, so derivative cultures proved to
be the major link to the type.#Description*]

[@Conidia and their apical beaks, as originally illus-
trated (Holcomb and Antonopoulos 1976), exhibited so many
and various swollen cells that experience suggested inter-
nal parasitism as an explanation. Culture and 1-conidium
reisolation of the ATCC lyophil preparation demonstrated
that the ex-type isolate is culturally unstable (some
sectors of non-sporulating aerial mycelium) but that, after
reisolation, it can produce enormous numbers of conidia
from solid stands of surface conidiophores within 2-4d on
PCA and V-8 agars. The isolate from Australia performs in
essentially the same manner.#Description*]

[@The ex-type reisolates in recent cultures reveal that
the taxon is a typical Nimbya and that conidium and beak
structure and development are considerably more uniform
than initial type illustrations indicate. Certainly the
kinds of swollen, euseptate conidium cells originally
photographed can be found. But they tend to gain promi-

angular and well separated in the Australian field mate-

transverse septa, distinct from lumen interfaces, are rare

PCA); 2-3 eusepta can be found in conidia from colonies
about 2 wks old. Conidium bodies become as large as 80-115

nal, for intermittent renewal of beak growth often results
in 5-6 successive regions of narrow beak interrupted by a
series of apical swellings, each delimited by a septum in
the long beak. Rare chains of two conidia can be seen at

40-60 x 2 µm, giving a total length of ca. 150 µm or more
(beaks of largest conidia sometimes have broken off).
There are as many as 7-9 transverse distosepta, with
eusepta through 1-4 of these. Vertical partition of a cell
lumen is rare but has been seen in as many as 2 transverse
segments of a single conidium. Cells in conidia of medium
size are strongly angular and well separated except for a
narrow channel between adjacent ones; they become octagonal
to fully rounded and crowded as the spore body enlarges.
Conidia are a dilute gold-tan in color, with eusepta
appearing slightly darker in edge view.#Description*]

different from the sort of apparently tretic or porogenic
conidiogenesis found in Alternaria. I have not seen fresh

[@The carrot pathogen now known correctly as Alternaria
dauci was the first taxon of the genus to be described and
differentiated largely on the basis of conidia with long,
narrowly tapered to filiform beaks. Kühn (1855) used the
filamentous beak character to distinguish A. dauci from
another large-spored species known to him which, however,
has conidia gradually tapering into a broad, blunt-tipped
apical region, Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (syn.
Sporidesmium exitiosum Kühn [1855]).#Description*]
[@152#Page-header*]

[@The legitimacy of "dauci" as a species epithet in
Alternaria, instead of the variety or forma specialis
status used by Kühn, Lindau, Bolle, and Neergaard, has a
very flimsy basis in a few words of E. Rostrup (1888):
[transl.] "the fungus is a species of black mold, Macro-
sporium dauci, which was described by Jul. Kühn 30 years
ago, however under another poorly chosen name."#Misc-exposition*]

[@"M.[acrosporium] dauci (Kühn) Rostrup" would have
serious problems of legitimacy as a new combination under
modern ICBN rules, even with the Art. 32 loophole of "indi-
rect reference"; and, being familiar with J. W. Groves'
respect for matters nomenclatorial, I suspect that he
adopted the Rostrup note rather gingerly. In any case,
the name A. dauci (Kühn) Groves & Skolko has been thor-
oughly accepted in the literature for 50 years. It proba-
bly can be justified, if only marginally, within ICBN
rules. I find no reason to reconsider its use.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Use of the next chronologically pertinent name for
the same fungus, A. carotae (Ell. & Langl.) Stevenson &
Wellman (1944), cannot now be justified and probably never
could have been, even with the rather loose ICBN rules of
1944, in that the complete entry reads simply "Daucus

Fungi Rhenani exsiccati no. 2210 (1869) (G; EGS 09-187).
The species has played almost no part in either mycological

fungus having developed in a parasitic mode on elm leaf-
spots is problematic, in that the fungus growth on the
original substrate is a mosaic of Cladosporium, Stem-
phylium, and the plentiful Alternaria.#Misc-exposition*]

collection (G; EGS 09-189) is on diseased beet leaves, but
he also attributes a heart rot condition of red beet
("Herzfaüle der Runkelrüben") to the fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria putrefaciens is morphologically distinct
within Alternaria and readily distinguishable from any
taxon described before 1870. It is the same species as one
present in the exsiccata distributed by Rabenhorst in 1870
under the nomen nudum Macrosporium commune. The Rabenhorst
material is in turn a part of the same collection that M.
C. Cooke (1866) distributed in his Fungi Britannici exsic-

produce a functional secondary conidiophore extension of
the narrow beak. Fully developed conidia reach ca. 80-120

longitudinal or oblique septa in many of the transverse
segments. Conidia are pale yellowish tan, slightly con-
stricted at major septa, and essentially smooth.#Description*]

[@Fuckel described conidia without a stipe, "sine
stipite," as 82 x l6 µm in size. Since the concept of a
spore "stipe" for Alternaria at that time could refer
either to a conidiophore or to a narrow beak (with reversed
orientation), his measurement of 56 µm for a stipe would
bring total conidium length of ca. 138 µm into better accord
with my own observations on a very limited sampling of
conidia with long-tapered true beaks.#Description*]

[@An excellent modern specimen of A. putrefaciens on
leaves of sugar beet was collected by W. G. Bramley in Oct.
1959 in Yorkshire, U.K. (IMI 79075a; EGS 26-042). This
specimen yielded some 11-conidium isolates which, at the
time, sporulated abundantly on potato-dextrose agar. The
plate culture was dried down for IMI herbarium purposes and
not retained in viable condition. I have not seen fresh
material of A. putrefaciens; all of numerous attempts to
find it on lesions of red beet leaves and in outgrowths
from beet seeds held in damp chambers have yielded only
isolates of different taxa of the A. tenuissima and other
small-spored species groups.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternaria putrefaciens now gives us the correct name
for a taxon originally distributed (Rabenhorst 1870) under
a nomen nudum, Macrosporium commune, which was used indis-
criminately for many decades for commonly encountered
Alternaria species of diverse morphology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unfortunately, the name "Macrosporium commune" is as
meaningless as "Alternaria tenuis" and currently, to a
great extent, as "A. alternata," in the way they have been
misused on innumerable specimen packets in herbaria and on
cultures in use all over the world. It is unlikely that
significant numbers of these orphan specimens will be re-
examined and identified in modern times. But it can be
hoped that attempts will be made to differentiate interna-
tional research stocks of misidentified "Alternaria alter-
nata" and other taxa with small to medium-size conidia as
both morphological and molecular data accumulate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomy of a plasmodiophorid intracellular parasite on the
seagrass Halophila stipulacea (Hydrocharitaceae) is discussed. The
observed organism can be attributed to Tetramyxa parasitica Goebel
(Plasmodiophoromycetes) on the basis of a study on cysts and
biflagellate zoospores, observed here for the first time. The infection was
localized in the cells of ellipsoid swellings of the leaf petiole. The cysts
filled the host cells in form of single cells, dyads, triads or four celled
aggregates, surrounded by a wall layer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Halophila stipulacea (Forssk.) Aschers. (Hydrocharitaceae) is a marine
monocot recently recorded along the Southern coasts of Italy (Villari,
1988), after its introduction in the Mediterranean Sea (Lipkin, 1972). The
plant ig common in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean.Specimens of
this plant are in the MS Herbarium, both in form of exsiccata and as
formalin-preserved plants; alterations of the normal morphology of leaf
petioles were occasionally observed in form of ellipsoid swellings. These
were submitted to the senior author two years after collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Similar modifications of the petiolar structure have only seldom been
observed and attributed to the presence of a fungal parasite. In a first
instance, we considered the observed parasite to be Plasmodiophora
halophilae Ferd. et Winge, which, as far as we know, has not been
recorded after its original description in 1913. Originally this fungus was
found on H. ovalis (R. Br.) J.D. Hook., collected along the shores of the
island of Noesa Kembagan, near Java (Ferdinandsen and Winge,
1913).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Further observations on Italian material of the plants allowed to assign
this fungal parasite to the genus Tetramyxa Goebel, the zoospores of#Misc-exposition*]
[@166#Page-header*]

[@which are here reported. It seemed worthwhile to report this finding in
detail.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Individuals of Halophila stipulacea were collected along the East coast
of Sicily at Naxos and Riposto. Voucher samples are filed in MS. Some
specimens were dried and mounted on herbarium sheets, others were
stored in 3% formalin in seawater. Microscopic observations were
carried out with a Leitz Aristoplan with standard optics and Nomarski
interference contrast. To test the viability of the parasite in samples of
dried Halophila after forteen months of being mounted on the herbarium
sheet, two infected petioles were carefully washed in sterile distilled
water and then put in a plate with sterile sea water at room temperature
and dimlight, after minor woundings of the plant tissue. Further aliquots
of seawater were added when necessary.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Attempts to reinfect plants of Halophila with zoospores were carried
out in flasks of 500 ml in which fresh plants and a zoospore suspension
were left for fifty days; in another experiment a drop of seawater with
zoospores was applied between the stipules of an emerged plant which
then was incubated as above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Symptoms of the presence of the parasite (on the preserved plant
material) were somewhat ellipsoid swellings involving the petioles as a
whole or in their proximal or distal parts. In the latter case the lesions
generally attained one third of the length of the petiole and were
occasionally present also on the proximal part of the leaf lamina. They
had various sizes, up to about 20 x 5 mm (Fig. 1). The swellings,
frequently obscured by the large stipules of the plant, were present in
less than 1% of the leaves.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In cross sections of the galls, the host tissue appeared hyperplastic
with cells filled with brown resting spores (cysts) (Fig. 3). The cysts
appeared globose, light brown or yellow in colour and measured 5.0-6.5
(av. 5.8) µm. Only about 2096 were single, the others were aggregated
in dyads (60%), triads (6%) or tetrads (11%) (Figs. 4-6); irregular
aggregates of higher numbers of spores were occasionally observed
(calculated from two samples with a total of 1713 observed cysts). The
multiple spores did not dissociate under the pressure of the coverslip;
they rather appeared surrounded by a common wall layer. No plasmodia
or sporangia were observed in the host cell forming the petiolar swelling.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the petiolar swellings after 14 months of dry preservation were
incubated in seawater for a week, actively swimming zoospores were
detected using Nomarski optics. They were ellipsoid or globose, 2.8-4.0
x 2.0-3.6 µm (av. 3.4 x 2.6 µm), with two simple flagella. The longer#Misc-exposition*]

evident, reached 2.5-5.0 µm (Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Attempts to reinfect plants of Halophila through zoospores had no
success. In both trials described no evidence of the parasite was found,
also after microscopic examination of decaying plant tissue. The
seawater used in these tests was that of the Bay of Naples, away from
the environment where plants of Halophila were originally collected. This
water is more strongly polluted. The zoospores appeared to be lysed
after about 24 hours, although cyst germination continued for about a
week.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ferdinandsen and Winge (1913) discovered Plasmodiophora
halophilae on Halophila ovalis when examining plants of the H. Jensen
Collection in the Botanical Museum of Hauna (New Guinea). This
material had preliminarily been examined by Dr Ostenfeld, who noticed
the presence of "pea-shaped tumors" on petioles of the seagrass; he
recognized the parasite as a Plasmodiophora and sent the original
material to Ferdinandsen and Winge. The authors observed and
illustrated, as later reported by Karling (1968), the presence in the host
cell of spherical (5 uum) cysts with a thin cell wall, together with variously
configured plasmodia of 30-60 µm diameter; sporangia and zoospore
were not seen. Karling (1968) suggested that alterations of petiolar
morphology in Halophila baillonii Aschers. from Guadaloupe observed
by Feldmann (1936) were attributable to Plasmodiophora halophilae,
although no direct observations of the parasite were reported. The
identity of P. halophilae is now uncertain because of the few features
available, as already stated by Cook (1933).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The samples from Southern Italy examined here show petiolar
swellings slightly different from those observed on plants from Java; they
were elongated rather than pea-shaped.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition, the cysts are somewhat larger than those of the original
description. However, the most relevant feature is the aggregation of the
spores in dyads, singles, tetrads and triads, in this order of frequency,
while in Plasmodiophora they are normally single. A similar appearance
of the cysts is characteristic of the genus Tetramyxa Goebel (Johnson
and Sparrow, 1961; Karling, 1968), although in this genus frequent
dissociation into single spores may occur. In the genus Tetramyxa four
species have been described (Karling, 1968), all parasites of terrestrial
or aquatic plants. The most frequent species, whose life-history has not
completely been elucidated, is T. parasitica Goebel (Goebel, 1884),
relatively rare in occurrence but widely distributed (Europe, Morocco,
Japan, New Zealand, and the U.S.A.), found as agent of galls on the
stalks, petioles and leaf margins of species of Zannichellia#Misc-exposition*]
[@169#Page-header*]

[@(Zannichelliaceae), Ruppia and Potamogeton (Potamogetonaceae)
(Dahlgren, Clifford and Yeo, 1985; Karling, 1968). T. parasitica has been
found in Italy on Ruppia cirrhosa (Petagna) Grande (R. spiralis L. ex
Oumort.)(Luther, 1949). Maire and Tison (1911) frequently observed
single spores or dyads in T. parasitica on R. rostellata; in addition,
Setchell (1924) reported in this species the occasional presence of
complexes formed by more than four cells, like those observed by us.
Maire and Tison (1911) also talk about tetrads surrounded by a common
cell wall. Cysts of T. parasitica, in TEM show the typical tetrads
completely enclosed in an outer wall, whereas each single cell has its
own wall layer (Braselton, 1990). The dimensions of the spores of T.
parasitica (3.5-7.0 µm) (Johnson and Sparrow, 1961) are in good
agreement with the present observations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The above considerations allow to attribute the observed fungal
parasite of H. stipulacea to the genus Tetramyxa. Its identity with T.
parasitica would represent a new host record for this species. However,
the low frequency of tetrads, just 11%, and the high proportion of single
spores cast some doubts, although the tetrads might have dissociated in
material stored for a long time. The formation of biflagellate zoospores
cannot discriminate between Tetramyxa and Plasmodiophora. Although
a biflagellate motile stage is typical of Plasmodiophora, Tetramyxa is the
sole genus of Plasmodiophoraceae in which zoosporangia and
zoospores have not yet been observed with certainty, as emphasized by
Karling (1968). Maire and Tison (1911) observed numerous zoospores,
oval in shape and with a unique long flagellum, in brackish water
inoculated with quiescent spores of T. parasitica; these were obtained
from swellings of plants of Ruppia rostellata Koch, but the authors were
not sure about the actual origin of the observed zoospores. Evidently it
was a mistake since a fungus with uniflagellate zoospores cannot
belong to the Plasmodiophorales. Cook (1933) observed the release of
amoeboid cells from resting spores of T. parasitica. According to Karling
(1968), the finding of biflagellate zoospores in Tetramyxa would be just a
matter of time; so the present observation would prove him right.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hosts so far reported for T. parasitica are monocots from fresh- or
brackish water, taxonomically close to the Hydrocharitaceae, to which
Halophila is assigned; however, H. stipulacea is a species growing
definitely in seawater.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The North American Truffling Society (NATS), founded in 1978, has
members across North America as as on other continents. It conducts
a continuing program on truffles and truffie-like fungi: forays, scientific
studies, education, and culinary use. Taxonomic and ecological data on the
more than 4,500 collections by members are entered into a data base
available to scientists studying these fungi. This paper introduces the#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS series on descriptions of new taxa ahd presentation of new data on
previously described taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The North American Truffling Society, Inc. (NATS) is a specialized
scientific and educational, nonprofit organization. It was founded at Corvallis,
Oregon, in 1978 by Anthony B. Walters and a small group of others interested
in study and use of truffles and truffle-like fungi (hereafter referred to as
“truffles"). Dr. James Trappe has served as scientific advisor from its inception.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS has grown from an initial few to over 300 members across the
United States and Canada and has members in several other countries as
well. Its purpose is to enhance scientific knowledge of North American truffles
and to promote appreciation and enjoyment of these interesting and often
beautiful fungi. Scientific activities include determining methods for finding
truffles; collecting specimens; recording data on locations, mycorrhizal host
associations, and seasonality; identification and classification; determining
edibility and other properties; and maintaining and expanding a library on
truffles and a computer data-base on collections. The data base is available
to members and scientists studying truffles and truffle-like fungi. Much of the
present knowledge of the edible qualities of North American truffles results
from experimentation by NATS members.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS works closely with professional mycologists such as Trappe and
Dr. Nancy S. Weber at Oregon State University and Dr. Michael Castellano of
the U. S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station, Forestry
Sciences Laboratory, Corvallis. These scientists receive all NATS collections#Misc-exposition*]
[@172#Page-header*]

[@for identification and use in experiments. Truffle collections by NATS
members have been crucial to a variety of scientific studies (e.g., Castellano et
al. 1985; Castellano and Trappe 1986; Molina et a/. 1992; Trappe and
Castellano 1986, 1991). Species ecology, use of truffle spores for mycorrhizal
inoculation of tree seedlings in nurseries, host specificity phenomena of
mycorrhizal fungi, and use of truffles as food by small mammals are all better
known as a result. Aromatic compounds produced by NATS-collected
specimens have been identified by gas chromatography and the culinary
attractiveness of several species has been evaluated (Marin 1985, Marin et al.
1987, Marin and McDaniel 1987). NATS collections provided crucial data on
fungi for use by the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team
appointed by President Clinton in 1993 to resolve issues related to timber
management in the Pacific Northwest (Holthausen, et al. 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS collections now number more than 4,500, including 65 genera
and 300 species. Collections of new or rare taxa and representative
collections of more common taxa are accessioned into the Mycological
Herbarium, Department of Botany, Oregon State University. Field data are
recorded for individual collections and entered into the data base. These data
include overstory tree species, understory plant species, air temperature, soil
moisture status, soil type and conditions, slope gradient and direction,
microhabitat or specific conditions in which the fungi are found, date, general
location, specific location, elevation, notes on fresh characters, and collector's
name. When NATS was first organized, members knew little of the where,
when or how to find truffles. As its studies progressed in Oregon, the ability to
predict the season and location for fruiting of individual species has notably
increased.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Surprises emerge as NATS members collect in unusual habitats or
under environmental conditions for which conventional wisdom indicates no
truffles will be found. Many new species have been unearthed as a result.
Habitats that have been previously well explored also yield new taxa, due
perhaps to their rarity or sporadic fruiting patterns. So far, about 100 probable
new taxa have been discovered. These will be featured in a series of papers,
the first of which follow this introduction under the title NATS truffles and truffle-
like fungi. The series will also provide updated descriptions and ecological
data on previously described taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Education is another major activity of NATS. Monthly meetings feature
speakers on a variety of mycological or botanical topics. Forays are organized
each month to varied habitats, from the wet Pacific coastal forests to deserts
east of the Cascade Mountains. Though most forays have been in Oregon
where the largest membership occurs, many localities in Washington State
and northern California have also been explored. Members in other areas are
encouraged to organize "mini-forays" to explore additional habitats and
introduce other people to truffles.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS participates in many mycological shows and exhibits, usually
providing a mock forest scene to show where and how truffles grow. NATS
Speakers present slide shows and talks to interested public organizations and
schools. A slide show with a script, available to interested organizations,
introduces truffles, how they are gathered and how they look.#Misc-exposition*]
[@173#Page-header*]

[@The NATS library focuses on truffles and related information. Library
materials are circulated to members on request. Members receive a bimonthly
newsletter featuring current news about the society and its members, reports
of collections, and other mycological items of interest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Cookbook of North American Truffles (Evans and Evans 1987)
published by NATS is still available. This volume includes general information
on hunting truffles and their culinary use. All recipes were developed by
NATS members. The more desirable North American species include all
Tuber spp., but especially T. gibbosum Harkn. (the Oregon white truffle, so-
called for its culinary resemblance to T. magnatum, the Italian white truffle),
Picoa carthusiana Tul. & Tul, Melanogaster spp., and Geopora cooperi Harkn.
These have distinctive flavors and pungent aromas and are used as
flavorings. Many others with less distinctive aromas, such as Rhizopogon,
Hysterangium and Hymenogaster spp., are used to add interesting texture to
food.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Instructions on how “to truffle," record data on the field data cards, and
submit collections for identification are provided to all new members. Those
who submit collections may enclose self-addressed post cards to be informed
of the identity of their specimens. All finds are published in the newsletter.
Many truffle "look-alike" objects are submitted by experienced as well as new
trufflers for microscopic scrutiny. Insect egg sacs, moldy fecal pellets,
weathered chewing gum, rotten chunks of wood, and parasitized mushroom
buttons have found their way to the laboratory for identification. Almost all
NATS members, including the professional mycologists, have been fooled at
one time or another.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NATS presently has members in 28 states, 3 provinces of Canada,
Mexico, and several countries outside North America. Newsletters are
exchanged with 36 mycological societies. Members come from all walks of
life, ranging from tree farmers, mill workers, teachers and dentists to
professional mycologists. All share a common interest in these fascinating
fungi and a desire to expand knowledge about them. Further information
about NATS and membership is available by telephone (503) 752-2243 or

[@Sclerogaster is not a member of the Cortinariaceae and has filled locules and
globose, hyaline spores. The ornamentation, color and shape of Kjeldsenia
spores show affinity to the Cortinariaceae. Within the Cortinariaceae,
Kjeldsenia shows alignment with Hymenogaster sensu Bougher and
Castellano (1993), and Destuntzia Fogel and Trappe (1985). Kjeldsenia differs
from Hymenogaster by possession of thin-walled, ellipsoid spores lacking a
cup-like hilar appendage. Kjeldsenia spores lack the thick, complex spore wall
found in Cortinomyces. Kjeldsenia locules are empty and lined with a
hymenium in contrast to the jell-filled locules and disorganized hymenium of

mountains of California.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thiers (1989) realigned Gastroboletus along phylogenetic lines and
coined the genera Gi illus and G. to
Gastroboletus species that had morphological affinties with Suillus and
Leccinum, respectively. Thiers (1989) also divided Gastroboletus into two
sections, Gastrosubtomentosi aligned with Boletus section Subtomentosi and
Gastroboletelloides with affinites to Boletellus. Cazarés and Trappe (1991)
recombined Truncocolumella rubra Zeller as Gastroboletus ruber (Zeller)
Cazares & Trappe (1989) based on sporocarp macromorphology and the
presence of ballistospores. Gastroboletus dinoffii resembles G. ruber in having
a sporocarp macromorphology intermediate between Truncocolumella and
Gastroboletus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: Gastroboletus dinoffii and G. ruber are intermediate between
Gastroboletus and Truncocolumella. The stipe-columella of both is more
reduced than in other Gastroboletus species and rarely, if ever, percurrent. The
spores of G. dinoffii are similar in size and shape to G. ruber and ballistosporic,
and the context of the columella of both quickly turns blue upon exposure. The
locules of G. dinoffii are tubulose and radially arranged but more or less
completely enclosed by peridium, while in G. ruburthe peridium is found as a
remenant at the apex of the sporocarp. The amyloid trama sets G. dinoffii apart
from all other Gastroboletus species except G. amyloideus (Thiers 1989).
Gastroboletus amyloideus has amyloid spores and a distinct stipe (Thiers 1975)
both of which are lacking in G. dinoffii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gastroboletus dinoffii belongs in section Gastrosubtomentosi based on
the red overtones to the sporocarp, dry peridial surface and structure of the
peridium (Thiers 1989). Boletus calopus Fries also has amyloid tramal hyphae,
blue bruising reaction of the contaxt and spore size and shape. Boletus
calopus resides in section Boletus, subsection Calopodes characterized by
yellow tubes when young, a bitter taste to the flesh and a funely reticulate stipe
(Smith & Thiers 1971).#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods of collection and macroscopic and microscopic study were
generally those of Castellano et al. (1989). Herbarium names are abbreviated
according to Holmgren et al. (1990). Colors of fresh specimens are in general
terms. Hand-cut sections of both fresh and dried material were mounted in 5%
KOH or Melzer's reagent for light microscopy. Dried spores were mounted on
pegs with double-sided tape and coated with gold for electron microscopy using
an Amray 3000 scanning electron microscope. Spore dimensions are based on
the measurement of 30 randomly selected spores; spore lengths include
sterigmal attachment. Measurements of sterile tissues (e.g., peridium) and
spores are from mature sporocarps. Light photomicrographs are from material
mounted in 5% KOH.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: Amogaster macroscopically resembles Rhizopogon, which is
derived from Suillus judging from the similarity of its spores and other
microscopic characters as well as molecular data (Bruns et al. 1989).
Amogaster differs from Rhizopogon and thus Suillus most critically in its spore
characters, having larger, asymmetrical spores that are sometimes dextrinoid
and in the color of its gleba which lacks any hint of olive or brown. Based on
these characters and the association of Amogaster with Populus spp. a
phylogenetic relationship with the genus Gyroporus or Paragyrodon should be
explored through molecular techniques. Gyroporus and Paragyrodon have
clamp connections, Amogaster lacks clamp connections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A mycorrhizal association of Amogaster and Populus is inferred due to
the close association of sporocarps with mycorrhizal roots in the field. Further

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@A taxonomic description of 4 taxa of Microascus isolated from
soil in Negev (Israel) is provided. Among them, one may be
considered as a new taxon: Microascus dimonatus Sage sp.nov., and
two seemed to be varieties of known species: M. desmosporus var.
macroperithecia Sage var. nov., M. trigonosporus var.
macroperithecia Sage var. nov.. The last strain isolated appeared to
be only a variant of M. desmosporus var. macroperithecia. The main
cultural characteristics and physiological properties of these species
are described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the course of determination of the fungal population in
soil samples from Negev (Israel), atypical Microascus species were
isolated. These species were not described in reviews concerning
the genus Microascus (Barron et al. 1961; Morton & Smith 1963;
Skou 1973; Von Arx 1975, 1978; Horie & Udagawa 1983; Malloch &
Hubart 1987;). They were not reported in previous papers dealing
with mycoflora of this area (Rayss 1950; Rayss & Borut 1958; Borut
1960; Abdel-Hafez 1982a,b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our purpose was to describe these new taxa and to give their
main physiological properties. Organic extracts from the culture
medium of some of these strains showed an inhibitory activity
against pathogenic microorganisms.#Misc-exposition*]
[@190#Page-header*]
[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Strain isolation. Soil sample (sand) was collected in Negev
(Israel), in the area of Dimona. Isolation of the strains was
accomplished by using the soil plates method of Warcup (Parkinson
& Waid 1960): the soil sample was dispatched into Petri dishes (90
mm diameter) and sterile malt extract (1.5%)-agar (1.5%) (MEA)-
chloramphenicol (0.05%) or potato dextrose agar (PDA)-
chloramphenicol media were poured over. After solidification,
dishes were incubated at 22°C and strains were isolated as soon as
they appeared. The four seemingly new species were designed by
Microascus 1, 2, 3, 4.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Soluble salts level determination. 1 g of dry soil was
suspended in 5 ml of distilled water by vigourous shaking. After
centrifugation (S min. at 3000 g) and/or filtration, pH of the
supernatant was measured and ionogram (Na*, K*, Cl-, Ca?*, Mg?*)
was established with an automated analyzer BM/Hitachi 717
(Boehringer Mannheim, France) using the methods adapted by
Boehringer Mannheim. Results were expressed as mol/g of dry
soil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Influence of temperature and pH. The strains were grown on
MEA and PDA at the usual pH of these media (5.5 for MEA and 6.2
for PDA) and at pH 7 and 8. Incubation run at 4, 22, 30, 37°C for 36
days. Growth was followed by measuring the diameter of colonies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Enzyme assays. The methods used for the detection of lipase,
protease and amylase production have been described by Hankin &
Anagnostakis (1975). Cellulases were detected according to Smith
(1977); the same method was adapted to the detection of
amylolytic activity according to Rinderknecht et al. (1967). Results
of these assays were only qualitative. Extracellular phenoloxidases
(POx) production was researched on PDA (Microascus 1, 2, 3) or on
MEA (Microascus 4) at 22?C as previously described (Guiraud et al
1992). Ten reagents were used and following their intensity, the
colored reactions observed were noted from 0 to 4. Results were
given as a POx index corresponding to the sum of the different
reactions obtained. These assays were performed with 10 to 15
day-old cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Antimicrobial activity. The strains were grown in different
liquid media. For antibacterial and anti-human pathogens assays.
the fungus (mycelium + spores) was inoculated in 250 ml
Erlenmeyer flasks, containing 70 ml of liquid PDA (Microascus 1, 2,
3) or MEA (Microascus 4) medium and grown under shaking or
static conditions at 22°C for 8 days. For anti-phytopathogens and
anti-entomopathogens assays, cultures run in yeast extract (2%)-
saccharose (4%) pH 6.5 medium, under static conditions for 5 days#Misc-exposition*]
[@191#Page-header*]

[@(previous experiments showed that these conditions allowed
optimal activity)(Pujol et al. 1990). Media were separated from the
mycelia by filtration and extracted by 2x35 ml ethyl acetate.
Organic phases were pooled and dried at 40°C under reduced
pressure. Crude extracts were dissolved in 3 ml ethyl acetate.
Target pathogenic strains were 5 bacteria (Escherichia coli,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus penicillin resistant,
S. aureus penicillin sensitive, Streptococcus faecalis), 7 yeasts
(Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C.
tropicalis amphotericin resistant, Cryptococcus neoformans 1, C.
neoformans 2), 8 Dermatophytes (Epidermophyton  floccosum,
Microsporum canis, M. gypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes 1,
T. mentagrophytes 2, T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale, T.
rubrum, T. tonsurans), 5 phytopathogens (Colletotrichum musae,
Drechslera spicifera, Fusarium oxysporum, Geotrichum candidum,
Pyricularia oryzae), 4 entomopathogens (Beauveria bassiana, B.
brongniartii, Metarrhizium | anisopliae,  Verticillium  lecanii).
Assessment of antimicrobial activity of crude extracts was
performed using the disk diffusion method previously described
(Okeke et al. 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Polysaccharide | production. Presence of extracellular
polysaccharide in culture medium was researched in shaked liquid
PDA (Microascus 1, 2, 3) or MEA (Microascus 4) medium at 22?C
according to Aouadi et al. (1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@All assays were repeated four times.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Seven taxa of Microascus were isolated from the same soil
sample. Four of them were atypical and are the object of a
description in this paper. Table 1 summarizes the main
characteristics concerning Microascus desmosporus (Lechmer) Curzi,
Microascus pyramidus Barron & Gilman, Microascus trigonosporus
Emmons & Dodge, Microascus trigonosporus var. macrosporus Orr,
which were found to be the most closely related species (Barron et
al. 1961; Morton & Smith 1963). The three new varieties and the
new species have been included in the culture collection of the
laboratory: Collection Mycologie Pharmacie Grenoble (CMPG) and

[@None of the 4 species was found to be cellulolytic while they
all had both proteolytic and amylolytic activities. In addition,
Microascus 1 showed also lipolytic activity. All strains exhibited a
POx activity and the POx index obtained for Microascus 1, 2, 3 and 4
were respectively of 8, 14, 10, 17. These values corresponded to the
sum of intensities of coloured reactions obtained when dropping on
mycelia ten different reagents able to turn into coloured
compounds if Pox are present. For each reagent, intensity of the
response was noted from 0 to 4, so the maximal value for Pox index
was 40 (Guiraud et al. 1992). No important intrageneric variations
were observed in this case conversely to observations previously
reported for other genera (Guiraud et al., 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

bacteria except S. faecalis. Extracts from culture medium of
Microascus 1, 2, 3 were inactive against phytopathogen and
entomopathogen fungi, while Microascus 4 showed an activity
against B. bassiana, B. brongniartii, C. musae, F. oxysporum. Table 2

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development and morphology of the teleomorph, including ascostroma
and perithecia, of Balansia epichloe (Weese) Diehl on the adaxial surface of
leaves of Eragrostis capillaris (L.) Nees is described and illustrated. A
review of the nomenclature of the fungus is made. The binomial B. epichloe is
considered to be untenable and a new name, Balansia kunzei Morgan-Jones &
Phelps, is proposed to replace it. Transitional stages from the primary Ephelis
anamorph stroma to the teleomorph are traced. A revised taxonomic description
is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@As discussed by Diehl (1950) and Phelps et al. (1993) the fungus now
known as Balansia epichloe has had quite a complicated nomenclatural history,
with a number of names applied to it. The first binomial given it was Sphaeria
epichloe Kunze. This name was published in printed labels, also bearing a brief
description, attached to unnumbered specimens issued as part of C.E. von
Weigelt’s fungi exsiccati, named and distributed by Gustav Kunze. The material
had been collected by Weigelt in Surinam. The exact date of issue is unknown
and the number of sets and the extent of their distribution is not certain
(Stevenson, 1971). The diagnosis provided of the fungus reads as follows:
"Sphaeria (periph. pulvin.) epichloe Kz. S. (epiphylla hypogena) oblonga
gemella, atra; perithecis ovalibus, ostiolo papillato, denum pertuso. In foliis
gramineae, Gujan, Surinam, leg. et exsicc. Weigelt 1827. Determ. Kunze."
According to Article 31 of the ICBN, distribution of printed matter accompanying
exsiccati onor after 1 January 1953 does not constitute effective publication#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station Journal Series Number 18-944853#Misc-exposition*]
[@204#Page-header*]

[@unless such is also distributed independently of the specimens. This does not
apply before that date, however, publication being effected under Article 29 of
the Code by distribution of printed matter "to the general public or at least to
botanical institutions with libraries accessible to botanists generally.". The
binomial Sphaeria epichloe Kunze was thus effectively and validly published. In
this connection Stevenson (loc. cit.) makes the following pertinent comment
with reference to S. epichloe; "Diagnosis on label, hence the name was not a
nomen nudum as has been suggested."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saccardo (1892) described what he believed to be the same fungus, giving
it the name Botryosphaeria (?) epichloe (Kunze) Sacc. This treatment was
based upon that part of the Weigelt material housed in the Jardin Botanique de
l’Etat, Brussels (BR) but it is apparent that the specimen contained disparate
elements and the fungus described by Saccardo was not S. epichloe. No asci
were observed, but rather spores which were thought to be possibly conidia of a
species of Dothiorella Sacc. The name was evidently mistakenly misapplied.
Other specimens of the Weigelt exsiccati, including one housed in The National
Fungus Collections (BPI), do bear the fungus currently known as Balansia
epichloe (Diehl, 1939; 1950).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Much confusion exists surrounding use of the specific epithets
‘atramentaria’ and ‘atramentosa’ within the Balansieae. The binomial Dothidea
atramentaria Berk. & Curt. (Berkeley, 1876), a nomen nudum and therefore not
validly published, was evidently applied to Sphaeria epichloe, without any
apparent intention of naming a new species. The epithet ‘aframentaria’ is
considered to have been an orthographic error for ‘atramentosa’ (Diehl, 1939).
The name Dothidea atramentaria was used for collections of S. epichloe issued
in a number of exsiccati, including those of H.W. Ravenel [Fungi Americani
Exsiccati No. 100] and J.B. Ellis [North American Fungi, No. 683]. F.K.A.E.J.
de Thumen used the name D. atramentaria f. eragrostidis-capillaris Thum.,
for a collection of S. epichloe, made by Ravenel on Eragrostis capillaris (L.)
Nees in South Carolina, and issued as No. 1068 in de Thumen's Mycotheca
universalis. Diehl (1939) believed the host in this set of specimens to possibly
be Eragrostis refracta (Muhl.) Scribn. and cited the material as paratype for
the binomial Dothichloe limitata Diehl, a name proposed to replace Sphaeria
epichloe Kunze. Atkinson (in Davis, 1929) proposed the new combination
Dothichloe atramentaria (Berk. & Curt.) Atk. Berkeley (1869) had previously
established the name Hypocrea atramentosa Berk. & Curt. for a fungus
collected in Cuba. This was the taxon presently known as Myriogenospora
atramentosa (Berk. & Curt.) Diehl, which Luttrell and Bacon (1977) classified
among the Balansieae. Atkinson (1905) made the new combination Dothichloe
atramentosa (Berk. & Curt.) Atk. and apparently misapplied the name to not
only B. epichloe but also Balansia hennin£siana (Móell.) Diehl. Interestingly,
Atkinson (1894) had earlier proposed the name Myriogenospora paspali Atk.
for M. atramentosa, the type species of his genus Myriogenospora Atk. It is
evident that serious misapplication of names occurred a number of times,
together with much nomenclatural confusion, during the period when these fungi
were first studied (Diehl, 1950; Phelps ef a/., 1993b). That, perhaps, is not
altogether surprising since these fungi look very similar superficially and they
all occur on leaves of grasses, with some host overlap.#Misc-exposition*]
[@205#Page-header*]

[@Diehl (1939), as mentioned above, established the name Dothichloe
limitata as an alternative binomial to replace the earlier names Sphaeria
epichloe and Dothidea atramentaria. He expressed the view that it was
questionable that the name used for the specimens issued in the Weigelt
exsiccati had validity unless published elsewhere than on the unnumbered
specimens distributed by Kunze. It was further thought that the status of
Sphaeria epichloe had been compromised through its supposed validation by
Saccardo (1892), based on incorrect identification. What Saccardo did,
however, had no real relevancy to the nomenclatural status of S. epichloe.
Because of the confusion surrounding the specific epithet ‘atramentaria’, and the
fact that it was published without a description or diagnosis, Diehl (1939)
considered it unavailable as an alternative to'epichloe'. Hence the proposal to
establish a new name. At the time, Diehl was unaware of the treatment of
Sphaeria epichloe by Weese (1919), some twenty years earlier. Weese (loc.
cit.) had described the fungus under the name Dothichloe epichloe (Kunze)
Weese, a new combination. Diehl (1950) subsequently took up this name,
making the new combination Balansia epichloe (Weese) Diehl and listing D.
limitata as a synonym. In effect Diehl treated the binomial Dothichloe epichloe
as if Weese had described a new species rather than reclassified Sphaeria
epichloe. His reasoning (Diehl, 1950), in part at least, was based upon the fact
that Weese had supplied what was referred to as "a suitable diagnosis" and
thereby a validation. The transfer made by Diehl, and the resultant binomial,
are unacceptable since the basionym was not the validly-published Sphaeria
epichloe Kunze. The latter cannot now, however, be the basis of a transfer into
Balansia Speg. since this action would create a homonym of the illegitimate
Balansia epichloe (Weese) Diehl. Anew name must therefore be established
for this fungus and the binomial Balansia kunzei Morgan-Jones & Phelps is
proposed herein.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As discussed previously elsewhere (Morgan-Jones et a/., 1993), the
position on host plants where ascostromata of members of the tribe Balansieae
are formed in large part determines their final morphology. Each taxon
develops primary Ephelis anamorph stromata, followed by secondary Balansia
teleomorph ascostromata, at specific sites; in some cases on leaves or
surrounding host culms, in others within and surrounding inflorescences (Diehl,
1950; Morgan-Jones and White, 1989; Morgan-Jones et al., loc. cit.). In each
instance, the teleomorph is elaborated by continued growth and modification of
hyphae that constitute the primary stromata. In recent years detailed accounts
of thed of several sp have been published. each with an unique
host relationship and individual morphology. These include Atkinsonella
hypoxylon (Peck) Diehl and the closely related A. texensis (Diehl) Leuchtmann
& Clay, species that form primary stromata enveloping immature
inflorescences, bearing hemispherical, pulvinate, localized ascostromata
(Leuchtmann and Clay, 1989; Morgan-Jones and White, 1989), Balansia aristidae
(Atk.) Diehl, a species whose flat ascostromata completely encircle the culms
of its hosts in the manner of Epichloe typhina (Tul.) Fr. (Morgan-Jones et al.,
loc. cit.), and Myriogenospora atramentosa (Berk. & Curt.) Diehl, a fungus
that grows entirely epiphytically on adaxial leaf surfaces forming long, narrow,
linear ascostromata (Luttrell and Bacon, 1977).#Misc-exposition*]


[@206#Page-header*]

[@Balansia epichloe (Weese) Diehl is among a very few species that form
their stromata on leaf surfaces (Diehl, 1950). It exhibits extensive hyphal
growth endophytically in both vascular and ground leaf tissue and egresses
inbetween epidermal cells and bulliform cells of longitudinal leaf grooves to
form localized, effuse stromata (Phelps et a/., 1993b). One to three stromata
may be formed ona single leaf blade, each some distance apart and always on
the adaxial surface. The somewhat similar species Balansia henningsiana, that
occurs on some of the same hosts as B. epichloe, in contrast forms its stromata
on the abaxial surface (Diehl, 1950). Following egress a felt-like, cream-
colored, prosenchymatous primary stromata is formed in B. epichloe, upon
which elliptical to long-oblong fertile areas bearing dense clusters of
conidiophores develop (Phelps et al., 1994). A study of the transition to
ascostromata and the morphology of the teleomorph is reported.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Specimens of Balansia epichloe bearing ascostromata in various stages
of development were harvested from plants of Eragrostis capillaris (L.) Nees
collected in Lee County, Alabama, and maintained in the greenhouse as described
by Phelps et al. (1993a, 1993b). Sizes of stromata, including length and
thickness, and of perithecia represent averages and range of twenty
measurements. Leaf segments with ascostromata were prepared for sectioning
as described previously (Phelps et a/., 1993a), including fixation, infiltration,
dehydration, and staining.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Concurrent with the later stages of conidium production, or immediately
after cessation of conidiation, the underlying primary stroma becomes
progressively denser and assumes a more or less pseudoparenchymatous
texture. As this is occurring, or shortly thereafter, perithecium initiation
ensues, the perithecia originating, as is typical i in other members of the
Clavicip from ial coils d ped in the stromatic tissue a short
distance below the surface, as described by Luttrell and Bacon (1977) in
Myriogenospora atramentosa. A similar condition was described by Morgan-
Jones et al. (1993) in Balansia aristidae. In B. epichloe individual perithecia
initials quickly appear superficially, as dark spots above the whitish primary
stromata, in close proximity to one another (Plate 1, C). As they expand and
mature, progressive development of the ascostroma occurs, the perithecia#Misc-exposition*]

[@eventually becoming totally embedded. The stroma in the vicinity of and
inbetween perithecia tends to remain loosely organized whereas its outer,
exposed region assumes a felted appearance superficially, becoming tightly
pseudoparenchymatous in texture and composed of more or less isodiametric
cells, except in the vicinity of perithecial necks where cells are more elongate
(Plate 2, C). Eventually cells in the outer zone become appreciably melanized
(Plate 1, F), giving the flat stroma a blackish, carbonaceous appearance (Plate
1, D). When fully developed the ascostroma has a somewhat uneven, rugulose
or longitudinally-wrinkled surface, and usually completely, or almost
completely, covers the underlying whitish primary stroma, which becomes
indistinguishable from the overlying tissue. This may be punctate, giving
indication of the position of individual perithecia (Plate 1, D). As the whole
structure becomes progressively compacted the internal texture of the
ascostromata assumes a largely uniform appearance (Figure 1). At this stage
no trace of the subtending primary stroma is discernible. Considerable
variation in stromal thickness is evident, even on a single host. Perithecia
may be slightly scattered or closely appressed (Plate 1, F). At maturity
ascostromata become twice to three times the thickness of the host leaves upon
which they are formed (Plate 1, E & F). Perithecial wall cells are elongate and
remain clearly distinguishable from the surrounding stromatic tissue at all
stages of development. A fascicle of asci is borne from a prominent mound or
cluster of ascogenous hyphae occupying the lower part of the perithecial venter
(Plate 2, B & D). The sides of the perithecia are lined by evanescent
paraphyses (Plate 2, D) and the neck by persistent periphyses (Plate 2, C).#Misc-exposition*]

[@When grown under growth chamber or greenhouse conditions in an
extremely warm, humid environment the transition from light colored, effuse,
conidiomata-bearing primary stromata into the darker, denser, perithecium-
bearing ascostromata frequently fails to occur. Profuse conidiation continues
until leaf senescence, when primary stromata dry up, fragment, and
disintegrate. This anamorph cycle may continue for up to three months with no
teleomorph development. Under such conditions, if and when the teleomorph
occurs, dark perithecial initials develop directly from the effuse primary
stroma, speckling its white surface. Only then does the ascostroma become
black and pseudoparenchymatous. Transition from the anamorph state to the
teleomorph tends to occur on numerous leaves, or even plants, simultaneously.
In nature, our observations suggest that the primary Ephelis state is relatively
short-lived, the Balansia ascostroma forming soon after leaf expansion.#Description*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development of the ascostromata of B. kunzei is essentially similar
to that of Balansia aristidae (see Morgan-Jones et a/., 1993) although the latter
are formed around culms rather than leaves. In both, a primary, Ephelis-
bearing stroma becomes converted into an ascostroma by virtue of further
growth following cessation of conidiation or partly concurrent with it. There is
quite often an overlap between the two stages. The ascostromata of B. kunzei
are generally rather better developed than in those of a species such as B.
aristidae in the sense that more sterile tissue is elaborated around the
perithecia. As a result, the latter are more substantially immersed in the
structure and the ascostroma has a more even surface. In Balansia strangulans
(Mont.) Diehl, a species that, like B. aristidae, forms stromata around culms,
perithecia are, however, immersed to an equivalent extent as in B. kunzei.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The flat, effuse stromata of B. kunzei broadly resemble those of B.
henningsiana, a species with which it has often been confused in the past (Diehl,
1950). Occurring as they do on some of the same hosts, including Andropogon
scoparius Michx., Gymnopogon ambiguus (Michx.) B.S.P., and Panicum
agrostoides Spreng., this is not surprising given their superficial similarity.
They differ, as already mentioned, in that the stromata of B. henningsiana are
invariably formed on abaxial leaf surfaces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Marssonina veratri (Ellis & Everh.) Magnus is redescribed and
illustrated from its type collection. Its synonymy with Gloeosporium veratri
(Allesch.) Höhn. is found to be erroneous. It is unsatisfactorily classified in
Marssonina Magnus and is transferred to Colletogloeum Petrak as C. veratri
(Ellis & Everh.) Morgan-Jones & Phelps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus presently known as Marssonina veratri was originally named
Marsonia veratri Ell. & Everh. and described from a collection made on leaves
of Veratrum californicum E.M. Durand in Pullman, Washington (Ellis and
Everhart, 1895). It was given the following diagnosis "Spots amphigenous,
small (2-3 mm.), whitish, with a broad, dull-purple border, which is often
elongated in the direction of the veins of the leaf for 2-3 cm., with the ends
acute, finally more or less confluent, the entire leaf becoming brown and dead.
Acervuli small, occupying the center of the spots, or irregularly scattered over
them. Conidia clavate-cylindrical, curved, upper end subtruncate, lower end
attenuated and subacute, uniseptate, hyaline, 18-22 X 3-3.5 µm.".#Misc-exposition*]

[@There has, regrettably, been some confusion over the true identity of
Marssonina veratri resulting from its erroneous listing by Petrak (1937) as a
synonym of Gloeosporium veratri [s Fusoma veratri Allesch.]. Fusoma veratri
and its obligate synonyms G. veratri and Septogloeum veratri (Allesch.)
Wollenw. are facultative synonyms of Mycocentrospora veratri (Peck) U.
Braun [= Cercosporella veratri Peck] (Ondrej, 1974; Braun, 1991; Morgan-
Jones and Phelps, 1995), a different fungus. The incorrect synonymy instigated
by Petrak (loc. cit.) was perpetuated by von Arx (1970) and by Farr et al.
(1989) so that until recently the binomial Marssonina veratri has had
subservient, misapplied status. Morgan-Jones & Phelps (loc. cit.), following
examination of its type specimen, determined its independent nature but deferred
providing an account of its characteristics. Suchis provided herein.#Misc-exposition*]
[@216#Page-header*]

[@The generic name Marssonina was established by Magnus (1906) as a
new name for Marssonia J.C. Fischer [Fungi europaei exsiccati cent. XIX. no.
1857, 1874] because of the latter being a later illegitimate homonym of
Marssonia H. Karsten [FI. Columb. 1. 97. t. 48, 1861] (a synonym of
Napeanthus Gardn.), a genus of the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae.
Magnus (loc. cit.) opined that the name [spelling] Marsonia, used by Saccardo
(1880), and subsequently perpetuated by him (Saccardo, 1884) and a number of
others, including Ellis and Everhart (1895), was a lapsus calami for
Marssonia. The genus had been named in honor of a Dr. Th. Fr. Marsson, a
pharmacist of Greifswald. A total of sixty-six species, mainly the taxa of
Marssonia [as Marsonia] included in Saccardo’s Sylloge Fungorum, were
transferred into Marssonina by Magnus. Von Arx (1957) considered
Marssonina to be a later name for Gloeosporium Desm. & Mont. but advocated
in favor of its conservation to maintain relatively long and well-established
usage.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The vast majority of species described in Gloeosporium, not viewed as
being congeneric with its type species, G. castagnei Desm. & Mont., have been
dispersed elsewhere, mostly by von Hóhnel (1916) and von Arx (1957). Sutton
(1977) suggested that sufficient difference in conidial morphology and
conidiomatal position in host tissue exists to differentiate Gloeosporium from
Marssonina. The acervuli of the former are epidermal to subepidermal,
whereas those of the latter are subcuticular. Sutton (1980), however, listed
Gloeosporium as a synonym of Marssonina with a nomen rejiciendum
propositum proviso. Gloeosporium caslagnei was among the many species
classified by Magnus (loc. cit.) in Marssonina [as M. castagnei (Desm. &
Mont.) Magnus]. Since Gloeosporium, established in 1849, predated Marssonia
J.C. Fischer by some twenty-five years and Magnus considered its type species
congeneric with Marssonina potentillae (Desm.) Magnus [= Phyllosticta
potentillae Desm.], the type species of his Marssonina, adoption of the former
generic name would have obviated the need for the coining of a generic nomen
novum. As Sutton (1977) argued there is, aes enough of a difference to
separate Gloeosporium from Marssonnina. Marssonina potentillae is now
considered a synonym of M. fragariae (Lib.) Kleb., the valid name for the type
species of Marssonina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sutton (1980) noted the probable heterogeneous nature of Marssonina and
suggested that a modern revision of it would lead to the dispersion elsewhere of
many of the more than one hundred and fifty taxa accommodated within it.
Because of a wide range of conidial morphology, conidiomatal structure, and
host-substrate relationship, it is evident that reclassification of many species of
Marssonina is desirable. In the case of M. veratri our studies have indicated
that it cannot continue to be considered congeneric with Marssonina fragariae
(Lib.) Kleb., the type species of the genus. It has the characteristics of
Colletogloeum Petrak and is, accordingly, transferred into that genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Colletogloeum, which remained monotypic for almost two
decades following its recognition, was established by Petrak (1953) for a
fungus described in the same year by Ahmad [apud Ahmad and Lodhi (1953)] as#Misc-exposition*]
[@217#Page-header*]

[@Septogloeum dahlbergiaee Ahmad [= Colletogloeum dahlbergiae (Ahmad)
Petrak]. The same fungus had previously been named Cercospora sissoo Syd.
(Sydow, 1933). Sutton (1964) made the recombination Colletogloeum sissoo
(Syd.) Sutton, the valid binomial of the type species, and redescribed the genus.
Pollack and Sutton (1972), Sutton (1975, 1980) and Singh (1977) have
subsequently added eight additional taxa, four as new species, three as
recombinations from Coryneum Nees, and one from Septogloeum. More
recently Ganapathi and Corbin (1979), Sutton and Mehrotra (1982), Sutton and
Swart (1986), and Sivanesan (1987), have added six further species to the
genus, bringing the present total to fifteen, not counting the taxon described in
this paper. Of these six species, five were novel and one transferred from
Marssonina. Anamorphs of two different pseudothecial teleomorph Ascomycete
genera are now accommodated within Colletogloeum; namely C. nubilosum
Ganapathi & Corbin, the anamorph of Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cooke) Hansf.,
and C. perseae Sivanesan, the anamorph of Coccoidella perseae Sivanesan
(Ganapathi and Corbin, loc. cit.; Sivanesan, loc. cit.). Unlike other species of
Colletogloeum both these have associated microconidial, spermogonial states.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the original description of this taxon Ellis and Everhart (1895)
evidently mistook the subtruncate base of the conidia for the apex and the
attenuated, subtruncate apex as the base. In conidial dimensions and morphology
C. veratri somewhat resembles C. artocarpi S.M. Singh, which occurs on
leaves of species of Artocarpus J.R. Forster & G. Forster [Moraceae] in India
and Nepal (Singh, 1977; Sutton, 1980). Colletogloeum rhois (Halst.) Sutton,
which is known only from its type collection made on leaves of Rhus
toxidendron L. in New Jersey, U.S.A., has similarly shaped conidia that taper
noticeably toward a subacute apex, unlike those of C. sissoo, the type species,
that are more or less cylindrical and have an obtuse apex. Colletogloeum
acaciicola Sutton & Swart and C. glochidiicola (Seshadri) Sutton are additional
species with markedly attenuated conidia. Conidia of Colletogloeum vary in
coloration from hyaline to pale brown; C. acaciae (Cooke & Massee) Sutton &
Swart, C. artocarpi, C. protii Sutton & Mehrotra, and C. rhois having the latter
characteristic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is evident that Colletogloeum, in company with a number of other leaf-
borne acervular anamorph genera such as Cryptocline Petrak, Marssonina
Magnus, Monostichella Hóhn., and Phloeospora Wallr., is, at present, somewhat
heterogeneous. With regard to generic concepts in such fungi a broad approach
based on acervulus morphology and host-substrate relationship, together with
conidiophore morphology and conidiogenesis peculiarities, can be adopted.
Alternatively, a narrower concept where monothetic differences in conidium
Shape, septation and pigmentation assume greater importance, has, in some
instances, been advocated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Criteria for genus recognition in this complex have not, historically, been
applied evenly and consistently which results in a need for critical revisionary
studies. The monotypic genus Ahmadia Sydow, for example, differs from
Colletogloeum only by possession of subcuticular rather than subepidermal
conidiomata. In conidiophore and conidium characteristics its type and only
species, A. pentatropidis Sydow, is not dissimilar to C. sissoo. A species such
as C. glochidiicola, in contrast, bears conidia that are much more pigmented,
appreciably thicker-walled, and are of a different shape. This taxon, which
was originally classified as a species of Coryneum Nees, was removed from
that genus because its conidia are euseptate rather than distoseptate (Sutton,
1975). Eventually its classification in Colletogloeum may need to be
reevaluated. The generic distinction between Colletogloeum and Phloeospora,#Misc-exposition*]
[@#Page-header*]
[@220#Page-header*]

[@based in large part on entire lack of pigmentation of conidiophores and conidia
in the latter, is by no means substantial. The addition of C. perseae extended
the limits of Col/etogloeum in that its conidia are rostrate, bearing a long apical,
cellular, branched or unbranched appendage. Differences in conidial morphology
were not considered sufficient by Sivanesan (1987) to warrant recognition of a
separate genus. Nevertheless, given the generic concepts traditionally applied to
this complex, a reassessment of this view may not be inappropriate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As things stand at present, as indicated above, Colletogloeum anamorphs
are associated with two  Loculoascomycete genera, Coccoidella and
Mycosphaerella. This is a similar situation to that existing in Marssonina
where species are associated with two genera of the Helotiales. Some have
Diplocarpon F.A. Wolf teleomorphs, while others are anamorphs of
Drepanopeziza (Kleb.) Hohn. (Wolf, 1912, 1924; Rimpau, 1962). Clearly, the
classification of these anamorphs is not, currently, as natural as it can and
should be.#Misc-exposition*]

40 x 4-8 µm, olivaceous brown, conidial scars conspicuous,

obclavate-fusiform, 30-65 x 5-8 µm, 2-4 (-6)-distoseptate,
smooth to faintly rough, olivaceous brown, apex elongated,
narrowed, pale, often almost colourless, mostly curved, base

[@The conidiogenesis could not be observed in detail, but
it is undoubtedly polyblastic. C. pulchra is the only Camp-
tomeris on a host plant not belonging to the legumes and it
differs from the other members of the genus by usually
smooth conidia with curved, colourless apices. Nevertheless,
Camptomeris seems to be the only appropriate genus for this
species (cf. Hughes, 1952; Ellis, 1971).#Description*]

[@(4) Passalora Fr. emend.#Nomenclature*]

[@Deighton (1967) re-defined Passalora Fr. and distin-
guished Cercosporidium Earle by well-developed stromata.
Within the Cercospora complex, the characteristics of stro-
mata are useful specific features, but unsuitable to discri-
minate genera. Furthermore, stromata are not absent in Pas-
salora bacilligera Fr. & Mont. (= type species of this ge-
nus). They are small but conspicuous, agreeing with the size
of the substomatal cavities of the attacked leaves (cf. Arx,
1983). Therefore, Arx (1983) treated Cercosporidium as syno-
nymous with Passalora and this has been followed by Cas-
tafieda and Braun (1989), Deighton (1990) and Braun (1992).
The conidial scars (Passalora type) are almost unthickened
to slightly thickened and slightly to obviously darkened
(Deighton, 1990; Braun, 1992). True Cercospora s.str. scars
are conspicuously thickened and darkened. The size of the
scars is variable and depends on the width of the conidial
hila. Cercospora scars are mostly broad, dark and very con-
spicuous, but fairly minute in some species with very narrow
conidia. The differences between slightly thickened Pas-
salora scars and conspicuously thickened Cercospora scars
are, of course, only gradual. But the different types of
conidial scars combined with characteristical conidia
(shape, size, colour) warrant the clear separation of Cer-
cospora and Passalora.#Description*]

[@Cercospora (s.str.) conidia (Cercospora type or Cer-
cospora-like) are long, narrow, acicular (- very narrowly
obclavate), narrowly cylindrical, filiform, obscurely mul-
tiseptate, rarely O-4-septate (in very narrow, shortly aci-
cular conidia), hyaline or subhyaline (with a faintly green-
ish tinge), rarely pale olivaceous, apex more or less acute,
sometimes obtuse, base truncate to shortly obconically trun-
cate, hila thickened and darkened.#Description*]

[@Conidia of the Passalora type are not Cercospora-like,#Description*]
[@227#Page-header*]
[@but ellipsoid-ovoid, broadly fusiform, clavate, obclavate,
subcylindrical, colourless to pigmented, usually fairly
broad (about 4-15- µm wide; occasionally narrowly obclavate,
about 3-5 µm wide, but obviously coloured), few septa (usu-
ally 0-4; occasionally multiseptate, 3-8 or even more septa,
but conidia broadly obclavate and pigmented).#Description*]

[@The characteristics of the conidia and conidial scars in
Passalora and Phaeoisariopsis are identical (cf. Deighton,
1990). The latter author confined Phaeoisariopsis to syn-
nematal species with conidial scars lying more or less flat
against the sides of the conidiogenous cells and proposed to
transfer species with more or less geniculate conidiogenous
cells to Passalora. Braun (1992) did not agree with this
treatment. The displacement of the conidial scars on the
conidiogenous cells is a good specific feature, but un-
tenable for generic delimitations. There are transitions in
Phaeoisariopsis as well as Passalora s.str. (incl. Cer-
cosporidium). Therefore, I prefer to recognize Phaeoisariop-
sis as a synnematal counterpart to Passalora (cf. Braun,
1992). The three genera can be keyed out as follows:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Savile (in Savile & Parmelee, 1964) erected a new
genus for a species like Entyloma but with germination
of Ustilago type, viz. Ustilentyloma pleuropogonis. Vanky
(1970, 1991) proposed new combinations and added two
species to this genus: U. fluitans and U. brefeldii
(Krieger) Vanky. U. pleuropogonis is known from Canada
and Greenland (Savile & Parmelee, I. c.), and U. fluitans
from Finland, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and
Romania (Liro, 1935, 1938; Scholz & Scholz, 1988;
Vanky, 1970, 1980, 1985a, b, 1987a), as well as the
present new record from Bulgaria. U. brefeldii is
distributed in Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The objective of this paper is to characterize and
illustrate morphometrical variability of ustilospores of
U. fluitans and U. pleuropogonis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Specimens from BP, DAOM, H, HUV, M, S and
SOM have been investigated in lactophenol (heated to

collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A linear graphic presentation of the statistical
parameters is used. The samples are not discrete and
the variability is continuous if there is graphic
overlapping in the M + lo areas with respect to the
character investigated. On the basis of the variation

[@The genus Ustilentyloma is new to Bulgaria and U.
fluitans is new to the Balkans.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basic statistical parameters of ustilospore
length and width are shown in Table 1 and on bar
diagrams (Figs. 5, 6).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The minimum values and means of length, as well
as minimum and maximum values, and means of width
of both species are not discrete and the variability is
continuous. There is a discreteness regarding max-value
of length only but the investigation of the frequency
distribution within the variation serie of the length of U.
pleuropogonis shows that few variants (incl. aberrants)
cause a positive asymmetry. There is not a correlation
between the max-values and the means of the length of
these species. The variability of means + 1c is not
discontinuous and in general the taxa are not discrete
with respect to length and width. The variability of both
characters is in U. pleuropogonis at an increased degree,
and in U. fluitans at a modal level or increased degree
(excl. the specimen BP 75581 - at a high degree).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Only the ranges were used in the keys to these two
species in Karatvgin & Azbukina (1989), and Vánky
(1991). The ustilospores of U. pleuropogonis are mostly
broadly elliptical or irregularly polygonal while these of
U. fluitans are mostly orbicular, suborbicular, ovate to
broadly elliptical. A character with good differentiating
value is the length/width ratio (L/w) (Fig. 7).#Misc-exposition*]

[@NEW SPECIES OF KELLERMANIA, PIPTARTHRON,
PLANISTROMA, AND PLANISTROMELLA
FROM MEMBERS OF THE AGAVACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@ANNETTE W. RAMALEY#Misc-exposition*]

[@7 Animas Place, Durango, Colorado 81301#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY: Five new fungal species from hosts in the Agavaceae are
described. Kellermania nolinifoliorum and Planistroma nolinae and its anamorph,
Piptarthron crassisporum are from Nolina sp., Piptarthron dasylirionis is found on
Dasylirion sp., and Planistromella torsifoliorum, the teleomorph of Kellermania
uniseptata (—Alpakesa uniseptata), is from Yucca rupicola.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION:  Piptarthron and Kellermania are coelomycete genera with
dark-brown to black, thick-walled, immersed, ostiolate conidiomata, holoblastic,
determinate conidiogenous cells that each form a single acrogenous, large,
hyaline, thin-walled conidium which lacks appendages in Piptarthron and bears
appendages in Kellermania. The species of Piptarthron are separated by the size,
shape, and septation of the conidia, and the number of locules in the.
conidiomata (3). The species of Kellermania are separated by the number of
septa in the conidia, and the size and number of apical appendages (2, 5). The
separation of the two genera on the basis of the presence or absence of an apical
appendage is controversial (1, 6). Characters of the teleomorphs so far
discovered support this separation as they are consistently different (3, 4, 5) in
that ascospores of Planistroma, the teleomorph of Piptarthron are aseptate, while
ascospores of Planistromella, the teleomorph for Kellermania are septate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements are from living materials. Cul-
tures from anamorphs were prepared by suspending conidia in a drop of sterile
tap water on the surface of potato dextrose agar (PDA) in a petri plate and
spreading the drop with a glass rod. After twenty four hours, single germinated
conidia were placed on PDA. Cultures from teleomorphs were made by washing
asci three times in sterile tap water and transferring individual asci to PDA in a
petri plate. Cultures were maintained at room temperature on a table top.#Misc-exposition*]

[@cleft that lies midway between two such fiber bundles. The fungus may gain
access to the interior through stomata on the lateral walls of these clefts—
hyphae extending through a stoma from an exterior mycelial mass to a
developing conidioma have been observed. Conidiomata develop between the
epidermal cells of the stomatal cleft and the fiber bundle. A ‘lip’ of cells forms
between the upper or lower epidermis and the edge of a fiber bundle (Fig. 1, D).
Conidiomata are, therefore, asymmetric in transection. If a conidioma develops
on both sides of a stomatal cleft, it is symmetric and has two rows of locules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidial appendage is formed as in other Kellermania species (2, 5).
Conidial initials are bluntly rounded, but after considerable elongation the apex
narrows. The tip may then be occluded forming the apical appendage. In K.

the conidia were essentially identical for cultures from conidia of Piptarthron
crassisporum and cultures derived from ascospores of Planistroma nolinae. It was
therefore concluded that the two species are a part of the same holomorph.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascospores of Planistroma nolinae are larger than those from P. yuccigena A. W.
Ramaley (3), the other published species whose anamorph also has aseptate
conidia. However, observation of many collections has shown that ascospores
produced by the teleomorphs of several distinct anamorphs (unpublished) are
very similar in size and shape to those of P. nolinae. Therefore, ascospore size
alone cannot be used to separate P. nolinae from other species having
anamorphs with aseptate conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Piptarthron crassisporum forms linear conidiomata in the parenchyma between
fiber bundles running the length of the leaf. The stromata may be symmetric
about the stomatal cleft midway between two fiber bundles, or mostly on one
side of such a cleft, the other side having only a ‘lip’ of stromatal cells. If the
stroma is on only one side of a cleft, it contains a single row of locules; if the
stroma is symmetric about the cleft, it contains two rows of locules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Piptarthron specimens with aseptate conidia are generally difficult to separate
into species. Collections from different plant species or localities may seem
distinct, but rotted, when compared to other collections, there is intergradation
of conidi a major disti hing ch . No average length or
width was published for the conidia of Piptarthron yuccae (Ellis and Everh.)
Sutton (1). Assuming those averages lie approximately midway between the
mimimm and maximum length and width, the average length/average width#Misc-exposition*]

[@quotient (L/W) for that species is approximately 19.4. The L/W for
Piptarthron pluriloculare A. W. Ramaley is 10.4, and for P. crassisporum, 5.2. P.
crassisporum is separated from these other species with aseptate conidia by the
relative width of the conidia as well as the blunt conidial apex. The slow
growth of germinated conidia is also characteristic of P. crassisporum, though
not ascertainable in old collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidia from culture were somewhat shorter and narrower than from the host
in nature (Fig. 4, F). However, their long, slender form is so unusual for
septate members of the genus they cannot be confused with any other taxon yet
encountered. A small collection of a teleomorph, confirmed by culture to be
part of the holomorph including Piptarthron daylirionis, has aseptate ascospores,
28-40.8 x 10.4-13.6 zm. Aseptate ascospores remains a consistent character for
teleomorphs of Piptarthron species having either septate or aseptate conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The width of the linear conidiomata of this multilocular species is determined
by the anatomy of the leaves of the host, Dasylirion. Conidiomata are located
between the subepidermal fiber bundles running the length of the leaves. Part
of the dark conidiomatal wall extends over the top of the fiber bundle on each
side of a conidioma forming a rim on the cup-shaped wall, and the locules and
bounding wall occupy the space between the fiber bundles. More fiber bundles
may be found on the abaxial than adaxial side of a leaf, consequently
condiomata on the abaxial side of a leaf may be narrower than those on the
adaxial side. The width of a conidioma is occupied by one, two, or occasionally,
three locules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species has been adequately described and illustrated (2). The collection
that included the teleomorph differed from this description only in having larger
conidiomata, up to 380 µm vs 140-280 µm diam, and larger conidia, up to 55 x
17.6 µm vs 30-43 x 10-12 µm. Much of the difference in conidial size might be
accounted for by measurement of live vs long-dead conidia.
Stromata destined to form La as well as idia have a ll idial
locule than those forming only conidia. After conidium formation, the
remainder of such an ascogenous stroma consists of bulbous cells which form
one or more archicarps toward the base, near the dark stromatal wall.
Spermatia adhere to a narrow trichogyne which extends from each archicarp
beyond the top of the stroma. The asci are basal and crowded in the locule.

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Roots of Phellinus weirii-colonized Douglas-fir stumps, fumigated with
chloropicrin 20-mo before or left as untreated controls, were
excavated and dissected at 30-cm intervals. When decay typical of
that caused by P. weirii was encountered, a 5-cm-thick disk was
removed and later sampled for resident fungi (Thies and Nelson 1987).
Hyphomycetes originally isolated from 17 fumigated stumps and from six
untreated stumps were grown in culture at room t rature on DIFCO
potato dextrose agar (PDA). oatmeal agar (OMA), malt extract agar
(MEA), and corn meal agar (CMA), and identified by the senior author.
Identifications were based on keys and descriptions of Carmichael
(1962). Crane and Schoknecht (1973), Ellis (1971, 1976), Gams and

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Between May 1989 - June 1992 I had the opportunity to carry out detailed
surveys of the fungi and other microorganisms associated with diseased
plants in the Cape York Peninsula, Torres Strait Islands, Western Papua
New Guinea and Irian Jaya. The surveys resulted in the discovery of
several new taxa (Hyde & Philemon, 1991) or new descriptions of formerly
inadequately described pathogens (Johnson & Hyde, 1992) as well as
host/pathogen lists (Hyde & Alcorn, 1993; Hyde & Philemon, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@An unusual diaporthaceous taxon having clavate ascospores provided with
basal septa and apical mucilaginous appendages was collected on senescent
banana leaves in Jayapura, Irian Jaya. As it cannot be accommodated in
any previously described genus, Clavatisporella gen. nov. is introduced to
accommodate it. A second species characteristic of Plagiostoma Fuckel was
also associated with leaf spot on avocado. Surveys of the literature indicate
that this species is undescribed and therefore Plagiostoma perseae sp. nov.
is introduced.#Misc-exposition*]

ascospores with irregular septation at the base and narrowing at the apex
where a mucilaginous pad is provided. Asci are broad cylindrical to clavate
with a refractive subapical ring, while ascomata are immersed. This taxon

adequately in any existing genus and therefore Clavatisporella is introduced.
The placement of Clavatisporella is questionable, but broad cylindrical asci
with a subapical refractive ring are characteristic of the Diaporthales (Barr,
1978; Monod, 1983). The papillate ascomata, oblong, stipitate asci, wide
paraphyses and ascospore septation indicate a relationship with Buergenerula

immersed with eccentric or lateral necks. Asci are oblong ellipsoidal, while
ascospores are hyaline with a median, supramedian or submedium septum

characteristic and can readily be included in this genus. Frohlich & Hyde
(1994) have recently described and illustrated Plagiostoma euphorbiae
(Fuckel) Fuckel and a related genus Maculatipalma Fróhl. & K.D. Hyde on

Sivanesan, Guignardia perseae Punith. , Otthiella brenesii Petr. , Peroneutypa
perseae Rieuf & Teasca, Phyllachora gratissima Rehm and Endothia
hauanensis Bruner can be dismissed since these genera are unlikely to
confused with Plagiostoma. In Mycosphaerella perseae L.E. Miles the
ascospores are very small (12-13 x 3-4 µm) (Saccardo, 1928) while in
Physalospora perseae Doidge they are aseptate (Doidge, 1922). It is
therefore unlikely that Plagiostoma perseae has previously been described
from Persea americana.#Misc-exposition*]

Lophiostoma mangrovei (originally named as L.

to introduce a new genus or to place these

investigated by SEM, is found to be phialidic, and similar
to that described for Cacumisporium  capitulatum,
Chloridium virescens and Gonytrichum spp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Circinotrichum was erected by Nees (1817) for a species,
C. maculiforme, found on decaying oak leaves. Little was known about
the conidial ontogeny in this genus until Pirozynski (1962) described, for
the Circinotrichum-Gyrothrix group, an apparently simultaneous
production of conidia in a ring just below the apex of the conidiogenous
cell and the vertical elongation of the apex, after producing the first crop
of conidia, leaving behind a thickened annular scar. Ellis (1971),
substantially agreeing, described conidiogenous cells in Circinotrichum
as polyblastic and percurrent. Pirozynski & Patil (1970) suggested
analogy between the conidiogenous cell tip of Circinotrichum or
Gyrothrix and the one of Chloridium virescens var. chlamydosporum
(van Beyma) W. Gams & Hol.-Jech. [referred to as Chloridium
chlamydosporis (van Beyma) S. Hughes], as illustrated by Mangenot
(1952) or that of Cacumisporium capitulatum (Corda) S. Hughes, as
demonstrated by Goos (1969). They suggested also analogy with
Exophiala jeanselmei var. heteromorpha [referred to as Margarinomyces
heteromorphus (Nannf.) Mangenot], that, on the contrary, is at present
considered annellidic (De Hoog, 1977; Cole & Samson, 1979; Domsch et
al., 1980). Hammill (1972) confirmed the morphology illustrated by
Mangenot (1952) making electron microscope observations of wall
differentiation during conidiogenesis in C. virescens var.
chlamydosporum; in this paper, Hammill showed, by TEM, that the outer
layer of the conidial wall is continuous to the inner layer of the
conidiogenous cell, called by him "sympodulo-phialide". Gams &#Misc-exposition*]
[@290#Page-header*]

[@Holubová-Jechová (1976) stated that in this last species conidia are blown
out sequentially from new growing points within the phialide apex, as it
also occurrs in Gonytrichum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sutton (1973), describing the conidiogenous cells of C. capitulatum,
suggested that they "are distinctly annellidic, but only with 2—5 transverse
hyaline to sub-hyaline annellations above the first distinctive brown one
figured by Goos (1969) and Mangenot (1953). More than a single
conidium sometimes appears attached to the apex of the conigenous cell,
indicating that if this indeed occurs in spite of the presence of annellides,
the conidiogenous loci may be multiple. This is similar to the situation
seen in Ceratocladium microspermum Corda (Hughes, 1951) and
Circinotrichum spp. (Pirozynski, 1962)".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cunningham (1974) described the conidiogenesis in Gyrothrix
pediculata Cunningham as phialidic sensu stricto, after studying it with
time-lapse in pure culture. In this species, single conidia are produced
successively, from conidiogenous cells with a tip “usually truncate to very
slightly flaring to form a slight collarette", without any proliferation.
Sutton (1980) agreed with him, describing conidiogenous cells of
Circinotrichum rigidum Sutton as "enteroblastic, phialidic".#Misc-exposition*]

[@But what are the annular scars described by Pirozynski (1962), and
actually visible in many species of this group? Why can we often see the
apex of conidiogenous cells attached to a group of liberated spores, if
conidiogenous cells are phialidic sensu stricto?#Misc-exposition*]

buffer (pH 7.2) and post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer
(pH 7.2), dehydrated in a graded acetone series, critical-point-dried,

[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

[@Scanning electron micrographs show that conidial formation in
C. maculiforme is phialidic, without any contribution of the outermost
wall layer of the conidiogenous cell to the conidial wall (Fig. 1 a); but
conidiogenesis seems to be "holoblastic" by an inner layer of the
conidiogenous cell wall (Fig. 1b): successive conidia are produced
laterally to the previous one, and multiple conidiogenous loci are
formed (Fig. 1 c). The conidia remain grouped around the tip of the
conidiogenous cell (Fig. 1 d). After detachment, conidia may remain
aggregated and mucilage is involved in this conidial package (Fig. 1 e).#Misc-exposition*]
[@#Page-header*]
[@Fig. 1. - Circinotrichum maculiforme (SEM): a) conidia protruding from the
conidiogenous cells; the outer wall layer of the conidiogenous cell is clearly
not continuous with the conidial wall; b) a young conidium seems to be
produced "holoblastically" by an inner layer of the conidiogenous cell wall;
c) the uneven apex of a conidiogenous cell suggests multiple conidiogenous
loci, next to a still attached conidium; these loci are internal to the outermost
wall layer of the conidiogenous cell; d) conidia attached to the tip of the
conidiogenous cell: the outer wall layer of the conidiogenous cell forms a
frill below the tip; e) groups of detached conidia, partly aggregated, to left

[@The outermost layer remains as a frill around the multiple conidiogenous
loci (Fig. 1 d).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidia produced by a single conidiogenous cell seem in different
stages of development at the same time (Fig. 2 a, b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidial production in C. maculiforme is similar to that described by
Goos (1969) for Cacumisporium capitulatum and by Hammill (1972) for
Chloridium virescens var. chlamydosporum, but also to Dictyochaeta
setosa (Hughes & Kendrick) Cabello & Arambarri (Hughes & Kendrick,
1968; Cole & Samson, 1979) and Gonytrichum (Swart, 1959), where the
outer layer of the conidiogenous cell wall is not involved in conidium
production. The inner layer(s) of the conidiogenous cell wall could
produce the conidial wall, by a mechanism intermediate between phialidic
and 'sympoduloconidiogenous', as described for Chloridium virescens
var. chlamydosporum by Gams & Holubová-Jechová (1976). This kind
of conidiogenous cells may be called as 'polyblastic' phialides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The frill observed and interpretated as a remnant of the outer wall
layer of the conidiogenous cell could look like a number of annular scars
under the optical microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Circinotrichum clusters of conidia sometimes can be observed
attached to the detached apex of the conidiogenous cell. This detached
apex is probably just the elongated thin-walled part produced inside the
conidiogenous cell.#Description*]

[@Although conidia often appear as uniform coherent clusters, conidial
production is probably asynchronous, as developing and fully developed
conidia can be observed on the same conidiogenous cell (Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Wynnea Berk. & M.A. Curtis is one of the most
peculiar within the Pezizales with large ascomata (up to 100 mm diam.)
and auriculate, spathulate, otideoid or sparassoid form, arising from a
hypogeus stipe or rhizomorph. Microscopically it can be distinguished by
its non-amyloid asci, navicular ascospores in frontal view and
subreniform in lateral view and ornament walls (Seaver, 1928; Rifai,
1968; Korf, 1972; Pfister 1979). According to Pfister (op. cit.) Wynnea
includes 4 species: W. americana Thaxt., W. gigantea Berk. & M.A.
Curtis, W. macrotis (Berk.) Berk. and W. sparassoides Pfister. Recently
Lui et al. (1989) described two species from China: W. macrosopora Liu
et Cao and W. sinensis Liu et Cao. Preparations for microscopic studies
were made in 5% KOH, Melzer’s reagent and cotton blue in lactophenol.
Colors were based on Kornerup and Wanscher (1978).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion. W. macrotis was previously only known from India and from
Tibet (Pfister, 1979). However Cooke (1875-1879) and Saccardo (1889)
reported this species from Mexico without a precise locality. Thaxter
(1905) stated that these reports were not confirmed. The material studied
conforms with Pfister (1979) and Waraitch (1976). The latter author
described W. macrotis as W. intermedia Waraitch which is a synonym
(Pfister 1979). W. macrotis is distinguished by the appendage of the
terminal cells of the ectal excipulum and by the ascospore wall with a
fine ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]

necessitated a thorough revision of all available type material and other interesting

[@Collecting Areas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collections treated in this report are from 1) Yellowstone National Park,
2) Teton National Park, 3) Rockefeller Highway, 4) Teton National Forest in the
vicinity of Jackson Hole and east of Teton National Park up to Togwotee Pass, 5)
Shoshone National Forest in the vicinity of Falls Camp ground and the Brooks Lake
area and 6) in the vicinity of the Union Pass in the Wind River Mountains.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The geology of this area is highly diversified, and since many Cortinarii prefer
calcareous soils certain localities proved particularely productive (Moser, McKnight
& Sig] 1995). The richest areas were between Turpin Meadow Lodge and Fourmile
Meadow, along Flagstaff Road and Creek in Teton National Forest, the Brooks Lake
area and Falls Campground in the Shoshone National Forest, and the area around
Union Pass in the Wind River Mountains.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type of vegetation also has a great influence on species richness ( Moser,
McKnight & Sig] 1995). Particularely productive are spruce forests ( Picea engelmannii
Parry, P. pungens Engelmann, often mixed with Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.,
Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco. Pinus contorta Dougl. is also often mixed with
Picea or Abies. Pure pine forests are generally dryer and the pattern of diversity in
the accompanying Cortinarius species is much less.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@When harvested, each collection of Cortinarius basidiomata was wrapped
separately in aluminum foil or occasionally in waxed paper. Aluminum foil is
preferred as this maintains true natural colors and other essential fresh characteristics
better and longer. The collections were transported in cool boxes when ever possible
and kept in the laboratory refrigerator until color photographs were taken. Detailed
written field notes were prepared the same or the following day. For the more
interesting taxa Vera McKnight made pencil sketches and watercolor paintings as
soon as possible. A y ination was done to check
basidiospores and critical structures which do not revive well in KOH or ammonia.
In most cases the fluorescence under UV-light (354 nm) was also noted on fresh
basidiomata. A detailed microscopic study was carried out in Innsbruck with an
Olympus BHS2 microscope, a Sony SSC-C350P color video camera and a Sony
Kx14CP1 monitor. Basidiospore measurements for statistical purpose were made from#Misc-exposition*]

fluorescence. The context, when exposed to the air for some time gives a yellow

can be seen within the hyphae of the veil and the epicutis which fluoresces red like

[@Comments: The orange veil, the purple KOH reaction, the type of
pigmentation are a striking combination of characters. The only closely related
species seems to be C. amnicola A.H.Smith. As judged from the description and type
study it has similar characters and belongs in the same group.’ We suspected that
C.rubens Kauffm. would also fit into this group but the type of pigmentation seems
different and the spores are much larger. In Europe C.aurantiobasalis Bidaud has been
recently described with an orange veil around the bulb, while the veil on the pileus
is described as white but becoming yellow ( Bidaud et al. 1993). It, however, has blue
colors on stipe, and partly on the pileus and currently would be assigned to the
Coerulescentes. The chemical characters of these taxa should be investigated more
carefully.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: Cortinarius fraudulosus has been observed several times in
the area. There are, however, macroscopically rather similar taxa but with different
spore sizes. The species is common in European spruce forests on calcareous soils.
Melot (1986) thinks that this might be the same as C. argutus Fr. In fact, the two
species are closely related but differ in habitat, spore size and thickness of the
lamellae. Cortinarius argutus grows with hardwood trees. The odor of greencorn is
much more pronounced in C. fraudwlosus. Melot (1986) has described a vine-red
discoloration of the context, which may appear even after prolonged time of 12-24
hours. From our observations this discoloration varies in intensity and in many
collections is totally lacking. In our American collections we did not observe this
character. C. paracephalixus Bohus (1976) shows the same type of vine-red
discoloration on the context, has the same odor but not the distant lamellae and
grows under deciduous trees. The spores are of the same size and type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: Cortinarius subfoetens is well characterized by the coloration
and size of the basidiomata and similarity from above with Russula foetens and related
species. The small spores, distinctive odor and type of KOH reaction of the pileus
cuticle suggest a relationship with the Glaucopus group. However, it differs from this
group by the lack of any bluish colors both on the lamellae and stipe and the absence
of an innately fibrillose pileus cuticle. There are in Europe taxa of the Glaucopus
group without blue colors e.g. C. glaucopus var. acyaneus Mos. The odor of greencorn
occurs in other American collections in the Glaucopus group (unpublished)#Misc-exposition*]

European C. elotus Fr. The latter has smaller spores 10-12 x 6-7 µm, the pileus has
olive-brownish to brownish innate fibrils or maculations on a straw-yellow ground
color, the lamellae are rather variable in color (whitish, gray, sometimes with lilac
tinge, to wax yellowish or argillaceous), the stipe is whitish to violaceous and the

[@There are a large number of records of Cortinarius fulvoochrascens from
different parts of Europe. Observations on numerous collections from Wyoming and
Washington indicated that this taxon might be conspecific with Cortinarius
pseudoarquatus A.H.Smith. A study of the holotype as well as additional collections
preserved in the herbaria in Ann Arbor and Seattle confirmed this supposition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cortinarius fulvoochrascens is widely reported in Europe from mountainous
conifer forests, mainly under spruce. It shows some degree of variability and Henry
(1889) has described a series of varieties and closely related species. The variability
concerns macroscopic characters and spore size. However, the shape of the spores is
rather constant. From our observations the correlation between variability of spore
size and macroscopic characters is rather inconstant and therefor it is difficult to
distinguish species or varieties in this complex on that bases. We made the same
observation in North America. Table 1 gives an idea of the variability of spore size
both in Europe and America.#Misc-exposition*]
[@313#Page-header*]

[@The taxon is very common in the Rocky and Cascade Mountains. We have
seen it in Wyoming, Washington and California. A.H.Smith had many records from
Oregon (under the name C. pseudoarquatus). Typical forms agree well with European
collections, however, the range of variability seems to be even greater in North
America than in Europe. We have studied numerous collections of A.H.Smith,
D.E.Stuntz and our own collections and thus far have been able to recognize two
varieties, var. fulvoochrascens and var. subcaninicolor and one form, f. marginatus
under var. fulvoochrascens. Further study may determine that there are additional
varieties or forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: This taxon is very similar to C. elegantior var. elegantior in
habit, spore characters and in the reaction with NH,OH. Variety americanus differs
in yellow veil color, in paler more yellow pileus color lacking olivaceous tinges, and
the colors of the context which are yellowish but never deep rhubarb color in the
lower part of the stipe. This rhubar color is distinctive and characteristic of var.
elegantior from Europe. Also the initially white and later ochraceous to brownish
spots caused by veil remnants typical for var. elegantior have never been observed in
var. americanus. The spores in most American collections are smaller than in
European material. The differences, however, are not great enough to warrant a
specific separation. In several collections the spore content and/or the gill trama
stains red in 3% KOH. However, this seems to be rather a quantitative character as
some collections show a strong reaction, others only weakly, and in some it is not at
all recognizable. We can not correlate this with any other character and we have
made the same observation in European material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The interpretation of C.elegantior in Europe remains somewhat unsettled.
Henry (1935, 1943) originally thought that the species he called C.elegantissimus Hry.
(validated 1989) might be the species of Fries (1838). Recently he seems to have#Misc-exposition*]
[@321#Page-header*]

[@returned to his first opinion. This interpretation, however, does not agree with the
protologue. Fries( 1838) indicates the habitat for his species as "silvis montanis", and
later in the Monographia (1863) "in silvis montanis abiegnis". C.elegantissimus Hry.
to the contrary, is strictly a hardwood species. Moser admits that our interpretation
also has some weak points, particularly with regard to the color of the lamellae
which Fries calls "vitellinis olivascentibus".#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is no collection of A.H.Smith under the name Cortinarius elegantior in
the herbarium at Ann Arbor. A collection of C. H. Kauffman from Leal, Colorado,
18 Aug. 1919, which has limoniform spores 13.5-15.5 x 8-10 µm may represent var.
americanus. Also at Ann Arbor is a collection of K.H. McKnight, F8233,(- 65090817)
MICH and BRY, from Pebble Creek, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming 9
Aug.1965, which has spores 13-14 x 8-9 µm and shows the characteristic dark spore
print. This is very likely this taxon. There may be collections of A.H.Smith of this
taxon among his nummerous unnamed collections. In the manuscript which he left

[@Comments. Cortinarius umbilicatus is a rather common fungus both in
Europe and in North America. In the University of Michigan Herbarium are two
collections by Kauffman from Colorado (Leal) under the unpublished name
"Cortinarius nigrelloides". Moser collected it also in a spruce plantation in Michigan,
91/482 and 91/482a (IB), Stinchfield Wood, Washtenaw Co, Michigan, 29 Oct 1991.
In part 3 of this series Moser (1993) described an alpine form associated with Salix
arctica (IB 91/348). Brandrud et al. (1992 ) call Cortinarius umbilicatus (= C. adalberti)
Cortinarius depressus Fr. We object to this interpretation. Fries (1863) placed his
fungus in the subgenus Hydrocybe and describes and figures it without the white veil,
which is always strongly developed in C. umbilicatus P.Karst. The currently used
name C. adalberti Favre ex Mos. is, however, superseeded by the older name of
Karsten. A revision of the holotype of Cortinarius umbilicatus Karst. revealed that
this species is conspecific with C. adalberti. Melot (in lit.) thinks that also C. nitens
P. Karst. might be the same species. However, apparently no type material exists
species, therefor the best choice is certainly C. umbilicatus P. Karst, (holotype leg.
P.Karsten, Mustiala Salois, 29.8.1892). We give some data of the revision of the type
collection: The dried specimens show a relatively short stipe and a relatively pale
color of the lamellae. The basidiospores are 5.7-7.2 x 3.5-4.2 µm, mean 6.3 (S = 0.33)
x 3.8 µm (S = 0.18), Q = 1.52-1.83, mean 1.65 (S = 0.07), V = 35.4-61.8, mean 47.5

[@Comments: The American collections of Cortinarius fuscoperonatus agree
fully with European material. In Europe the species is also mostly frequently found
under Abies but also occurs under spruce. From C. pseudobovinus it can be
distinguished easily by the larger size, by the browner colors and the different spore
shape and size. Collection 16348 of A.H. Smith from Mount Baker, Washington,
could at first glance suggest this species, but has distinctly smaller spores (9-10.2 x 6-
6.5 m ).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taxonomical disposition of the genus Amauroascus in the family Amau-
roascaceae v. Arx has been discussed by von Arx (1971, 1977b, 1987), Currah
(1985, 1988), Cano and Guarro (1989), and Guarro et al. (1992). Furthermore.
Guarro et al. (1991) reevaluated the genus Nanizziopsis Currah as a related
genus which is characterized by white ascomata, asperulate peridial hyphae
constricted at septa, hyaline and globose ascospores. and a Chrysosporium
Corda anamorph. Recently, Guarro et al. (1992) established the genus Amaura-
scopsis Guarro et al. with globose ascospores surrounded by a loose pitted
epispore (sheath) as a genus similar to Amauroascus. The present isolate,
however, differs from Nanizziopsis and Amauroascopsis mainly by the absence of
sheathed ascospores. In addition, no Chrysosporium anamorph is observed. The
ascospores of the related genus Arachnotheca v. Arx have a membranous or
mucilaginous sheath, it is distinguished from the new fungus by having an
anamorph with arthroconidia separated by disjunctives. According to Currah
(1985) and von Arx (1987), ascomata covered with undifferentiated interwoven
hyphae and spherical ascospores without membranous sheath are typical charac-
teristics of the members of the genus Amauroascus. We therefore propose a new
species in Amauroascus to accommodate this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Amauroascus are distinguished on the basis of ascospore size,
color, morphology, and on characteristics of the peridial hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus Amauroascus purpureus closely resembles A. niger in their
globose, reticulate ascospores, but the ornamentation pattern of those of the
latter are more regular (Fig. 7) and they are bigger (4.5-6 µm). The typical
ornamentation and the purple ascomata differentiate this species from the rest
of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cano and Guarro (1989) assigned eight species into Amauroascus and
provided a key to this genus. We follow their species concept and provide a
partly revised key to species in the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat and distribution: Porina exacta is known from single locations in Tasmania
and the South Island of New Zealand. In Tasmania, it occurs on shaded trunks with
smooth, moist bark in cool temp rainfe of the callidend type ( 1
ture after Jarman et al. 1994), where it associates with bryophytes, Thelotrema lepa-
dinum, and incipient thalli of the foliose lichens Psoroma microphyllizans and
Pseudocyphellaria multifida. This habitat is rather unique for Tasmanian corticolous
Porina species in that with the exception of P. sylvatica, with which P. exacta also
occurs, the other taxa are found mainly on twigs. In New Zealand, the new species
occurs on siliceous rocks in shady lowland forest dominated by Nothofagus and
Dicksonia.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Notes:The thallus and perithecia of Porina exacta most closely resemble those of
P. elegantula (McCarthy & Kantvilas 1993), a species with smaller perithecia and
ascospores which are shorter, 11-21-septate, and distinctly acicular to fusiform, 2-3
µm wide with acute apices. Morever, P. elegantula appears to be a species of dry
coastal vegetation. Also similar is P. sylvatica which has generally larger perithecia
and markedly broader, typically fusifc Remarkably, all the p
of P. exacta examined consistently had fifteen septa.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Porina exacta appears to be a very rare species, because extensive searches of both
known localities failed to reveal any further populations. Whilst many of the saxi-
colous species of the genus are also apparently uncommon, being represented by very
few or only one specimen (McCarthy 1993), this is unusual at least amongst the cool
temperate corticolous species where ecological and floristic studies (Kantvilas &
Jarman, unpubl.) have indicated that the other species can be locally quite abundant,
albeit in a very restricted microhabitat. It is possible that P. exacta is more abundant in
some hitherto unsampled habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two new saxicolous species of Byssoloma from New Zealand
are described and illustrated, and a key is provided for the five
species known from that country.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Byssolomais a genus of crustose lichens which colonize mostly leaves but sometimes
bark or rock (Galloway 1985). The name in Greek — "cottony hem" and refers to
the cobwebby (byssoid) ins of the h are posed of loose
hyphae which grow out of the excipulum | of the stants and lie on the surface of
the thallus. The byssoid margins are not always obvious - in some species they are
reduced or tumed under, and therefore must be sectioned to be seen clearly (Kalb &
Vézda 1990). Also, in some species they are dense rather than cobwebby, and hence
are easily mistaken as lecanorine. However, unlike true lecanorine margins, they lack
algal cells and a cortex, and are built of free rather than compressed hyphae. Often the
hyphae are encrusted with crystals (Vézda & Kalb 1991) which are colourless and
nearly invisible when viewed in bright field, but are strongly coloured and highly
visible when viewed in polarized light.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although byssoid margins are their most striking trait, all species of Byssoloma are
also crustose and ecorticate, with a hymenium reacting I4 blue, simple or only spar-
ingly branched paraphyses, thick-walled and eight-spored asci, and colourless and
transseptate spores 9-30 x 2.5-6.5 µm. Their pycnidia are mostly sessile and globose,
and their conidia simple and mostly pear-shaped. Their algal symbionts are species
of the family Chlorococcaceae with globose cells 5-12 µm in diameter. Until recently,
all known species of Byssoloma were thought to be nearly obligately foliicolous
(Santesson 1952).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduced in Trevisan (1853), the name Byssoloma was displaced for seventy
years by the illegitimate Pilocarpon and Tricholechia (Santesson 1952). On the basis
of its ascus characters, it is now placed in the Pilocarpaceae (Zahlbruckner 1905
emend. Hafellner 1984) as a segregate of I s. lat. (Lec les). The#Misc-exposition*]


[@358#Page-header*]

[@closely related genus Fellhanera Vézda (1986) differs in having an excipulum of
continuous paraplectenchyma rather than byssoid hyphae, and also by Mycobilimbia-
like ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Galloway (1985) lists two Byssoloma species, both of them foliicolous: B. sub-
discordans (Nyl.) P. James (as B. rotuliforme (Mull. Arg.) R. Sant. ex Thorold) and
B. subundulatum (Stirton) Vézda (as Bacidia subundulata (Stirton) R. Sant). A third
foliicolous species, B. leucoblepharum (Nyl.) Vainio, was reported recently by
Galloway (1992). In this paper we describe two new saxicolous taxa and provide a
key for all five species.#Misc-exposition*]

has increased rapidly. Most of the records are, however, scattered.
Lichenicolous fungi are mainly mentioned as a complement of regional
catalogues of lichens (e.g. BOQUERAS & GOMEZ-BOLEA, 1986;
ALVAREZ & CARBALLAL, 1987; ETAYO, 1988, 1994; CALATAYUD &#Misc-exposition*]

HAFELLNER, 1979; HAWKSWORTH, 1981; NAVARRO-ROSINES &
HLADUN, 1990) or as descriptions of new species or genera (e.g.
NAVARRO-ROSINES & HAFELLNER, 1993; HAFELLNER & NAVARRO-
ROSINES, 1993). Recently, a few more comprehensive lists of
lichenicolous fungi have been published (NAVARRO-ROSINES &
HLADUN, 1987; HAFELLNER & SANCHO, 1990 and GIRALT & GOMEZ-
BOLEA, 1988). These kinds of contributions are very valuable for the
planned Spanish lichen flora, where lichenicolous fungi should also be
considered. Many new and interesting finds are expected, in view of the
great ecological and climatic diversity of this territory (including also the
Canary Islands). This paper is our first contribution of a series dealing with
lichenicolous fungi. The samples have been collected on saxicolous,
terricolous and epiphytic lichens, in different parts of the Iberian Peninsula
and Canary Islands, the eastern Spanish territories being the best
represented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopic features were examined with a Zeiss Stemi SR dissecting
microscope. Microscopic characters were studied in squash preparations
or in 10-20 uim sections mounted in water, 10% KOH (K), Lugol's iodine
solution, erythrosin or lactophenol cotton-blue, using a Olympus BH-2 light
microscope and a Nikon Optiphot-2, fitted with Nomarski differential
interference contrast. Nomenclature mostly follows HAWKSWORTH
(1979, 1981, 1983), CLAUZADE et al. (1989) and ALSTRUP &
HAWKSWORTH (1990) for lichenicolous fungi, and PURVIS et al. (1992)
and NIMIS (1993) for host species. The material examined is deposited in
VAB-lich. herbarium and in P. Diederich private herbarium (herb.

[@THE SPECIES#Misc-exposition*]
[@Abrothallus acetabuli Diederich#Page-header*]

[@This recently described species (DIEDERICH, 1990: 298) is distinguished
from other Abrothallus species occurring on Parmelia sens. lat. by the
hymenium not reacting in K, the epithecium K+ yellow, the rather large
apothecia (to 0.5 mm in the material examined) and by the dimensions of
the ascospores (14-16 x 5-7 µm) and conidia (7-8 x 4-5 µm). Abrothallus
acetabuli is so far restricted to Parmelia acetabulum and does not produce
malformations on its thallus. A previous citation of Abrothallus
parmeliarum on Parmelia acetabulum from Catalonia (GOMEZ-BOLEA,
1985), probably refers to this species. Abrothallus acetabuli is known from
France, Germany, Luxembourg, perhaps the Netherlands (DIEDERICH,
Op. Cit.), and Spain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abrothallus parmeliarum (Sommerf.) Arnold#Misc-exposition*]

[@This widely distributed lichenicolous fungus has been collected on
Parmelia saxatilis, P. tinctina and P. lusitana, inducing deformations in the
thalli of these lichens. It could be mistaken for Abrothallus bertianus, but
typical specimens of that species never form cecidia or deformations in
the host lichen (SANTESSON, 1960: 514), have smaller ascospores
(HAWKSWORTH & MINTER, 1980: 587; ALSTRUP & HAWKSWORTH,
1990: 15), and the vegetative hyphae are I+ blue. A. parmeliarum has
been reported on many Parmelia species and also on Platismatia glauca
(SANTESSON, 1993: 7) but, in our opinion, it might be an heterogeneous
taxon. The specimens we examined on species of Parmelia subgenus
Xanthoparmelia differ from those on P. saxatilis, the host species on which
this lichenicolous fungus was described, by the intense K+ green reaction
in all parts of the hymenium, including the lower part. At the moment, we
consider these specimens within the variability of A. parmeliarum, but a
further taxonomical study with additional material would be required to
decide whether such specimens could be separated in a different taxon.
The identity of Abrothallus caerulescens Kotte, a neglected species
described on a Parmelia subgenus Xanthoparmelia, should be also
investigated in order to have a more conclusive opinion on this subject
(Diederich, in litt.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Arthonia diploiciae is easily distinguished from other Arthonia species by
the very small ascomata, arising in groups of up to 125, inducing brown
spots in the thallus of the host, by the 4-spored asci, the size of the
ascospores, and by its occurrence on Diploicia canescens. It is close to
Arthonia epiphyscia, from which it differs in the much smaller ascomata,
and especially the 4-spored asci. This is also a relevant character for its
separation from other lichenicolous Arthonia reported on lichens of genera
in the Physciaceae, such as A. epimela (SANTESON, 1993: 16) or the
recently described A. aggregata (ALSTRUP, 1993: 96-97). A. diploiciae
must be considered as pathogenic, since those parts of the lichen thallus
infected are partially destroyed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@that A. epiphyscia is restricted to species of the genera Physcia and
Phaeophyscia. DIEDERICH (in litt.) agrees with Santesson's opinion and
suggests that specimens of A. epiphyscia reported as growing on
Caloplaca or Xanthoria ssp. might belong to A. molendoi. We have
examined samples of the A. epiphyscia complex on Caloplaca aurantica,
Physcia stellaris and Xanthoria parietina, and certainly, those occurring on
Physcia stellaris have a darker hypothecium than those on Xanthoria and
Caloplaca. Consistently, following the above mentioned criterion, the first
ones clearly belong to A. epiphyscia sens. strict., and the second ones are
treated under A. molendoi. In a wide sense, A. epiphyscia is a
cosmopolitan species, probably common in the Iberian Peninsula, where
it is locally abundant in nutrient-rich habitats.#Misc-exposition*]

[@"Melaspilea" canariensis D. Hawksw.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As Hawksworth mentioned in PURVIS ef al. (1992: 367), "the genus
Melaspilea is heterogeneous and badly in need of a modern revision. The
generally accepted type species, Melaspilea arthonioides (Fée) Nyl.
appears to be close to Buellia". "Melaspilea" canariensis is a commensal
on Pertusaria, previously reported as "Karschia" talcophila var. irregularis
(HAFELLNER, 1979: 212; NIMIS & POELT, 1987: 108; CLAUZADE et al.,
1989: 49). One of us (V.C.) examined the holotype of Melaspilea
canariensis and found that the hymenium has no reaction with Lugol's
iodine (HAWKSWORTH, 1982b: 84), but turns blue when using this
reagent after K. This lichenicolous fungus was previously known from the
Canary Islands, where it seems to be frequent (VOUAUX, in PITARD &
HARDMAN, 1912: 69; KALB & HAFELLNER, 1992: 72), and it is reported
here for the first time from the Iberian Peninsula. The samples were
collected on Pertusaria gallica, growing on volcanic rocks in the Gata
Cape coast (Almeria, southeastern Spain). It is noteworthy that the typical
Mediterranean - Macaronesic distribution of this fungus is similar to that of
some species of lichens such as Ramalina requienii, Dimelaena radiata or
Caloplaca gloriae (LLIMONA & WERNER, 1975: 16, 26; CALATAYUD &

[@Abstract: The new combination Bunodophoron melanocarpum (Sw.)
Wedin is made, and the nomenclatural and taxonomic problems regarding
this name are discussed briefly.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bunodophoron A. Massal. was recently resurrected (Wedin 1993)
following a hypothesis on the phylogeny of the family Sphaerophoraceae
(Caliciales s. lat.) based on a cladistic parsimony analysis. Bunodophoron
includes the majority of the species formerly classified in the genus
Sphaerophorus Pers. In that paper, I briefly mentioned the largely unsolved
taxonomic and nomenclatural problems in the "Sphaerophorus melano-
carpus"-complex. The type species of Bunodophoron, B. australe (Laur.)
A. Massal., distributed in temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, was
considered distinct from the other material traditionally lumped into
"Sphaerophorus melanocarpus". The remaining taxonomic problems
regarding this species-complex were left for future studies, and no other
name were suggested for these other collections, which most probably
represents several species. To provide such a name which can be used for
this species complex until the remaining taxonomic problems have been
solved, the combination Bunodophoron melanocarpum is suggested here.
The name is the oldest in the complex and will under any circumstances
come in use for one part of it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A CHEMICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE LICHEN
GENUS PERTUSARIA: ADDITIONAL DATA AND CORRECTIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@ALAN W. ARCHER#Misc-exposition*]

[@National Herbarium of New South Wales,
Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, NSW, Australia, 2000#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT: Chemical data are listed for additional taxa in the lichen
genus Pertusaria. 57 taxa are placed in subgenus Pertusaria and 13 taxa are placed
subgenus Monomurata, section Monomuratae. Hypoprotocetraric acid,
divaricatic acid, and sekikaic acid are reported as new / compounds in the genus
Pertusaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION -#Misc-exposition*]

[@It was recently proposed that the lichen genus Pertusaria be divided into three subgenera
and two sections on the basis of chemistry, morphology and spore number, and a list of
taxa in each subgenus, to; gether with their chemistry was given (Archer 1993). This note
describes the chemistry of additional Pertusaria taxa and allocates them to the proposed
subgenera on the basis of their chemistry and morphology. The new reports are based on
the literature (Dibben & Poelt 1987, Gilbert & Coppins 1992, Ovstedal & Smith 1992,
Awasthi & Srivastava 1993, Archer & Elix 1993, Lumbsch et al. 1993, Archer & Elix
1994, Archer & Elix 1994a, Elix et al. 1994, Elix et al. 1995) and the examination of
type specimens, from G, H, PREM, TUR-V, S and W, except in the case of Pertusaria
patagonica Miill.Arg. where specimens from the type locality were examined, and
additional recent collections in Australia. In addition, several lichen compounds are
reported as new to the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The compounds were identified by thin-layer chromatography (Elix & Ernst-Russell
1993) and liquid chromatography (Feige et al. 1993). Only the major lichen compounds
found are reported although these are often accompanied by traces of biosynthetically
related compounds.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHEMISTRY#Description*]
[@2'-O-Methyldivaricatic acid and 2,2'-di-O-methyldivaricatic acid occur (Elix et al.,
1994) with 2'-O-methylstenosporic acid as major compounds in the holotype of
Pertusaria tuberculifera Ny. t. velloziae Vainio [TUR-V 6771] described from Brazil
(Vainio 1890; 108). 2-O-Methylhyperlatolic and 2-O-methylsuperatolic acids occur (Elix
et al., 1994) as major compounds in the holotype of Pertusaria modesta Müll.Arg.
[Venezuela, Caracas, Ernst, 1878 (G)] (Müller 1884) and in Pertusaria follmanniana
Archer & Flix from Australia. Divaricatic acid has been shown to be a major lichen acid
ina i of an d 8-spored lous species collected near Sydney,
Australia [Archer P 7705] and sekikaic acid occurs, together with lichexanthone and stictic
acid, in a specimen of an un-named variety of Pertusaria dehiscens Müll.Arg. from
eastern Australia [Archer P 377]. Hypoprotocetraric acid was found in Pertusaria
vallicola Flix & Malcolm from New Zealand (Elix et al. 1995).#Description*]

[@Ochrolechia geminipara (Th.Fr.) Vainio has recently been transferred to the genus
Pertusaria (Brodo 1984, Hanko et. al 1985, Purvis et al. 1992) as Pertusaria geminipara#Misc-exposition*]


[@386#Page-header*]

[@(Th.Fr.) Knight (Brodo 1984, Purvis et al. 1992) or Pertusaria geminipara (Th.Fr.)
Brodo (Hanko et al. 1985). The unusual chemistry of this taxon, namely the occurrence
of the B-orcinol benzyl esters alectorialic and barbatolic acids, and the small spores
suggest that this taxon does not belong in the subgenus Pertusaria as recently defined
(Archer 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two syntypes of Pertusaria grisea Vainio var. trachythallina Ris. (Risdnen
1932) [Chile, H. Roivainen, Feb.1929 (H)] contain hypothamnolic and protocetraric
acids. In spite of the presence of hypothamnolic acid, the specimens gave no colour with
alkali (possibly b of the low of hy lic acid) but reacted P+
orange, due to the protocetraric acid. Lamb noted (in sched. ) that the specimens were
quite unlike Pertusaria grisea Vainio and it is suggested here that these sterile specimens
possibly belong to the genus Siphula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CORRECTIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pertusaria casta Zahlbr. was previously placed in subgenus Pertusaria (Archer 1993:10)
on the basis of Zahlbruckner's report of double-walled spores (Zahlbruckner 1936: 172).
However examination of the type specimen [South Africa, C.P., Knysna, van der Bijl
861 (PREM)] showed that the spores have a thin, single wall, 3-5 µm thick so the
species is more properly placed in subgenus Monomurata.#Misc-exposition*]

Tortosa (province of Tarragona), on the smooth-barked trunk of /lex aquifolium L.,
growing besides a calcareous wall and protected by fallen blocks. It was found with

[@Observations: This new species shares many essential characters with the
type species of the genus, Strigula smaragdula Fr., according to the concept of the
genus as described by HARRIS (1973, 1975): the apical structure of its ascus
(thickened at the tip of the exoascus and with a small ocular chamber), its
paraphyses thread-like, unbranched or ionally forked, and the presence of both
macro- and microconidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The majority of species of Strigula described until now grow on leaves, bark,
plant debris and moss. S. affinis (Massal.) R.C. Harris and S. taylorii (Carroll ex

(BRICAUD et ROUX, 1991) and S. endolithea Roux et Bricaud ad int. (ROUX et
BRICAUD, 1993) are also saxicolous. S. calcarea differes from S. porinoides by the
thin and pale excipulum, without involucrellum; the triseptate ascospores, (15-) 17-
22 (-23) x (4-) 5-7 (-8) µm and macroconidia with 3 or 5-7 longitudinal septa. S.
endolithea differes in the macroconidia (16-) 20-28 (-34) x (3.5-) 4-4.5 (-5) µm with
5-7 septa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@S. porinoides is the first European species with submuriform ascospores and
macroconidia. NIMIS et al. (1994) found that the variability of ascospores and
macroconidia is more than we have observed: 24-34 x 6-8 (9) µm with 7-10 (12)
transverse and 1-4 longitudinal septa, and idia measuring 19-26 (35) x 4.5-
6.5 (8.5) µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussions: Boletellus singerii is dintinguished by its
special colour and glutinous pileus and stipe, as well as for
its white and glutinous veil. It is related with B. elatus,
and B. longicollis (Ces.) Pegler & Young that
belong to the Section Ixocephalli Singer, but differs in the
non-annulate basidiomata in the former, the cinnamon brown,
rugose-areolate pileus, the longest, thin and longitudinally
striate stipe and the spores longer (15.2 - 25 x 8 - 13.5 µm)
than B. singerii in the second species and the ovoid to
ellipsoid and smallest (9.5 - 15 x 8 - 12.5 µm; Corner, 1972)
in the last species. B. singerii was described in English in
Singer et al., (1992) as "B. singerii González-Velázquez",
without any discussions. This species is named in honor to
Dr. Rolf Singer for his valuable works on the agarics from
Mexico.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present checklist of Bulgarian Uredinales 373 rust species
on 1053 vascular plants are recorded, making 1389 rust-host com-
binations. The synonyms of rusts publishing in the literature con-
cerning Bulgarian Uredinales, with references to the names used
in the checklist, as well as a host-rust index are listed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper attempts to compile all published data of Bulgarian rust fungi.
Atanasoff & Petroff (1930) and Trifonova (1947) have published lists of
diseases on plants in Bulgaria, including 173 and 105 rust species respec-
tively in the taxonomical scheme emploing here. The concepts and defini-
tions of rust species influence the number of rusts recognizing in a particu-
lar geographic region; thus as many as 640 species were reported in Bul-
garia, but I herein recognize 373 species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nomenclature and delimitation of rust species employed in this paper
follow mostly these used by Gjaerum (1974), Gjaerum & Sunding (1986)
and Majewski (1977, 1979). The author’s names of rust fungi are abbrevi-
ated according to Hawksworth (1980). The nomenclature of the hosts and
the floristic regions of Bulgaria (Fig. 1) are in accordance with Kozhuharov
(1992).#Misc-exposition*]
[@406#Page-header*]

[@Because many rust species have been published under different names, syn-
onyms are listed separately with reference to the correct names used in the
main list.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the "Primer Congreso Nacional de Micología", celebrated in July 1992 in
Tenerife (Canary Islands), we intended to collect Agaricales s. lato. Unfortunately this
was not possible because of the lack of rainfall in the previous months. However, in the
"Casino Taoro" gardens, at Puerto de La Cruz, there were some mushrooms growing as
a result of irrigation. These fungi were identified as Chlorophyllum molybdites, and
after having showed them to the personnel of the "Casino Taoro", they told us they
have been observing these mushrooms every year during the last years, wondering
about whether they were edible or not.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two main reasons led us to study and describe this species: (1) it is a rare and
unreported species to the Canary Islands, and (2) a large amount of carpophores (more
than 40) were collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our material agrees well with REID & EICKER 's (1991) description of this
species, except there are two noteworthy differences: (1) the stipe is wider at the base
bulbous-like), and (2) the spores are somewhat longer than those described by these
authors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pileus 7-20 cm in diameter, globose to broadly-convex, umbonate, applanate
when mature, margin incurved. Epicutis brown-ochraceous, broken into large plaques
or scales from the margin to the middle of the pileus, and exposing iis whitish subcutis.
Stipe 5-25 x 1-2 cm, cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, bulbous (up to 4 cm in
diameter), whitish to cream-coloured, with a whitish mobile annulus located at the
apex. Gills free, crowded, wide, with lamellulae; colour changing according to the
stage of development and the dryness of tissues: when young cream-coloured,
acquiring greenish shades at maturity and showing gray-olivaceous colours in
exsiccata. Trama reddish-white when cut or bruised. Smell and taste none. Epicutis a
trichoderm consisting of cylindrical hyphae, compressed and sometimes branched (e.g.
35 x 7 µm). Spores 9.5-12 x 6-8 µm, amyloid, broadly ellipsoid, with thick yellowish-
hyaline walls, metachromatic in cresyl blue, apex truncate and often showing an apical
and central germ pore. Basidia tetrasporic (e.g. 23 x 9 µm). Cheilocystidia 25-35 x 10-
15 µm, forming a sterile band at the edges, hyaline to ochraceous, globose to pyriform
with a narrow base. Neither pleurocystidia nor clamp connections have been observed#Description*]

[@OBSERVATIONS: Chlorophyllum molybdites is a new record for the
mycoflora of the Canary Archipelago. It is a poisonous species whose effects may vary
considerably from one person to another. Because of its similarity with Macrolepiota
rhacodes (Vitt.) Singer, we examined local material of the latter (Herbarium TFC Mic
2.016, 3.956 and 6.450), coming from "Laurisilva forest", and its identification has
been confirmed. Therefore, we have eliminated the possibility that previous records of
Macrolepiota rhacodes (collected in the Canary Islands) could have been
misinterpreted and confused with C. molybdites.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chlorophyllum Massee non Murrill, of Singer's tribus Leucocoprineae, shows
great macro- and microscopical similarities with Macrolepiota Singer especially with
M. rhacodes (Vitt.) Singer. According to SINGER (1986), Macrolepiota differs from
Chlorophyllum because the latter presents the following characters: greenish spore
print, rare clamp connections, spores indistinctly metachromatic when stained with
cresyl blue, poisonous properties and a mainly tropical and subtropical distribution
However, we think these features does not define and characterize Chlorophyllum as a
distinct genus. The green colour (pileus, stipe and gills) has also been observed in
Macrolepiota olivascens Moser ex Moser & Singer, and the absence or presence of
clamp connections is variable according to different authors. Moreover, several
poisoning cases due to species of Macrolepiota (M. rhacodes and M. venenata) have
been reported in the mycological literature. Finally, SINGER (1986) indicates that
Chlorophyllum has spores which are often not so clearly metachromatic as those from
Macrolepiota, and that the distinction of both genera by the capacity of the spore wall
to absorb Congo red, as pointed out by WERESUB (1971), is even sharper.
Nevertheless similar chemical differential reactions can be found in taxa belonging to
Amanita, Mycena or Gymnopilus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand the micro- and macroscopic morphological similarity between
Macrolepiota and Chlorophyllum supports their synonymy. All these reasons have led
us to combine C. molybdites to Macrolepiota and to create the new section
Chlorophyllum sect. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An extensive work on Chlorophyllum molybdites, realized recently by REID &
EICKER (1991), including a very rigurous chorological revision, gives us some extra
information about its poisonous properties. Besides, these authors have a broad concept
of this species including also C. molybdites var. congolensis (Beeli) Heinemann as a
synonym, despite the fact that the latter has smaller spores and a brighter sporeprint
(HEINEMANN, 1967). This species can be found on rich soils (gardens, plantations,
lawns, etc.) and is widely distributed throughout the world, being more abundant in the
tropics, with New Zealand representing its southern and North England its
septentrional limit (SINGER, 1986; REID & EICKER, 1991; GUZMAN& GUZMAN-
DAVALOS, 1992). It is also worth to mention its abundance in North America
(PHILLIPS, 1991). This species has been reported in Europe by SINGER (1946),
VELLINGA (1990) and WATLING (1991), always in relationships with exotic
introduced plants. Our collection from the Canary Islands shows it is an allochthonous
taxon, which has been introduced with the "American lawn-grass" Stenotaphrum
americanum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the last decades literature concerning with floristic studies of
conidial fungi from tropical environments have increased (Rambelli et al. ,

[@474#Page-header*]

[@Matsushima, 1993). However, the mycota of most of the tropical regions
is still largely unknown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The saprobic microfungi of mexican forests, are as yet, poorly
known. Because of its geographic location, Mexico is a transition area
between the nearctic and the neotropical regions. Among the mexican
vegetation types included in the neotropical region are the cloud forests,
which have a mixture of tropical and temperate tree species (Puig, et al.
1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Due to their special climatic features and their high leaf litter
accumulation on the forest floor, cloud forests are exceptional ecosystems
for the study of leaf litter fungi. Recently initial survey have been
conducted to characterize the hyphomycete flora associated with leaf litter
and to assess species dominance and succession during the process of leaf
decomposition (Heredia, 1993, 1994) in cloud forest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@STUDY AREA#Misc-exposition*]
[@The study area is located in a forest adjacent to Xalapa, within the
Rancho Guadalupe at the 2.5 km on the old road Xalapa-Coatepec (19°
21‘N, 96° 57'W), and at an altitude of 1225m. The annual mean
temperature is 18.4°C, with a total annual rain-fall of 1957 mm, and
mean annual relative humidity above 80%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The canopy and subcanopy are composed of the following dominant
trees; Liquidambar macrophylla Oersted, Carpinus caroliniana Walter,
Quercus germana Cham. & Sch. and Q. xalapensis Humb.. Litterfall
biomass is estimated at 9.2 ton/ha/year, with leaves being the main
component of the litter. The species with the greatest contributions to the
forest litter are L. macrophylla, C. caroliniana, Q. germana and Q.
xalapensis (Correa, 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@BIOGEOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]
[@Most of the species listed above have been reported from other plant
host and many have widespread geographic distributions, therefore
indicating they are generalist with regard to host specificity. However,
these fungi may exhibit a degree of specialization for the stage of the
decomposition at which their conidiophores develop.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several species among these fungi could be considered "terrestrial
aquatic hyphomycetes" (Ando, 1992) because they have modified conidial
appendages or arms like Ingoldian hyphomycetes. The frequency of
hyphomycetes with these specialized conidial forms may be an adaptation
to local dispersion in the cloud forest environment with its constant
elevated relative humidity and persistent films of water on surfaces of the
vegetation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Of the species presented above, most of them have geographic
distributions with tropical affinities; 13 species are generally restricted to
the tropics, 10 are from both tropical and temperate biomes, but none are
species restricted to temperate climates. Considering that the mesophilic
forest of Veracruz consist of both tropical and temperate tree genera, then
a similar mixture of temperate and tropical decomposer hyphomycetes,
as we have observed, would be expected. Continued explorations of the
communities of microfungi on other plant-related substrata in the
mesophilic cloud forest is needed to understand biogeographic patterns of
fungi in this unique, but receding habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Five new species of hyphomycetes belonging to genera Acremoniula, Bactrodesmium,
C ium, Endoph. and A lictys are described and illustrated. All the
species were found on plant debris collected in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The
specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Ecología (XAL).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The state of Veracruz has very diverse vegetation. Most studies
on its biodiversity have dealt with the flora, fauna and macroscopic fungi,
however hyphomycetes of the region remain poorly explored. In order to
evaluate the hyphomycete diversity in the tropical areas of Veracruz the
authors have made collecting trips. The following five dematiaceous
hyphomycetes were collected from plant debris, mainly leaf litter from
cloud forest and tropical rain forest. Based on their distinctive
morphological characteristics, they are proposed as new species. All the
specimens are deposited in the Herbarium of the Instituto de Ecología
(XAL).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion. Species of Bacrrodesmium are typically saprophytic,

palmicola has certain features in common with B. microleucurum (Ellis,#Misc-exposition*]
[@495#Page-header*]

[@1965) known from Chile on Chusquea cummingii. These features are: the
conidial shape, the presence of black bands, and conidia with a large
blackish terminal cell. However, they differ in the number of septa and
in the appearance of the conidial wall. In this new species, all the conidia
walls are notablely verrucose. Another species very similar to B.
palmicola is Bactrodesmuim globosum Hol.-Jech. found on rotten wood
of Fagus sylvatica from Czechoslovakia (Holubová-Jechová, 1972). The
main differences between them are the distinctly verruculose wall in the
conidia of B. palmicola, the apical cell shape, which is sphaerical in B.
globosum, in contrast with the obovoid or clavate shape of B. palmicola,
and the absence of black bands at the conidial septa of B. globosum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion. The conidial morphology of this species is similar to
Monodictys castaneae (Wallr.) Hughes. However, the long and thick
spines on the mature conidia of M. spinosa and their size and color
separate it from M. castaneae. Two other species that have similar
morphological characteristics are M. fluctuata (Tandon & Belgrami) M.
B. Ellis (Ellis, 1976) and M. namatacensis Matsushima. In the latter
species, the conidia also have prominent spines but they are sarciniform
(Matsushima, 1971). These features, the cellular configuration of the
conidia and their size easily distinguish M. namatacensis from the new
species. We agree with Rao and Hoog (1986) in comprehensive revisions
of the genera Monodictys and the related genera Berkleasmium Zobel and
Pithomyces Berk. are surely needed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@A restudy of the morphology and anatomy of the foliicolous lichen Pseudogyalecta verrucosa revealed that this
species is not related to the Gyalectaceae (Gyalectales), but congeneric with Badimia in the Lecanorales, coming
closest to Badimia pallidula. The nomenclatural consequences are briefly discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Pseudogyalecta was introduced by VEZDA (1975) to accomodate a single new
species, P. verrucosa, characterized by its foliicolous growth habit, verrucose thallus, gya-
lectoid apothecia with I+ blue hymenium and simple, apically thickened paraphyses, asci
with distinct tholus and submuriform ascospores, and Chlorococcaceae as phycobiont. The
new genus was considered to be related both to Gyalecta Ach. (Gyalectaceae) and Gyali-
dea Lett., the latter at that time included in the Asterothyriaceae, but now referred to a new
family Solorinellaceae (VEZDA & POELT 1990). As Pseudogyalecta could not be included
neither in the Gyalectaceae nor in the Asterothyriaceae without a considerable extension of
their respective diagnoses, VEZDA (1975) discussed the erection of a new family.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, subsequent studies of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa by the first author indicated
that this species might actually belong to the order Lecanorales, and here to the family Ec-
tolechiaceae, rather than being related to the Gyalectales. This was partly confirmed by a
closer investigation of the type material by the second author, who suggested a relationship
to certain species of Badimia VEZDA (1986), a genus formerly referred to the Ectolechia-
ceae, but now included in the Pilocarpaceae (LUCKING et al. 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@We therefore conducted a detailed restudy of the morphology and anatomy of Pseudo-
gyalecta verrucosa, in order to establish its correct systematical position.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@All known collections of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa originate from tropical Africa. The following specimens

[@The morphology and anatomy of the specimens were studied according to LOCKING et al. (1995), who rein-
vestigated a large number of species of Fellhanera and Badimia in order to clucidate their systematical relation-
ships. The following characters were taken into consideration: thallus morphology (micro- and macrostructure,
colour) apothecial morphology and external development (size, shape and colour of primordial stages and ma-
ture apothecia), apothecial anatomy (exciple; epithecium; hpothecium; hamathecium; ascus structure; size, sha-
pe and septation of ascospores), anamorph (external appearance and anatomy; size, shape, and septation of co-
nidia), and phycobiont.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thallus morphology. - The thallus of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa is provided with large,
hemispherical verrucae which are 0.15-0.2 mm in diameter and filled with colourless crys-
tals, probably calcium oxalate (Fig. 1A-C). Between the verrucae the thallus is smooth to
very minutely farinose. The thallus colour varies from whitish or pale greyish to light bluish
or greenish grey, the verrucae being purely white or at least paler than the remainder of the
thallus#Description*]

[@Apothecial morphology and external development. - The apothecia are regularly roun-
ded, but may become somewhat irregular in outline when old. The apothecial disc i is usually
plane (Fig. 1A-C). Apothecial geny is gy pous, and early pri | stages are
visible as hemispherical papillae (Fig 1A) The apothecial margin is not very distinct and
disappears in old apothecia (Fig. 1B-C). The diameter of mature apothecia varies between
0.3 and 1.0 mm. The apothecial disc is pale flesh-coloured to orange and somewhat trans-
lucent, with the margin being concolorous with the disc or slightly paler.#Description*]

[@Apothecial anatomy. - The lateral part of the exciple is paraplectenchymatous, its cells
having relatively thick, gelatinous walls, whereas the internal part is composed of radiate,
branched hyphae embedded in a gelatinous mass (Fig. 2A). There is no encrustation with
crystals in any part of the exciple. However, the outermost margin of the exciple sometimes
disintegrates into short threads with globose cells (cf. LOCKING et al. 1995). An epithecium
is not distinct. The hypothecium is colourless to pale yellowish.#Description*]

[@The paraphyses are usually simple, septate, 1 5-2 µm thick and slightly thickened api-
cally (Fig. 2B). The ascus is of the lecanoralean type, with a well developed tholus. When
stained in Lugol's solution, the ascus tip exhibits a more or less tubular structure becoming
broader towards the apex. The upper- and outermost part of the tholus is darker than the
central and basal parts (Fig. 2B). This structure matches the Badimia-type (LOCKING et al
1995), which is most similar to the Byssoloma-type sensu HAFELLNER (1984)#Description*]

[@The ascospores are 20-32 x 5.5-7 µm in size, ellipsoid to fusiform and colourless. Most
ascospores are 7-septate, but part of the ascospores becomes submuriform when mature,
with 1(-2) longitudinal septa. Very rarely ascospores with only (4-)5(-6) or with (8-)9(-10)
transverse septa were found (Fig. 2C)#Description*]

[@505#Page-header*]

[@Campylidia. - A careful reinvestigation of the available collections other material from dif-
ferent localities revealed two specimens of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa carrying campylidia
(T. Pócs et al., no. 6403, Mabberley, no. 1381). The campylidia are of the Badimia-type
and very similar to those described for B. polillensis by SERUSIAUX (1986). Mature ones
are about 0.7-1.5 mm broad and 0.3-0.6 mm deep. Their upper part is pale flesh coloured
to orange, similar to the colour of the apothecia#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidia are filiform, multiseptate, 100-120 x 2-2.5 µm in size, and provided with
several, 8-10 µm long and 0.5 µm thick lateral appendages (Fig. 2D).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phycobiont. - The phycobiont is a species of Chlorococcaceae, probably belonging to the
genus Zrebouxia. Its cells are rounded and 7-10 µm in diameter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@As obvious from the description, Pseudogyalecta verrucosa belongs to Lecanorales s.str.
and is not related to the Gyalectales. Most of the characters mentioned above where cor-
rectly circumscribed in the original diagnosis (VEZDA 1975). However, the apothecial deve-
lopment, the detailed ascus structure, and the campylidia were unknown at that time. The
gyalectoid apothecia and the simple, clavate paraphyses make it easily understandable why
the species was related to the Gyalectales instead of the Lecanorales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A comparison of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa with representants of the genus Badimia
(LOCKING et al. 1995) demonstrates that Pseudogyalecta verrucosa is closely related to Ba-
dimia pallidula (KRMPH.) VEZDA and in fact only separated by the larger ascospores with
more numerous septa, and by the somewhat different excipular structure. The close rela-
tionship is confirmed by the p of lidia which both hologically and anato-
mically agree with those of. Badimia pallidula and the closely related B. polillensis (VAIN.)
VEZDA (SÉRUSIAUX 1986; LOCKING et al. 1995). Actually, a generic distinction between
Pseudogyalecta verrucosa and these taxa is not possible. On the other hand, Badimia palli-
dula and its relatives, the so-called B. polillensis-group (LOCKING et al. 1995), cannot be
separated from the generic type, B. dimidiata (BABINGT. ex LEIGHT.) VEZDA, although the
B. polillensis-group exhibits some differences in apothecial morphology and anatomy if
compared to the rest of the genus, e.g. the translucent apothecia, the external apothecial
development, and the lack of excipular crystals (LOCKING et al. 1995). This means that the
generic names Pseudogyalecta and Badimia are synonymous#Misc-exposition*]

[@At present, the genus Badimia comprises nine species which play an important role in
the foliicolous lichen flora in both the neotropical and paleotropical region (LOCKING et al.
1995). Thus, if Pseudogyalecta is accepted as the valid name for this genus, this would
create a large number of unfortunate nomenclatural changes. Moreover, due to its asco-
spore septation and lack of excipular crystals, Pseudogyalecta verrucosa is not a typical
member of Badimia, the latter being more appropriately characterized by B. dimidiata and
its relatives, including t the B. elegans-group (SÉRUSIAUX 1986; LOCKING et al. 1995). We#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new species of Diaporthe and its new Phomopsis anamorph are
described as D. eucalypticola K. M. Old & Z. Q. Yuan sp. nov. and
P. eucalypticola K. M. Old & Z. Q. Yuan sp. nov. based on
isolations from stem wounds in Eucalyptus spp. in Australia.
Morphological differences and similarities between the new
species and related species of Diaporthe and Phomopsis are
discussed. Pathogenicity tests using both seedling and sapling
inoculations indicate that this new species is of low pathogenicity
and is an opportunistic wound coloniser and saprophyte.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During a survey of fungi infecting harvesting wounds of residual
regrowth forest trees at Cabbage Tree Creek, Victoria, Australia, a
coelomycetous fungus was frequently isolated from stem wounds in
Eucalyptus globoidea Blakely and E. sieberi L. Johnson. The fruiting
structures of both the anamorph and teleomorph of this fungus were
successfully induced by inoculating seedling stems and excised twigs.
Morphological examination showed it to be a member of the genus
Diaporthe Nitschke with a Phomopsis anamorph. Because there are no
known species in Diaporthe to accommodate it we propose the new
species as Diaporthe eucalypticola and its anamorph as Phomopsis
eucalypticola sp. nov. The pathogenicity of the fungus was tested.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type material is deposited in the Herbarium of the Institute
for Horticultural Development (VPRI) in Melbourne, Australia and the
isotypes in the National Herbarium of Canada in Ottawa (DAOM) and

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]
[@The isolates of the fungus examined in this study were associated
with stem wounds of Eucalyptus spp. The anamorph and teleomorph#Misc-exposition*]
[@508#Page-header*]

[@were induced artificially in vitro and in vivo. The fungal isolation,
induction of fruiting and pathogenicity test procedures were as follows:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolation#Misc-exposition*]

[@Small pieces, about 0.5-1.0 cm square were cut from discoloured
sapwood of Eucalyptus spp. The wood pieces were washed with sterile
distilled water (SDW) and rinsed with 70% ethanol, then surface-
sterilised with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, and finally rinsed with
SDW again. They were then plated onto 3% malt agar (MA). The
plates were incubated at 17°C in darkness until mycelium appeared
(approx. 6 days), then subcultured to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and
incubated at 20°C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Induction of fruiting#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolates were subcultured onto PDA in plastic Petri dishes. After
about 7 days incubation in darkness at 17°C the Petri dishes were sealed
with laboratory film and were incubated on a bench, under a diurnal
cycle of 12 hours fluorescent light with near-UV component (40W "True-
Lite’, from Duro-lite Corp. NJ) and 12 hours darkness, at room
temperature until sporulation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures on sterilised eucalypt twigs were also used to induce
sporulation. Twigs about 0.5 cm in diam and 4 cm long cut from healthy
eucalypt branches were placed in polycarbonate tissue culture tubes
which contained moist cotton wool. The tubes with twigs were
autoclaved for 20 min. at 120°C. PDA pieces about 0.5 cm square, taken
from one week-old cultures grown in darkness at 20°C were inoculated
onto twigs. After incubation in darkness at 20°C for two days the
inoculated twigs were exposed to light (as described above) until
sporulation was evident.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pathogenicity tests#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pathogenicity of this fungus was tested against 1-year-old
seedlings of seven of the species that constitute the mixed-species
eucalypt stands of the region, namely E. baxteri (Benth.) Maiden &
Blakely ex J. Black, E. botryoides Smith, E. cypellocarpa L. Johnson,
E. globoidea, E. muelleriana A. Howitt, E. obliqua L'Her. and E.
sieberi. A stem wound inoculation method (Old & Kobayashi, 1988)
was used with five seedlings of each species being inoculated with fungal
mycelium growing on a mixture of rice and wheat bran. Each seedling
also received a second wound which was inoculated with sterile bran.
Trees were harvested after 3 months and stem lesions were measured.
For comparison, trees in the same trial were inoculated with the
recognised eucalypt canker pathogen, Endothia gyrosa (Schw.: Fr.) Fr.
(Walker, Old & Murray, 1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sapling inoculation:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pathogenicity tests were also conducted on 13-year-old E. sieberi
at Cabbage Tree Creek. Dominant and codominant trees were selected#Misc-exposition*]
[@509#Page-header*]
[@and 6 replicate trees were inoculated with the Diaporthe isolate, and for
several other putative pathogens including E. gyrosa. Each tree was
wounded to the depth of the sapwood using a surface sterilised 5 mm
diam increment borer at three equidistant points around the stem
circumference and two wounds were inoculated with fungi, the
remaining wound being treated with sterile bran. After 6 months the
extent of bark necrosis was measured and the stems of the standing trees
were dissected with chisels to ascertain the extent of sapwood
discolouration. Sapwood samples were taken for reisolation of the
inoculated fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Average radial growth rate of colonies on PDA at 20'C in
darkness approximately 7.5 mm per day; colonies initially are white,
velvety, with a characteristic fine swirling growth pattern during the first
few days of growth after inoculation. Colonies become buff and cottony
or floccose with mycelium raised in two or three concentric irregular
circles about the colony centre and turn grey under exposure to
fluorescent lights; reverse yellow brownish, yellow brown or dark amber-
coloured, sometimes with brown to black blotches. After 7-10 day's
exposure of the culture under lights, fruit bodies started to form on agar
separately or in groups of 3-5. All cultures produced abundant
conidiomata under the above conditions. However, only two, ORB67
and ORB86, produced both o-conidia and B-conidia.#Description*]

[@No teleomorph was produced on PDA for any culture in darkness
or under fluorescent light with a near-UV component. However, old
colonies in darkness formed sparsely occurring globules, often on Petri
dish wall, with dark brown exudate. These might be possible
ascostromatal initials of the fungus. As the culture ORB67 was derived
from a single ascospore of the teleomorph (DFR 203) which was
produced by inoculating the isolate ORBI onto autoclaved excised twigs
of Eucalyptus sp, there is no doubt of the linkage of the anamorph and
the teleomorph.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The anamorph of the present species was isolated frequently from
stem wounds on living trees and the teleomorph was produced by
inoculating the anamorph onto living seedlings and onto autoclaved
twigs. The features of the teleomorph from both inoculations are
consistent, except for the beaks of the ascomata which extended much
more strongly under the conditions of the twig inoculations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Diaporthe and Phomopsis have been described on
Eucalyptus spp. D. eucalypti Harkn., described from leaves of
Eucalyptus globolus in California, USA (Saccardo, 1886) is regarded as a
synonym of the collective species D. medusaea Nitschke according to
Wehmeyer (1933). This species has been known from numerous host
plants (Kobayashi, 1970; Wehmeyer, 1933). The present Diaporthe
fungus isolated from stem wounds of Eucalyptus spp. is closely similar to
D. medusaea or D. eucalypti in the formation of elongated beaks and the
size of ascospores. However, they differ from each other in some other
characteristics:#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ascomata of this new species are loosely or separately
arranged above a blackened marginal zone deep in the wood, mostly#Misc-exposition*]
[@513#Page-header*]
[@shallowly immersed under the periderm with the majority of the neck
extending outside the plant tissue, while those in D. medusaea are deeply
immersed and the necks collectively erumpent through the peridermal
layers (Kobayashi, 1970).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new species has elongated-ellipsoid to somewhat cylindrical
ascospores and mostly inequilateral (slightly allantoid) with both ends
rounded, rather than ellipsoid-fusoid tapering at ends and straight as in
D. medusaea (Kobayashi, 1970; Wehmeyer, 1933).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although ascospores with short, narrow appendages have been
previously recorded in some species of the genus Diaporthe (Barr, 1978;
Kobayashi, 1970; Wehmeyer, 1933), no indication of such appendages
has been recorded on ascospores of D. medusaea or D. eucalypti
(Harkness, 1884; Kobayashi, 1970; Wehmeyer, 1933). The ascospores of
this new species, however, often bear one, 2-3 uum long, delicate setose
appendage at each end.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phomopsis rudis (Fr.) Hoehn., the anamorph of D. medusaea, has
much longer ß-conidia than those of the new species. The f-conidia of P.
rudis measure 17-30 x 0.5-1 µm (mean 24.6 x 0.9 uum) (Kobayashi, 1970)
or 21-30 x 1.5 µm (Nitschke, 1870), while ours are 10-14 x 1-1.4 µm
(mean 11.9 x 1.1 uum) in size.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phomopsis eucalypti Zerova (Bot. Zurn. 1: 307, 1940), described
from living and dead twigs of Eucalyptus sp in a greenhouse in the
former USSR has been recorded causing severe leaf spot disease of
seedlings of several Eucalyptus species in India (Mohanan & Sharma,
1987). However this Phomopsis species has larger B-conidia than the
proposed new species measuring 20-25 x 1.5-1.8 µm (Uecker, 1988) or
15.4-25 µm long (Mohanan & Sharma, 1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The occurrence of necks on some conidiomata of this new species
was observed on inoculated twigs and in culture on PDA (ORB752). This
is unusual and might be a characteristic in Phomopsis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although D. medusaea has not been reported on eucalypts within
Australia, we believe that the proposed new species is a different but
closely related and undescribed species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pathogenicity to seedlings and saplings#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the Diaporthe species induced bark necrosis and was
readily isolated from inoculated seedlings after 3 months, stem lesions
were small, mean increase over controls for the seven eucalypt species
varying from 7 mm in E. obliqua to 22 mm in E. cypellocarpa, and many
lesions had healed. In contrast an isolate of E. gyrosa had induced
necrotic lesions considerably longer than these (94 mm in E.
cypellocarpa, the most susceptible species) and girdling was almost
complete in some instances.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saplings inoculated in the field with Diaporthe were little
affected, with bark lesions not significantly different in length from
controls (30 mm). External lesions caused by E. gyrosa were 40-50 mm
in length, the main difference between the fungi being in sapwood
discolouration which was 30 mm on average for Diaporthe and 70-110#Misc-exposition*]
[@514#Page-header*]

[@mm for two isolates of E. gyrosa. The restriction of Diaporthe to
sapwood close to the point of inoculation was consistent with its recovery
from naturally infected wounds. Although the fungus could be isolated
from wounds two years after sapwood exposure, it was never found at the
extending margin of discoloured sapwood within the stem, distal to the
wound. In contrast, after 12 months, E. gyrosa was isolated from this
niche in 50% of all dissected stems.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It must be concluded that the Diaporthe isolates studied here are
weak pathogens or saprophytes which appear to be opportunistic wound
colonisers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius gymnocarpus R. Heim ex Singer, first described from
Guinea, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, later validly described from Liberia, is
very different from the "L. gymnocarpus" which HEIM described afterwards
from Zaire. Examination of 99 collections, mainly from African miombo
woodland, revealed six new species, all allied to Lactarius gymnocarpus: L.
pseudogymnocarpus, L. longisporus, L. gymnocarpoides, L. luteopus, L.
medusae and L. flammans. A key to the species is given.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius gymnocarpus was invalidly described by HEIM in 1943,
from the rainforest of West Africa (Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Guinea).
Three of the cited specimens are conserved in the National Museum of
Natural History of Paris (PC). No type-specimen was indicated. SINGER
provided a Latin diagnosis in 1946 based on a specimen from Liberia. In
1955 HEIM redescribes L. gymnocarpus in a revision of Lactarius for the
"Flore Iconographique des Champignons du Congo". He gave a superfluous
Latin diagnosis and completed his earlier description (1943) with data from
the collections of Mme GOOSSENS-FONTANA from Zaire.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A detailed study of the available material revealed that there are
different species belonging to a complex group. The original specimens from
HEIM and the specimen from SINGER represent the same species. The#Misc-exposition*]
[@516#Page-header*]

[@specimens from Zaire, which HEIM cited in 1955, clearly represent another
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@This study was based on herbarium material from the National
Botanic Garden of Belgium (BR), the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh
(E), the Farlow Herbarium of the Harvard University (FH), Universiteit Gent
(GENT), the University of Helsinki (H), the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew
(K), the National Museum of Natural History of Paris (PC) and the personal
herbaria of Bart Buyck (BUYCK) and Daniel Thoen (THOEN). An
important part of the macroscopical features is based on field notes of my
own collections from Burundi (deposited at BR and GENT).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic features are studied in congored in NH,OH or L,
(CLEMENGON, 1972) (eventually after a short passage in KOH 10% solution).
Spore ornamentation is described and illustrated as it appears in Melzer’s
reagent. Line drawings are made with the aid of a drawing tube at
magnifications 6700x for spores, 3200x for individual elements and 1100x
for sections and surface views. Stippling indicates refractive contents in
cystidia and lactifers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores are measured in side view, excluding the ornamentation and
measures are given as (MINa) [AVa-2*SD] - AVa - AVb - [AVb + 2*SD]
(MAXb) in which AVa = lowest mean value for the measured collections,
AVb = greatest mean value and SD = standard deviation. Q stands for
"quotient length/width" and is given as (MINQa) Qa - Qb (MAXQb) in
which Qa, resp. Qb, stand for the lowest, resp. the highest, mean quotient
for the measured specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colour codes are from KORNERUP & WANSCHER (1978). L+l/cm
means number of lamellae (L) and number of lamellulae (1) per cm at pileus
mid-radius. Names of phytogeographical regions and vegetation types are
according to WHITE (1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Lactarius gymnocarpus-complex is characterised by mainly
vividly coloured (orange-like) species with thick and distant, decurrent
lamellae. The spores have a very low ornamentation, mostly forming an
incomplete reticulum, although isolated warts can be distinct. The plage is
mostly amyloid. The suprapellis of the pilei- and stipitipellis is composed of#Description*]
[@517#Page-header*]

[@thick-walled, usually hairshaped elements; the subpellis is
pseudoparenchymatous. The trama of the lamellae is heteromerous.#Description*]

[@Six new species are described in the Lactarius gymnocarpus-
complex. The most important characters to distinguish the species are the
colours of stipe, pileus and lamellae, the shape, the dimensions (Fig. 1) and
the ornamentation of the spores, the presence and abundance of
macropleurocystidia and the shape and size of the elements in pilei- and
stipitipellis. Because of the lack of complete data on some specimens, some
additional undescribed species are included in the key to focus attention on
their existence.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1928 BEELI described L. goossensiae without indicating a type-
specimen. A re-examination of the three cited collections revealed that
GOOSSENS-FONTANA 547 and GOOSSENS-FONTANA 213 are Lactarius
gymnocarpus sensu stricto; GOOSSENS-FONTANA 268 represents a different
species. L. goossensiae has, therefore, to be considered a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

ectomycorrhizal host: L. gymnocarpus seems to be restricted to the Guineo-
Congolian Region (rain forest), in contrast with L. longisporus and L.
luteopus which until now have only been found in the miombo woodland of
the Zambezian Region. Those data are represented in a distribution map

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. The macroscopical description is primarily based on the description
of Pegler (1977) completed with notes from GOOSSENS-FONTANA (1955;
specimens from Zaire). There is a serious contradiction concerning the taste
and smell. PEGLER (1977) describes the taste as "mild" and the smell as
"none", while HEIM mentions a "very acrid" taste and "acrid and pepper-
like" smell, based on observations made by M"* GOOSSENS-FONTANA.
Interpreting organoleptic characters noted by GOOSSENS-FONTANA must be
done with caution, since her taste was strongly affected by the use of kinin
(HEINEMANN, pers. comm.). The macrochemical characters are based on the
notes of GOOSSENS-FONTANA. The microscopical description is based on
GOOSSENS-FONTANA 899 and GOOSSENS-FONTANA 3001. The spores from
PEGLER T497 measure 7.4-8.6-9.7 x 5.9-6.7-7.5 µm (Q - 1.17-/.28-1.45).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. Coloured illustrations are provided by HEIM (1955a: pl. 13, fig. la.c

2, fig. la.c-e).#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. HEIM (1955) noticed that there are differences in venation of the
pileus and taste of context and latex, between what he calls "la forme
guinéenne" and the collections of Mme GOOSSENS-FONTANA. The
remarkable differences in spore-dimensions and pileipellis-structure,
however, make it clear that both "forms" concern different species. L.
gymnocarpus has smaller spores (6.3-7.7-8.2-8.8 x 5.3-5.9-6.4-7.3 µm) and
the elements of the suprapellis of the pileus and the stipe are very irregularly

rounded, often tortuous, with thickened wall (1-3 µm). L. pseudo-#Misc-exposition*]

Hypoxylon (Miller, 1961). The fungus discussed here
greatly resembles Nemania bipapillata (Berk. & M. A.

[@To commemorate the bicentennial of the birth of Elias
Fries (1794-1878), the Swedish Museum of Natural History,
Stockholm, has published this catalog. The catalog documents
the paintings prepared by a series of artists under Fries's
direction beginning in 1845. There were at least 2088
paintings prepared, of which 1789 are extant in the Swedish
Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, the Fytoteket in
Uppsala and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. In all, 1641 taxa
were illustrated. The main body of this book documents these
illustrations, providing information on the locality of the
illustrated specimen, a unique plate number, date of
preparation of the plate, reference to the plates in Fries's
works, the artist(s), and remarks and comments. The names
used are Fries's; nomenclature and taxonomy have not been
updated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The body of this work is the catalog itself but the
introduction is useful and informative; color illustrations of
several of the plates, Fries himself, and a landscape add
interest. The introduction is biographical in the broadest
sense and therefore sets the stage for the production of the
plates and their use in several publications. The most notable
use of some of them, and perhaps the best known, was in the
Icones selectae Hymenomycetum nondum delineatorum by
Fries (1867-1884) in which 560 species were illustrated in two
volumes. The originals, cataloged here, not only represent a
number of unpublished plates but also are said in some cases to
be more accurate than the published illustrations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Using the plates and the documentation contained in
this catalog, agaricologists and those working with other large
basidiomycetes have the opportunity to expand upon the often
scant descriptions provided by Fries, and thus they may be
aided in the formulation of more accurate concepts of the
species he discussed. Certain of the plates may prove#Misc-exposition*]
[@558#Page-header*]

[@important as nomenclatural types in cases where specimens
are lacking (since Fries often did not keep specimens, the
importance of the plates is greater than might initially
appear). Whatever the case, one could not ask for a better
finding aid and study guide than has been presented here. One
might, however, ask that entries be consistently in
alphabetical order or that an erratum sheet be included to
assure that the user does not overlook entries. Alas, the early
pages of the index including Agaricus species a-c are jumbled
although the pages are consecutively numbered. This is an
unfortunate occurrence in an otherwise well prepared and
presented document.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I used this catalog to seek documentation of a set of
plates prepared by Cecilia Berkeley, daughter of the Rev. M. J.
Berkeley, which are now housed in the Farlow Library. These
were said to be drawn from illustrations provided by Fries
upon which I commented (Mycologia 84: 911-912, 1992). Some
of the illustrations were based on the Fries materials located at
Kew as previously noted by R. W. G. Dennis. The Berkeley
copies in the Farlow Library are not mentioned by Strid but I
was able to determine that Cecilia Berkeley copied plates which
are now present in the collection at Uppsala in addition to
those at Kew. I was not able to find definitively in the
Berkeley copies any of the plates listed among those that have
been noted as lost or destroyed by Strid. Interestingly in many
cases annotations agree between those listed in the index and
those on the Berkeley copies. There are a few cases of taxa that
are included in the Berkeley copies that are not found in this
catalog but this may be due to name changes on the original
plates subsequent to Berkeley having made the copies. Strid
points out that many of the plates were copied by Fries's artists
and that there is some level of duplication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The papers are diverse in subject, area of coverage, and
length. Each paper adheres to the mandate of the conference,
namely to discuss the state of knowledge on conservation,
systematics, and ecology of tropical lichens. Twenty-five
presentations were made and seventeen of them have been
published in this work. Individual contributions include the
following: 1) "Biogeographical relationships of Pacific tropical
lichen floras." D. J. Galloway states that a palaeotropical
macrolichen flora, based on modern concepts of lichen
taxonomy, is urgently needed. 2) "The lichen genus Relicina
in Australasia." J. A. Elix discusses Relicina, one of Hale's
Parmelia segregates, with regard to morphological and
chemical evolutionary trends and geographical distribution.
Australasia is home for 34 of the 38 known species of this
lichen. Chemistry is an important species character and is
useful in determining evolutionary direction.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Chemosyndromic variations and divergences are illustrated in
some species complexes. 3) “Lichen conservation in Hawaii."
C. W. Smith feels that the Hawaiian lichen flora is much less
endemic than thought. The richest phorophyte lichen flora is
found in cloud forests above 1000 m. Lava flows are quickly
colonized by mainly Stereocaulon species. Lichen
communities in different habitats are outlined. 4) "The
tropical Pacific species of Usnea and Ramalina and their
relationships to species in other parts of the world." G. N.
Stevens discusses the tropical and temperate origins of
maritime and montane species of Usnea and Ramalina and
gives distribution maps of various species complexes. 5)
"Evolutionary rates in the Teloschistaceae." I. Karnefelt
discusses problems associated with geographical speciation in
Caloplaca, Teloschistes, and Xanthoria, mostly from the African
flora. Two cladograms support the assumed unnatural
relationships between genera in the Teloschistaceae.
Karnefelt believes that evolutionary rates among lichenized
fungi are slow and some groups may have remained
unchanged for millions of years. This view, however, is in
contradiction to the molecular findings of Paula DePriest who
feels that "genomes of lichen-forming fungi not only can
evolve but can evolve rapidly." 6) "Ultrastructure of
subtropical crustose lichens." S. C. Tucker, S. W. Matthews, and
R. L. Chapman report on the ultrastructure of 13 species of
Louisiana lichens, all of them with trentepohliaceous
photobionts belonging to the genera Cephaleuros, Phycopeltis
and Trentepohlia. Intraparietal haustoria and concentric
bodies were present in all lichens. 7) "On the importance of
botanical gardens for lichens in the Asian tropics." L.#Misc-exposition*]
[@560#Page-header*]

[@Arvidsson finds that botanical gardens are important refuges
and can serve as genetic banks for lichens. He explores the
possibility of transplanting rare and endangered species to
such gardens. 8) "Observations on the composition and
distribution of the 'Lobarion' in forests of South East Asia." P.
A. Wolseley found that one feature of the palaeotropical
Lobarion is its high proportion of cyanolichens which allow
them to fix nitrogen and photosynthesize at low light
intensities. 9) "Spore ontogeny of Sphaerophorus diplotypus
and S. fragilis." M. Wedin observed concentric bodies in young
stages of ascospores. He concludes that Sphaerophorus sensu
lato as presently known is heterogeneous and includes at least
two groups that deserve generic rank. 10) "Tropical
pyrenocarpous lichens: A phylogenetic approach." A. Aptroot
presents a cladistic analysis of pyrenocarpous lichens, which
are most diverse in the tropics. These lichens probably have
evolved several times from non-lichenized fungi. An appendix
gives a key to taxa of pyrenocarpous lichens and related non-
lichenized ascomycetes. Five of the remaining chapters
concern floristic studies, from Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, the
Guianas, Tanzanian montane rainforests, and San Paulo State,
Brazil. Finally, two chapters treat foliicolous lichens from
Xishuangbanna (southern China) and Tanzania, respectively.
In the latter, H. Krog discusses a tree frog mimic which had
patches on its back that resembled foliicolous lichens. A
curious fact that I have noted about these lichens is that
despite their short life cycles and rapid growth rates, none
have been isolated into culture, suggesting a high degree of
specialization.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most papers address the dangers facing lichen
communities. These include urbanization, tourism, logging
and forest clearance, agriculture, mining, fire, and erosion.
In an epilogue, T. D. V. Swinscow states, "We are all acutely
aware of how tragically uncertain is the future of natural
habitats in the tropics, whether from the impact of man's tools
locally, or from the influence of climatic changes that he may
be bringing about."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clearly, the papers presented in this volume have
furthered our understanding of tropical lichens and lichen
communities and will serve as important reference points for
future studies. With all the attention being paid nowadays to
the destruction and preservation of tropical rainforests, it is
important that lichenologists point out that lichens also are an
important and still relatively unexplored part of these
ecosystems. Vernon Ahmadjian, Department of Biology, Clark

[@Concern over the ongoing loss of biodiversity has
resulted in the genesis of a new biological discipline:
conservation biology. Unfortunately, loss of biodiversity is
linked to a reduction in human cultural diversity, which
includes indigenous knowledge and uses of fungi and plants.
Thus, it is timely that the National Botanic Garden of Belgium
has published this pair of volumes in which J. Rammeloo and
R. Walleyn seek to document the ethnomycology of southern
Africa through a survey of published accounts. These books
will be of interest to a diversity of readers, including
anthropologists and ethnobotanists, conservationists,
pharmaceutical prospectors, and taxonomic mycologists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The primary purpose of these books is to provide access
to the literature, not to aid in identification. Both volumes
include introductory chapters on the state of scientific
knowledge about African fungi, as well as traditional practices
and their regional variations. A list of references is provided
in both books, but only vol 10 has a taxonomic index (to both
volumes), based on genera. An index to specific epithets would
have been useful. The main parts of both volumes are the
annotated lists of fungal taxa that are reported to be edible (vol
5), or poisonous, medicinal, or otherwise "useful" (vol 10).
Each entry includes the name of the species, the country from
which the report was made, a numerical code to the
reference(s), and, frequently, additional comments. Despite
the bibliographic focus, there is enough information in each
entry, especially in the comments, to make the books useful
and readable without referring to the literature cited. Every
mycologist who picks up these books will immediately want to
check what uses have been found in Africa for their favorite
fungi. Personally, I was intrigued to learn that the sclerotia of
Pleurotus tuberregium (as Lentinus tuberregium) are used not
only as food and medicine, but also to make a base for body
paint in parts of Nigeria.#Misc-exposition*]
[@562#Page-header*]

[@In drawing together the information presented here,
the authors were challenged by the fragmentary nature of the
literature, as well as the inadequacies of a eurocentric
taxonomy for use with African fungi. Authorities have been
provided for the species listed, even though they were
sometimes missing from the original sources. Unfortunately,
there is no indication which names have been thus supplied
with authorities, which renders all species designations
somewhat suspect. A few minor flaws detract from the
presentation, including occasional misspellings and
grammatical errors. These are minor quibbles, however.
These volumes contain an impressive synthesis of information
that will be invaluable for future studies of African
ethnomycology. D.S.H.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Shetland, lying north of mainland Scotland and west of
the southern tip of Norway, is, in Roy Watling's words,
"generally an undulating system of heather clad hills and
valleys bogs and lochs." Weather in Shetland is cool and damp,
with relatively little seasonal fluctuation in mean
temperatures, but is enlivened by "severe gales with their
accompanying high salt-laden winds." This book represents
the results of seven years of collecting by the author and his
collaborators in the often harsh habitats of Shetland.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fifteen pages of introductory material describe the
geography, climate, plant communities, and previous
mycological investigations of Shetland. Several maps show
collecting locations, as well as the distribution of beds of Salix
repens, which are said to harbor an interesting group of
ectomycorrhizal fungi. The bulk of the book consists of a
checklist. All groups of fungi, in the broadest sense, are
treated, including "Phycomycetes" (43 species) and
Myxomycetes (21 species), but the emphasis is clearly on
Basidiomycetes (496 species), Ascomycetes (239 species), and
Deuteromycetes (190 species). Almost all entries include
reference(s) to the literature cited and notes on collection
localities. There are no keys. This book would be easier to use
if any of the following had been provided: an index; a table of
contents; or, a detailed overview of the taxonomic system
employed. Nevertheless, this inexpensive volume is clearly an
essential reference for mycologists working in Shetland (as
well as the Faeroes, Hebrides, efc) and a valuable contribution
to fungal biogeography of the northern hemisphere. D.S.H.#Misc-exposition*]
