JULELLA (ASCOMYCETES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT: The new species Strigula lateralis is described from Portugal and
Ireland, and compared with species of Julella. Notes are given on other species
described in Julella or Polyblastiopsis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of the non-lichenized ascomycete genus Julella Fabre have in the past
attracted little attention. Although none of the known species is lichenized, they have
been studied by lichenologists as much as by mycologists (Barr 1986, Harris 1973).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of the genus have been described originally in Polyblastiopsis,
and many have not been restudied recently. It is a predominantly tropical group of
bark saprophytes. Up to now about 100 species names == been published in
Julella, Catharinia, Peltosphaeria and Polyblasti jon of some
readily available material, however, suggests that only we species exist, most of
which appear to be widely distributed. A key to these species is presented below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many records cited below are new records for the respective countries or
even continents. Only one identified species of Julella has so far been reported from
Portugal (Tavares, 1945, as Polyblastiopsis fallaciosa). In addition, an unknown
species has been reported twice (Tavares 1942, van den Boom 1990). This species,
for which no existing name could be found, is described below. It has also been
found in Ireland and Australia. Although it strongly resembles Julella, it is described
here in Strigula Fries because of the ascospore shape and the conidia which are
referable to Discosiélla Sydow & P. Sydow (Nag Raj 1993), the anamorph of the
genus Strigula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the species concept in the group, an important observation is that
ascospore dimensions tend to be more variable in ascomycetes with large, muriform
spores than in species with smaller, non-muriform spores. This phenomenon can be
observed in many different groups e.g., Graphina, Thelotremataceae, Pyrenulaceae
and Trypetheliaceae. Accordingly, in Julella considerable variation has to be
accepted within the species. The species recognized here are characterized by at least
two correlated characters. Exceptions are J. lactea and J. vitrispora, which differ
only in the number of ascospores per ascus. It remains to be seen whether these
entities are really worth recognition at species level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution: Strigula lateralis has been found on the west side of the
Serra de Sintra, where it was growing on Castanea sativa in a mixed wood. The
Serra de Sintra is situated near the atlantic coast of Portugal, on a peninsula North
of Lisbon. Consequently it has a Mediterranean-Atlantic climate with subtropical
tendencies and is rich in epiphytic lichens. Accompanying species are Bacidia
laurocerasi, Graphis elegans, Enterographa crassa, E. elaborata and Porina
leptalea. In Ireland it was found on Corylus avellana, together with e.g. Pyrenula
coryli on a locality with many rare oceanic species, including Calicium diploellum
on /lex aquifolium (pers. comm. Dr. B. Coppins).#Habitat-distribution*]

ascospores, which are generally smaller (18-21 x 7-8 µm). It may belong to a
different species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: this species differs from all other species of Strigula by the lateral
ostiole and the truly muriform spores. Several other species of Strigula with
muriform spores are known from tropical areas, but none have been described; only
two species have submuriform spores. None of these has lateral ostioles.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thirteen species of Sporidesmium sens. lat. found during an examination of dead
leaves of Freycinetia and of Pandanus are described and figured in the genera Ellis-
embia, Penzigomyces, Ri Spor ium and Stanjehughesia. These
include three new species of ] Ellisembia and one of Sporidesmium. New combina-

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@To date, this series of papers (e.g., McKenzie 1991, McKenzie & Kuthubutheen
1993) has been restricted to hyphomycetes on Freycinetia, one of three genera
in the Pandanaceae. The study has now widened to include hyphomycetes on
dead leaves of Pandanus, the screwpines. There are approximately 600 species
of Pandanus, principally in the Old World tropics, but a few are warm temper-
ate. They are usually trees with prop-roots, characteristically found on the
coast, sometimes in thick groves, but extending to montane forests. Some spe-
cies are cultivated as ornamentals. The leaf fibre from several species is tradi-
tionally plaited into mats, baskets, fans, sails and garments, and is used for
house thatch.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During this study 13 species of Sporidesmium sens. lat. were found, making it
the most diverse of the hyphomycete genera found on Pandanaceae. It occurred
on Freycinetia from all the tropical countries sampled (American Samoa, Cook
Islands, Fiji, Hawaii, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Caledonia, Palau, Solomon
Islands and Western Samoa). However, it was less common in temperate New
Zealand, where only two of a large number of collections yielded Sporides-#Misc-exposition*]

[@10#Page-header*]

[@mium. Pandanus samples collected in Brunei, Hong Kong and Malaysia have
all yielded species of Sporidesmium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sporidesmium sens. lat. is worldwide in distribution, often found on wood or on
plant litter. Many species have been described and illustrated (e.g., Ellis 1958,
1971, 1976). It is a large, disparate genus which has been recently reassessed
by Subramanian (1992). He erected five genera to accommodate most species,
which he separated primarily on the paste of conidial septation (euseptate







versus distoseptate) and conidiogenesis. Euseptate species which either lack or
have irregular conidiophore proliferati remain in Sporidesmium Link. Other
species with euseptate conidia and with annellate conidiophores were placed in

Repetophragma Subram., those with lageniform, ovoid, doliform or nodose
percurrent proliferations in Penzigomyces Subram., and those with the conidio-
phore reduced to a conidi cell in Stanjehughesia Subram. Species with
distoseptate conidia have been placed in three genera: those with irregular
conidiophore proliferations in Ellisembia Subram., those with regular annella-
tions in Sporidesmiella P.M. Kirk, and those with lageniform, ovoid or doliform
percurrent proliferations in Polydesmus Mont.#Habitat-distribution*]



[@This paper describes and illustrates 3 new species of Ellisembia and one of
Sporidesmium, and 8 named species, including three new combinations, previ-
ously described from other substrates, and now placed in Ellisembia, Penzigo-
myces, Repetophragma and Stanjehughesia. The remaining species appears to
be an undescribed Sporidesmium, but lacks sufficient material for a formal
description. Three additional new combinations are made in Ellisembia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are at least 9 previously described species of Sporidesmium sens. lat.
with a mucilaginous sheath enveloping the conidial — Of these, E. vaginata
is most similar to E. gelati: and S. mini, conidia of E.
gelatinosa have fewer septa (4-7) and a differently d basal "cell, while S.
minigelatinosum has narrower conidia (6-8 µm) and short conidiophores (5-15
µm) which are often non-septate. E. vaginata is also similar to E. antillana,
although the latter has wider conidia (16-20 nm) and a projecting basal cell,
and it possesses a noticeably pointed, appendage-like apical cell. The newly
described E. paravaginata has larger and darker conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A NEW SPECIES OF LAMBERTELLA WITH PECULIAR ASCOSPORES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wen-ying Zhuang

Institute of Microbiology, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China#Misc-exposition*]

[@In my examinations of several collections related to the Sclerotiniaceae,
an interesting fungus was encountered. The apothecial anatomy and presence of light
brown ascospores indicated that it might be a member in the genus Lambertella
Hoehn. But a substratal stroma was not found and the spores are scutuloid with a
refractive collar at the narrow end. Lambertellinia Korf & Lizon (1994) which has
scutuloid and brown ascospores is another possibility, but the excipular structure
is different. It is also similar to Hymenoscyphus Gray structurally but the presence
of light brown ascospores does not fit, and such spore appendage are unknown
there, too.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphologically, the closest species appears to be Hymenoscyphus scutulus
(Pers. : Fr.) W. Phillips var. . fucatus W. Phillips for which White (1944) provided
a detailed description and b iful ill i The Hi I is
different from H. scutulus var. fucatus in much smaller and beige-colored apothecia,
wider asci, larger and light brown ascospores, and the presence of a refractive collar
at narrow end of the spore instead of short cilia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore characteristics of the Huangshan fungus are peculiar for any of the
above mentioned genera. Where to place the fungus? To avoid establishing a new
genus, one of them has to be chosen to accommodate this species. Although its
structure and some characters resemble Hymenoscyphus scutulus var. fucatus except
for spores, I prefer not to put this species in Hymenoscyphus since it is a genus
containing diverse species which may not be closely related and has no clear generic
concept. Deep thought has been given to its fitness to Lambertellinia because
of the spore shape and color. Nevertheless, a substratal stroma is not clear and the
ectal excipulum is not of textura porrecta. Lambertella is the last choice. In the
genus Lambertella, L. albida (Rabenh.) Korf possesses somewhat scutuloid
ascospores (White, 1944), but the spores are much smaller [(13-17 X 3-5 µm by
Dennis (1956) vs. 33-43 X 7.0-11.0 am] than the Huangshan collection and a
refractive collar was never recorded. I tentatively place it in Lambertella
and described it as Lambertella torquata,#Misc-exposition*]

containing atranorin, pannarin or gyrophoric acid are
discussed, namely Rinodina alba, R. aspersa, R. atrocinerea,
R. beccariana, R. canariensis, R. confragosa, R. luridescens,
R. occulta, R. oxydata, R. santorinensis, R. trachytica and R.

provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species treated in this paper are characterized by the presence of
particular secondary lichen compounds which can be detected after the
application of reagents (spot tests); atranorin (with chloratranorin),
gyrophoric acid (usually accompanied by traces of lecanoric and orsellinic
acids, see SCHREINER & HAFELLNER 1992: 22) and pannarin. Atranorin reacts
K* yellow, and it is present in all species considered except R. /uridescens.
Gyrophoric acid reacts C+ red and it is present in R. alba, R. aspersa, R.
atrocinerea, R. canariensis and R. luridescens, while pannarin reacts PD
orange and it is present only in R. santorinensis. All these reactions are
Strong and visible under the stereomicroscope.#Misc-exposition*]
[@46#Page-header*]

[@As these lichen substances are presented as crystals, they are also easily
observed under polarizing light. They are particularly concentrated in the
cortical and medullary tissues of the thallus and in the thalline margin, both of
which appear entirely interspersed with crystals. Gyrophoric acid and
pannarin can be also present in the epihymenium and in the proper margin.
Atranorin crystals dissolve in K giving, a yellow coloration; gyrophoric acid
crystals dissolve in C, giving a reddish coloration and pannarin crystals
dissolve in PD, forming orange acicular crystals.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other secondary lichen compounds present in the species treated in this
paper (e.g. zeorin, 2'-0-methylperlatolic and confluentic acids) do not give
spot test reactions and must be detected by TLC.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following lichen compounds have been detected for the first time in the
genus Rinodina: umbilicaric and ovoic acids are biosynthetically related to
gyrophoric acid and present in Rinodina aspersa and R. atrocinerea; 2'-0-
methylsuperlatolic and 2'-0-methylisohyperlatolic/2'-0-methylhyperlatolic acids
are related to 2'-0-methylperlatolic acid, and hyperconfluentic acid is related
to confluentic acid, all of which are present in R. trachytica. Furthermore, a
new depside related to gyrophoric acid has been detected in all specimens of
R. alba analysed by TLC. According to ELix (in litt.) that substance could be
2"-0-methylgyrophoric acid, a still undescribed isomer of umbilicaric and ovoic
acids (this has not yet been confirmed).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ascospores of the species considered belong to four different types: the
Physconia-type (including Milvina-type), in R. luridescens; the Physcia-type in
R. confragosa and R. occulla; the Mischoblastia-type in R. oxydata, R.
trachytica and R. vezdae and the Pachysporaria-type in the other species
treated. Among these species, R. alba, R. aspersa and R. atrocinerea
possess typical Pachysporaria-type ascospores while R. beccariana, R.
canariensis and R. santorinensis have Pachysporaria-type ascospores
showing tendencies towards the Physcia-type (compare fig. 1A-B with 1C).
These were termed by MAYRHOFER et al. (1993) and MaTzER et al. (1994) as
being "similar to the Pachysporaria-type".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mature Pachysporaria- (including the "similar to Pachysporaria-type") and
Mischoblastia-type ascospores are rather similar in appearance but they
should not be confused if their ontogeny is carefully studied. Clear differences
are obvious in the medium stages, since the lumina never become extremely
angular in the Pachysporana-type as occurs in the Mischoblastia-type
(compare figs. 1A-B and 4A-C).#Misc-exposition*]
[@47#Page-header*]

[@All the present species have ascospores which originate via a type A
ontogeny: in young ascospores, the septum is inserted before internal wall-
thickenings (see GiRALT 1994; GiRALT & MAYRHOFER 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The asci are of typical Lecanora-type (sensu HoNEGGER 1978) in Rinodina
alba, R. atrocinerea, R. beccariana, R. canariensis, R. confragosa, R.
luridescens, R. occulta and R. santorinensis and R. trachytica but often show
tendencies towards the Bacidia-type in R. oxydata (RAMBOLD et al. 1994) and
R. vezdae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally, the apothecia are pseudolecanorine from the beginning (DucHv 1952,
CLAuzaDE & Roux 1985, GiRALT 1994) in R. luridescens; lecanorine but
usually becoming pseudolecanorine in R. beccariana var. lavicola, R. occulta
and R. oxydata and cryptolecanorine (SHEARD 1967) in R. trachytica, rather
than typically lecanorine as occurs in the other species considered.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the present paper is devoted to species which occur in the Iberian
Peninsula, new chorologic data from the Balearic and Canary islands and
from North Africa are also mentioned.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@All descriptions are based on our personal examinations. Current mycological
terminology has been employed and generally follows that of HAWKSWORTH et
al. (1983). The terminology for the asci follows that of HONEGGER (1978) and
RAMBOLD et al. (1994) while for the ascospore-types the terminolgy of
MAYRHOFER (1982), ScHEIDEGGER (1993), GiRALT (1994) and GiRALT &
MAYRHOFER (1995) is followed. The standardized methods of thin layer
chromatography (TLC) were employed (e.g. CULBERSON & AMMANN 1979;
CULBERSON et al. 1981; CULBERSON & JOHNSON 1982) for the identification of
lichen substances.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As most of the species considered have previously been described in detail in
other revisional treatments, including those of SHEARD (1967), MAYRHOFER &
POELT (1979), MAYRHOFER (1984), Fox & Purvis (1992), MAYRHOFER et al.
(1993) and MARZER et al. (1994), the descriptions given here simply
emphasize characters of value for species identification and do not repeat
features common to all species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHEMISTRY: Thallus and thalline margin K+ yellow and C+ red,
epihymenium C+ red (microscopic slide!); medulla I+ violet (microscopic

an unknown substance, by TLC. The unknown substance is characterized by
Rf classes 3/3/3 and yellowish colour after visualitation. Those features do
not fit with any of the depsides related to the gyrophoric acid and its relatives
given in ELix et al. (1987). It has been detected in all specimens analysed but
was not previously reported from R. alba (compare LuMBSCH & TITZE 1981;

[@DISCUSSION: Rinodina alba is characterized by the invariably well
developed, continuous, areolate and whitish thallus, the I+ violet medullary
reaction, the small, typical Pachysporaria-type ascospores and its chemistry.
The closely related species, R. atrocinerea and R. canariensis are mainly
distinguished by the lack of medullary reaction with iodine, the significantly
larger ascospores and by the absence of the unknown substance. The
yellowish-orange pigment (usually reacting K+ and C+ purple red) located in
the lower surface of all thalli of R. canarinesis and sometimes also in those of
R. atrocinerea, has not been observed in R. alba. An interesting feature
common to R. alba and R. atrocinerea but absent in R. canariensis, is the
presence in the ascospores of lumina protrudings towards the spore-ends.
Another related species, R. aspersa, is mainly separated by its sorediate
thallus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHEMISTRY: Areolae and soralia K+ yellow and C+ red; atranorin,
gyrophoric acid (with lecanoric and orsellinic acids), umbilicaric acid, ovoic
acid and 5-0-methylhiascic acid, by TLC. Hitherto only atranorin, gyrophoric
and lecanoric acids were reported for this species (FOLLMANN & HUNECK 1970;
LEUCKERT & MAYRHOFER 1984, as R. fatiscens; LAUNDON 1986; Fox & Purvis
1992). Whereas ovoic acid has not previously been reported from the genus
Rinodina, the tridepside 5-0-methylhiascic acid (ELıx & JAYANTHI 1977), has
been detected in Rinodina tephraspis (Tuck.) Herre (MAYRHOFER et al. 1992)
and in a specimen of the South African species, R. huillensis (MATZER &
MAYRHOFER in prep.). The chemistry of the species pair R. aspersa/R.
atrocinerea is close to that of several species of Umbilicaria (compare
Posner et al. 1992) and Lasallia (compare Posner et al. 1991).#Description*]

[@DISCUSSION: Rinodina aspersa is characterized by a thallus composed of
discrete soralia and its chemistry. It is the secondary species of R.
atrocinerea, from which it differs mainly in the production of soredia and the
absence (or scarcity) of apothecia and spermogonia. Both species have
identical chemistry. No former descriptions of fertile specimens of R. aspersa
(MavRHOFER & PoELT 1979, as R. fatiscens; Fox & Purvis 1992) mention
whether the lumina of the ascospores possess protrusions towards the spore-
ends typical of R. atrocinerea and R. alba.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sorediate thallus readily distinguishes R. aspersa from the other species
containing atranorin and gyrophoric acid (e.g. R. alba and R. canariensis) as
well as from the other species treated in the present paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to the various revisions of the genus Rinodina (e.g. MAYRHOFER &
PoELT 1979; MavRHOFER 1984; GiRALT et al. 1995), Rinodina aspersa is the
only sorediate species of the genus which contains gyrophoric acid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION: Although Rinodina aspersa has been
reported from several continental localities (MAYRHOFER & POELT 1979;
MAYRHOFER 1984, as R. fatiscens), it seems to be mainly a maritime species.
It grows on siliceous rocks in coastal sites, from north Scandinavia to south
Portugal. According to LAUNDON (1986) its distribution is declining. It has not
been reported previously from the study area.#Misc-exposition*]

[@54#Page-header*]

[@yellowish-orange pigment in the lower surface of the thallus which reacts K+
and C+ purple red was cited by MATZER et al. (1994) as a distinguishing
character of R. canariensis. Our observations show that this pigment may
also be present in R. atrocinerea. Nevertheless, the latter species cannot be
mistaken for R. canariensis because this species is usually parasitic and has
larger, fusiform and often curved ascospores (which show tendencies
towards the Physcia-type). Other distinguishing features between the taxa
include the absence in R. atrocinerea, of the adpressed mycelium of a
lichenicolous fungus which often covers the thallus of R. canariensis (MATZER
et al. 1994). Furthermore, the ascospores of R. canariensis do not exhibit the
lumina protrudings towards the spore-ends.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some of the specimens of R. at a examined p d ller than
usual ascospores and for this reason they could be confused with R. alba. In
this cases, the absence of the I+ violet medullary reaction and of the
unknown secondary lichen substance separate R. atrocinerea. Other
characters for distinguishing these two species are discussed under R. alba
(see above).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION: Rinodina luridescens is characterized by its chemistry, its
immersed, pseudolecanorine apothecia, its brownish hypothecium and its
Physconia-type ascospores. The absence of atranorin together with the other
distinguishing characters cited separate R. luridescens from the other species
containing gyrophoric acid, as well as from all the other species treated.
According to MAYRHOFER (1984) and MATZER et al. (1994) the ascospores of
R. luridescens belong to the Milvina-type rather than to the Physconia-type.
We include the Milvina-type in the Physconia-type because mature
ascospores are identical in both types: i.e. they only possess septal wall-
thickenings. In intermediate ontogenetic stages ascospores belonging to the
Milvina-type may also possess apical wall-thickenings, while these are quite
rare in the Physconia-type (compare GiRALT 1994; GiRALT & MAYRHOFER
1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION: Rinodina luridescens is a maritime
Mediterranean-Atlantic species, extending as far as the Black Sea (Nimis
1993). It is found in coastal sites, on hard siliceous rocks. In the Iberian
Peninsula it is currently known only from Galicia (MAYRHOFER 1984; BAHILLO
et al. 1987). The records of R. luridescens from Mallorca (Balearic Islands) in
Mus & EGEA (1985) do not refer to a Rinodina species. It has also been

revision is carried out. Under R. oxydata we have included specimens with a
thin thallus containing only atranorin and which have apothecia which usually
become pseudolecanorine and contain large Mischoblastia-type ascospores.
R. vezdae, a member of the R. oxydata-group, differs from the specimens

apothecia which rarely become pseudolecanorine and significantly larger
ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rinodina trachytica, which also possesses Mischoblastia-type ascospores,
can be distinguished from R. oxydata and R. vezdae, by its smaller,

MAYRHOFER 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION: Rinodina oxydata is a widespread
cosmopolitan species, present all over the world (EGAN 1987; Nimis 1993). In

[@DISCUSSION: Rinodina santorinensis is mainly characterized by its typically
lichenicolous, almost subsquamulose thallus, its Pachysporaria-type
ascospores which grade into the Physcia-type when young, and, especially,
by the presence of pannarin. Detailed information i given by MAYRHOFER et

morphologically rather similar in habit and ascospore-type, but are readily
distinguished by their lack of pannarin. The same feature also separates the
other species treated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whereas pannarin seems to be a relatively frequent metabolite among
corticolous Rinodina species, among saxicolous species it is hitherto only
known from R. santorinensis and the Australasian, R. murrayii (MAYRHOFER

[@TLC analyses show that the principal lichen compounds of R. trachytica are
2'-0-methylsuperperlatolic and 2'-0-methylisohyperlatolic and/or 2'-0-

[@71#Page-header*]

[@analyzed, is always present in low concentrations. One of these acids was
previously mentioned as an unknown p-depside of the orcinic type
(MAYRHOFER & LEUCKERT 1985; MAYRHOFER et al. 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to ELix et al. (1987) and CuLBERSON et al. (1987), 2'-0-
methylsuperperlatolic, 2'-0-methylisohyperlatolic and 2'-0-methylhyperlatolic
acids are orcinol-type depsides biosynthetically closely related to the 2'-0-
methylperlatolic acid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Those orcinol-type depsides separate better in solvent B' (CULBERSON &
JOHNSON 1982) and can be identified as follows: the slowest member of the
series corresponds to the well known 2'-0-methylperlatolic acid; the fastest to
2'-0-methylsuperlatolic acid and the chromatographically intermediate to 2'-0-
methylisohyperlatolic and/or 2'-0-methylhyperlatolic acids. The latter two
compounds run together and usually constitute the major secondary product
of R. trachytica (see Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The same array of lichen compounds were found in Haematomma
pachycarpum and in an unidentified Lecanora sp. from India (CULBERSON et
al. 1987). A comparison of this Lecanora (Andhra Pradesh: Warangal, Rao,
s.d. DUKE) with R. trachytica showed that both species contain the 2'-0-
methylperlatolic acid chemosyndrome with identical chromatographic profiles
(see Fig. 2). The same series of compounds have been found in Biatora
sorediosa (Eux & Davin 1991) and in Lecanora jamesii (BRODO & ELIx 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In contrast to literature reports, confluentic acid (with hyperconfluentic acid) is
not always present in R. trachytica. Hyperconfluentic acid is visible in solvent
B' and C and chromatographically is situated just above the confluentic acid
(see Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This constitutes the first reported occurrence of the higher homologues of 2'-
0-methylperlatolic acid and of hyperconfluentic acid from the genus Rinodina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION: Rinodina trachytica is characterized by the thallus of
contiguous, +angulose areolae, the cryptolecanorine apothecia,
Mischoblastia-type ascospores and complex chemistry. Among the species

[@Thallus rather thick, crustose to subsquamulose, areolate or not, usually
continuous, smooth, pale grey to yellowish (ochraceous in herbarium).
Prothallus black, present or not. Apothecia cryptolecanorine to lecanorine,
rarely becoming pseudolecanorine, up to 1 mm diam. When lecanorine or
pseudolecanorine, then adnate. Thalline margin thin, entire, paler than the
thallus, usually persistent. Disc brown, plane to convex. Epihymenium brown.
Hymenium up to 100 µm high. Asci Lecanora-type or, some of them, showing
tendencies to the Bacidia-type. Ascospores Mischoblastia-type, (21-)24-27(-
30) x (10-)12-14(-16) µm, faintly warted; torus poorly developed.#Description*]

[@CHEMISTRY: Thallus and thalline margin K+ and PD+ weakly yellow; traces
of atranorin by TLC. Further data are given by MAYRHOFER (1984).#Description*]

[@DISCUSSION: In our oppinion, the characters used for the delimitation of R.
vezdae fall within the variability of R. oxydata, but until a thorough revision of
the R. oxydata-group is carried out, we refrain from putting them into
synonymy (see comments under R. oxydata).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As with R. oxydata, R. vezdae could not be mistaken for R. trachytica
because of its larger ascospores and different chemistry.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION: The ecology and distribution of Rinodina
vezdae is poorly known, since it has only been reported from a few central
European, submediterranean and Mediterranean localities (MAYRHOFER 1984;
MAYRHOFER 1987; NiMIS 1993). In the Iberian Peninsula so far it is only known
from Castelló (CALATAYUD & BARRENO 1994), where it grows on south-
exposed siliceous rock surfaces, as well as in fissures filled with sand. The
specimens cited below constitute the first records from Balearic Islands and
Morocco. The latter constitutes the most southern locality for this species.#Misc-exposition*]

sporules of which may have been mistaken for Gloeosporium spores, and if so
the species must be abandoned" (Ellis & Everhart, 1900).#Misc-exposition*]

G. alboferrugineum should actually be referred to genus Discosia but it differs
substantially from D. laecola by its morphological and physiological
features. The two species belong to different sections of the genus (Vanev, 1991)

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Five new species of Agaricales are described
and illustrated from southern and southeastern
Yunnan, China. Characters which separate the
species from others are discussed. The new
species are  Gerronema | chrysocarpum,
Phaeomarasmius | neoaffinis, Pyrrhoglossum
yunnanensis, Phaeocollybia sparsilamellae and
Crepidotus neocystidiosus. All specimens cited
in this paper have been deposited in the
Cryptogamic Herbarium, Kunming Institute of
Botany, Academia Sinica (HKAS).#Misc-exposition*]

[@During a recent investigation of the higher fungi in southern
and southeastern Yunnan, China, 1442 collections were
obtained. A number of species of Agaricales have been
identified by comparing descriptions written in published books
and papers or comparing type specimens. Among them five
higher fungi are reported as new species in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note: The cream to yellow colours of the pileus and the

that this species belongs in the sect. Xanthophylla Singer of the
genus Gerronema Singer. The overall macroscopic appearance
and habit closely approaches that of the African species C.
longipes Pegler (Pegler, 1977; 1986), which differs in the
absence of cystidia and the narrow ellipsoid spores (5.5-8 X
2.8-3.7 µm). At first glimpse G. chrysocarpum could be taken
for the neotropical species C. cheilocystidiatum Sing., but the
latter's cheilocystidia (14- 18 X 7-8.84 µm) and spores (4.5-6 X
3-3.5 aim) are smaller and pleurocystidia are absent (Singer,#Misc-exposition*]
[@93#Page-header*]
[@1970a). The presence of pleurocystidia suggests that the
infrageneric relationships of this species might be in the sect.
Fibula (Singer) Sing., close to G. fibula (Bull.) Singer, but G.
fibula differs in the slender basidiocarp, smaller spores and the
absence of cheilocystidia (Singer, 1970a; Pegler, 1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the last years, several papers about the fungi of the island Ilha do Cardoso has
been published (Bononi, 1979a, 1979b, 1979c, 1984; Bononi & Capelari, 1984; Bononi et al.,
1984; Trufem, 1988, Capelari, 1989), but the only contribution to the knowledge of the
Polyporaceae of the Island is that of Bononi (1979a, 1979c) who found two hydnoid species:
Hydnopolyporus fimbriatus (Fr.) Reid. and H. hartmannii (Mont) Reid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Iiha do Cardoso is located in Sào Paulo State, Brazil, between 25°03'05*-25018'18"
latitude S, and 47°53'48" - 48005'42" longitude W.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The island is lagerly mountainous, and the central region is dominated by a massif of
over 800m, composed of metamorphic rocks (gneisses and micaschists) with magmatic outcrops
(granite). Climate is affected by local factors, like humidity, topography, and vegetation. Its
megathermic climate is superhumid, with no water shortage and considerable excess in
summer; average annual temperature is 21.20C (Barros et al., 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@All vegetation types occurring along the Brazilian coast are present in Ilha do Cardoso:
pioneer dune vegetation, “restinga” vegetation, coastal plain rain-forest, Serra do Mar tropical#Misc-exposition*]

[@rain-forest and mangrove (Noffs & Baptista-Noffs, 1982; Barros et al. 1991). "Restinga” is a
complex of vegetation formations that show differences in physiognomy and are distributed in a
mosaic in sandy plains. In Ilha do Cardoso, the "restinga’vegetation cover the most part of sandy
plain, inside and in adjacents areas of pioneer dune vegetation (Barros et al., 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungi were collected during a period of two years, from January, 1990, to December,
1991, trying to cover the four seasons. The herbarium material deposited in the Herbario

[@Summary.- Boletus queletii var. discolor (Quél.) Alessio, a rare fungus, is
described and commented upon; besides, a comparative study of its sporal
parameters, with Boletus queletii var. queletii, B. queletii var. zugazae, B.
queletii var. rubicundus, B. queletii var. lateritius and B. erythropus, is
realized. The study confirms its taxonomic status as a variety of B. queletii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boletus queletii var. discolor (Quél.) Alessio belongs
to section Luridi Fr., a relatively well defined group in
the genus Boletus L.: Fr. (cf. SINGER, 1986), in which
several studies have been realized recently (e.g. ANDARY &
al., 1992; TREU, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The purpose of this paper, besides realizing a
taxonomic study on this rare bolete known exclusively from
Bulgaria (KUTHAN & KOTLABA, 1981), France (COURTECUISSE &
DUHEM, 1994; QUELET, 1888), Italy (ALESSIO, 1985), the
Slovakian Republic (DERMEK & al., 1976), and Spain, is to
stress that contrary to what is generally thought there are
indeed useful microscopic characters in the genus Boletus
which contribute to taxonomic classification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since its original description by QUÉLET (1.c.), this
taxon has successively been considered as a variety of
Boletus luridus Schaeff.: Fr. (QUÉLET, l.c.), a subspecies
of B. erythropus Pers. (DERMEK & al., l.c.), a synonym of
B. junquilleus (Quél.) Boud. (GILBERT, 1931), an
independent species (BIGEARD & GUILLEMIN, 1909), a form of
B. queletii Schulzer (e.g. BERTAUX, 1960; PARROT, 1964) or
as a variety of B. queletii (ALESSIO, 1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The latter is due to the fact that species
delimitation in the boletes, and consequently their
taxonomy, has been largely based upon macroscopic features.
Microscopic characters have been considered, generally, as
having little importance, since they are very homogeneous
among the majority of the taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@So species which are very similar microscopically may
be very different from a macroscopical point of view.
Characters such as size of basidiocarps, colours, etc.
(though we must not overestimate their taxonomic value) are#Misc-exposition*]
[@116#Page-header*]

[@very important to separate one species from another.
Experience shows us that, as happens in other genera such
as Cortinarius (Pers.) Gray, it is absolutely indispensable
to study this genus in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nevertheless, it is necessary to stress the importance
of several microscopic characters whose taxonomic value has
been assessed since some years ago. Reaction of all parts
of the basidiocarps with Melzer’s reagent should always be
considered, as stated by some authors (e.g. HEINEMANN &
RAMMELOO, 1982; TREU, l.c.), though others like ALESSIO
(1985, 1993) do not attach much importance to this. Another
important point is spore behaviour with this reagent.
HEINEMANN & RAMMELOO (1l.c.) indicated that no bolete is
known with amyloid spores, but that in some species the
latter are clearly dextrinoid. For this reason it would be
necessary to test spores systematically for this reaction.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Furthermore, sporal parameters which are usually very
homogeneous within this genus, may be studied with the help
of statistical methods (cf. HEINEMANN & RAMMELOO, 1985),
the latter being able to provide additional information for
species delimitation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present case of Boletus queletii var. discolor
the study of both its sporal parameters and its behaviour
with Melzer’s reagent confirms the taxonomic status of this
fungus as a variety of B. queletii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this work, besides giving a description of this
taxon, a comparative study of the sporal parameters and
their amyloidity (both from original material and
bibliographic data) with other varieties of Boletus
queletii and with B. erythropus, is realized.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopical observations, unless stated
otherwise, were made in KOH 2% [according to BARAL (1992)
higher concentrations may produce dramatic spore
shrinkings, at least in many ascomycetes, contrary to what
is commonly thought]. However, all parts of basidiocarps
were also checked in Melzer’s reagent.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The method followed to measure as well as to
characterize the spores is the one proposed by HEINEMANN &
RAMMELOO (1985). For this purpose I have always measured at
least 20 mature spores lying on a hymenial mount of a
mature specimen, and mean values (X) of length (L), width
(1) and Q coefficient (L/1), as well as their corresponding
standard deviations (0), were calculated with a spreadsheet
(FW2). The values which are higher or lower than x + 20 are
quoted within parentheses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microphotographs have been realized with a Nikon
microscope model Labophot, with automatic photographic
system AFX-DX and phase-contrast, and with a Zeiss-950 SEM.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: This taxon shows a closer relationship with
Boletus queletii than with B. erythropus. With the former
it shares the tramal amyloid reaction, the wine-red colour
of the base of the stipe (both inside and outside) and the#Misc-exposition*]
[@120#Page-header*]

[@significantly lower Q coefficient than that of B.
erythropus (see table 1). It differs from B. queletii
because of the colours both of pileus and stipe, as well as
through the dense granulation which completely covers the
stipe; the latter brings it close to B. erythropus. Because
of the absence of a reticulum on the stipe, the strong
bluing of context and the yellow colours, this fungus can
be confused in the field with a yellow form of B.
erythropus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A good illustration of this taxon has been published
by ENGEL & al. (1983: 95). DERMEK & al. (1976) were the
first authors to describe more or less accurately this
taxon. They did however overlook some characters, such as
the presence of vascular hyphae, the amyloid hyphae in the
context (contrary to what they indicated) and the Q
coefficient whose value is approximately 2. In any case,
this taxon has never been illustrated microscopically.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since the record of this bolete in my country in 1990,
I went back regularly to the same locality, year after
year, hoping to find it again, but without being
successful. Besides, I have been looking for it in similar
habitats and at different sites, with the same negative
results. As for the commonness or rarity of this taxon I
want to refer to MAY’s (1988) article in which he indicates
that "intuitive ideas about commonness and rarity usually
make reference both to geographical distribution and to
local abundance". According to this author, there are eight
different categories, only one of them being the so-called
common species, i.e. organisms with a broad distribution,
unspecialized habitat and large populations. Boletus
queletii var. discolor neither presents a very narrow
distribution, as it occurs in different biogeographic areas
(our material was collected in the Mediterranean region,
though it also is known from the Eurosiberian one), nor a
very wide one. This, together with a specialized habitat
and very small populations, seems to define it as a fairly
rare taxon. Apparently it is only distributed in Central
and Southern Europe, in termophilous woods, forming
ectomycorrhizal associations with Quercus species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In view of Table 1 we can see that, in spite of a
great sporal variability, the mean values remain more or
less constant within narrow ranges. We can notice that mean
values of the spore length of Boletus erythropus are higher
than those of B. queletii, whereas mean values of sporal
width are lower in the former and higher in the latter.
This altogether leads to a mean Q coefficient that in B.
erythropus is approximately 3, whereas in B. queletii it is
approximately 2, which is quite significant. Besides var.
discolor also has a mean Q value of approximately 2, which
supports its relationship with B. queletii rather than with
B. erythropus. So I conclude that this taxon is very
closely related to B. queletii, though it resembles B.
erythropus, and is best considered as a variety of the for-#Misc-exposition*]

[@mer, following ALESSIO (1985). Nevertheless, this author
based his criterion mainly on macroscopic characters. He
neither attached much importance to the taxonomic value of
its amyloid hyphae, nor did he mention the coincidence of
its Q coefficient with that of B. queletii. As we can see#Misc-exposition*]
[@122#Page-header*]

[@the characteristic macroscopic features of the taxon
studied are now correlated with two important microscopic
characters: viz. Q coefficient and amiloidity of stipe and
pileus tramal hyphae, which coincide with those of B.
queletii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand, var. zugazae Moreno & Bon has
values which differ considerably from those of B. queletii,
having a mean Q value of approximately 3. Moreover, it
shows an inamyloid context with Melzer’s reagent, a
character which definitely separates it from B. queletii.
These data could point to a close relationship with B.
erythropus from which it, however, greatly differs from a
macroscopical point of view (MORENO & BON, 1977). Therefore
B. zugazae maybe represents an independent species.
Nevertheless, as I have never studied fresh material of
this taxon I refrain from making the corresponding new
combination.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally, var. lateritius (Bresad. & Schulzer) Gilbert
and var. rubicundus Maire are variants which differ from
Boletus queletii only in the cap colouring, a character
which may be insufficient to warrant a varietal rank
(WATLING, 1970). According to this author, var. lateritius
differs in the more brick red cap and var. rubicundus in
the carmine cap. Since I do not know these taxa I cannot
give a reliable opinion.#Misc-exposition*]

further studies in this section are necessary which should

[@Since 1983, the first author has been studying the lichen flora of
Portugal which resulted in a paper about lichens of northern and
central Portugal (v.d.Boom et al. 1990). In 1993 he made many
collections in the southern province Algarve. One epiphytic collec-
tion of Caloplaca, resembling C. obscurella, proved to be an undes-
cribed species. One year after its discovery the second author col-
lected material of the same Caloplaca species in southern Spain
(prov. Cádiz). Information on the ecology of the new species is
mainly based on field observations made by the first author at the

evergreen trees in southwestern Europe (Olea europaea, Ceratonia
siliqua & Quercus suber). It seems to be a maritime species because
all collecting sites are close to the sea (fig. 3). On the type locality it
was found on two phorophytes, Ceratonia siliqua and Olea euro-
paea, in a weakly sloping orchard with many scattered, very small
to large limestone outcrops. This limestone was covered with a.o.
Caloplaca and Collema species in sunny situation and with Lepraria
spp. and Squamarina spp. on shaded surfaces. The terricolous lichen
flora included Catapyrenium semaforonense, growing with Psora
decipiens. Both phorophytes of Caloplaca fuscoblastidiata were
mature trees which were found together with deciduous Prunus
dulcis trees. On the latter trees C. fuscoblastidiata has not been
found. Associated species on C. siliqua include Bacidia laurocerasi,
Buellia griseovirens (fertile), Caloplaca lucifuga, C. pollinii, Leca-
nora piniperda (the latter on decorticated wood of trunk), Pannaria
olivacea, Peridothelia cf. fuliguncta, Pertusaria hemisphaerica and
Schismatomma decolorans. On Olea europaea, C. fuscoblastidiata
was growing together with Caloplaca obscurella, Collema multipar-
titum, C. nigrescens, Koerbera biformis, Rinodina dalmatica and
Tephromela atra. Accompanying species on shaded trunks of O.
europaea in Spain are Physconia distorta, Physcia tenella and
Leptogium teretiusculum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTE#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. fuscoblastidiata may be confused with C. herbidella, when
sterile, but the thallus of the former is always darker and, if well
developed, distinctly blastidiate. C. herbidella has never been found
with a blastidiate thallus. The apothecia of C. fuscoblastidiata
resemble those of C. obscurella, but are more prominent and con-
spicuous and more abundant. Moreover, the latter species always
has well-developed, minute, rounded, crater-shaped soralia. The new
lichen is easily distinguished by the combination of blastidia and#Misc-exposition*]

his material as Caloplaca sp., C. sarcopisoides or C. refellens, now
considered as synonym of C. obscurella (Arvidson & Martinsson
1993). He did not publish his records of the C. obscurella group but
hc distributed an exsiccate: Lich. Lus. Sel. Exs. 244 as "C. sarcopi-

this species. Probably it belongs to C. fuscoblastidiata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Queen Charlotte Islands lie off the west coast of North
America, and are characterized by a strongly oceanic climate, coniferous
rain forest and rocky shores, with a low mountainous region rising to
1100 m.s.m. Its lichen flora is abundant and diverse, with numerous
disjunctions and new taxa. Fifty-four crustose lichens and lichenicolous
fungi are reported as new for British Columbia, among which six are
new to Canada, and 18 are new to the North American flora. The new
combination Porpidia ochrolemma (Vain.) Brodo & R. Sant. is made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@A series of historical factors have made the Queen Charlotte Islands
(or the "Charlottes," as I will often call them in these pages) a special place
for biologists and geologists. The unusually high number of endemic and
disjunctive plants and animals found there (see articles in Scudder and Gessler
1989) have given the islands the nickname, "The Canadian Galapagos" (Foster
1984). Because of endemisms and disjunctions already known there, the
islands were made the object of an intensive study of the vascular plant flora
in the 50's and 60's resulting in the Department of Agriculture's two-part
publication entitled, "Flora of the Queen Charlotte Islands" (Calder & Taylor#Misc-exposition*]
[@136#Page-header*]

[@1968; Taylor & Mulligan 1968). At about the same time, Dr. Wilfred
Schofield, at the University of British Columbia, was working on a bryophyte
flora of the Charlottes, to complement the work by Calder and Taylor. In
1966, Dr. Schofield suggested that I take up the study of the lichen flora so
as to "round out" the floristic treatment. This, I gladly agreed to do and
immediately made plans for my first field season on the islands. The work
proved to be vastly more complicated than anyone could have guessed, and
other projects prevented either Schofield or Brodo from completing the
project as envisioned, i.e., "Part 3" of the Flora of the Queen Charlotte
Islands. Schofield has published a number of papers dealing with the Queen
Charlotte bryophytes (Schofield 1989, and references therein), but this is the
first paper of a series based on my own work entirely devoted to the lichens
of the Queen Charlotte Islands (QCI).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of the increased interest in the QCI and nearby Vancouver
Island from the standpoint of conservation of shoreline habitats, preservation
of virgin timberland and major centers of endemism (Islands Protection
Society 1984; Goward 1994), the publication of the flora has taken on a
degree of urgency. In addition, much activity is now occurring in southeast
Alaska, especially in the Tongass National Forest, concerned with establishing
baseline studies of lichens for monitoring air quality. No comprehensive
treatment of the lichens of the northwest coast now exists, especially one
dealing with the crustose lichens, and so there is no way for botanists,
naturalists and other workers to identify the lichens they encounter in their
work. Fortunately, Goward et al. (1994) have prepared identification keys and
notes on all the foliose and squamulose lichens of British Columbia, and a
similar work is being prepared for the fruticose species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this paper, and in the revisions to follow, references will be made
to lichens in nearby coastal areas, especially Southeast Alaska' and Vancouver
Island. For this reason, the historical treatment below will also cover those
areas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Accounts of the climate, general topography and flora of the QCI
have been published by various authors in a variety of forms (e.g., Calder &
Taylor 1968, Scudder & Gessler 1989, Islands Protection Society 1984). A
summary is given below, however, to acquaint the readers with the general
geographic setting.#Misc-exposition*]

[@GEOGRAPHY.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Queen Charlotte Islands comprise an archipelago of 138 islands
lying approximately 80 km off the British Columbia mainland coast. There
are two main islands, Graham to the north and Moresby to the south,
separated almost at the center by an east-west channel called Skidegate Inlet.
The triangular archipelago is ca. 275 km long and, at its widest point, ca. 95
km across (Fig. 1). There is a rugged mountain range (the Queen Charlotte
Mountains) running from the northwest corner of Graham Island to the tip of
Moresby and Kunghit Islands dividing the Charlottes into a hypermoist west
and relatively drier and flatter eastern region (the Queen Charlotte Lowlands).
The Skidegate Plateau on Graham Island is somewhat less rugged than the
Queen Charlotte Ranges, where the highest peaks (e.g., Mt. Stapleton and
Mount La Perousse on Graham Island, and Mt. Moresby and Mt. De La
Touche on Moresby Island) are over 1100 m. The spectacular San Cristoval
Range, forming the southern sector of the Queen Charlotte Range on southern
Moresby Island, is characterized by knife ridges, sheer rock walls up to a
hundred meters high, and isolated cirque valleys and lakes. It is in these
ranges that some of the most interesting endemic and disjunct taxa occur
(Brodo 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The coast line on the Pacific side is extremely rugged, with high,
rocky headlands and long fiords (though none as long as one encounters on#Misc-exposition*]
[@141#Page-header*]

[@the mainland). The coastal rocks, like the mountain tops, have an important
near-endemic and disjunct lichen flora (Brodo 1993). The eastern shores of
Graham Island and northern Moresby Island, by contrast, are relatively low,
with rounded hills and ridges never exceeding 150 m.s.m. From Louise Island
southward, the San Cristovals extend from east to west producing fiords on
both coasts. On Graham Island, the eastern and northern shores are mainly
sandy and low with infrequent inlets. The interior is dotted with large and
small boggy lakes, especially on Graham Island, with much exposed rock.
River mouths are gravelly and often have broad beaches or deltas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Southerland-Brown and Yorath (1989) present a detailed summary of
the geological events that shaped the QCI. The following brief description is
based mainly on that article. The parent materials on the Charlottes
originated, for the most part, from three periods of volcanic activity beginning
about 230 million years B.P., interspersed with relatively short periods of
sedimentary rock formation under marine conditions. The volcanic rocks
differ a great deal in chemistry, some being derived from deep in the mantle
and rich in metals, and others derived from a melting of the upper continental
crust, rich in alkalis and silica and poor in heavy metals. Through faulting
and subsequent erosion, a variety of rocks have become exposed, and others
have been overridden with more recent superficial deposits during the Tertiary
and Quaternary Epochs, especially in the northeast.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The extreme vulcanism of the area is the result of the Charlottes
lying on a fragment of the tectonic plate adjacent to the subduction zone
where the Pacific plate is thrust under the North American continental plate.
The Charlottes themselves, together with Vancouver Island and parts of
adjacent B.C. and northern Washington, were not formed where one finds
them today. Parts of the Alexander Archipelago making up the present-day
southern portions of southeast Alaska were also built on an independent and
remote crustal plate fragment. The two fragments (called "terranes") drifted
to the north and east over a period of more than 100 million years, first
colliding with each other about 140 million years B.P., and finally "docking"
with the North American continent at its present latitude about 100 million
years B.P. It is believed that the major rock formations forming all but the
northeast corner of the Charlottes came into being about the latitude of
present-day Peru (Southerland-Brown & Yorath 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@CLIMATE.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lying in the center of the Pacific rim area affected by moist, on-
shore winds, the Aleutian low pressure, and North Pacific high pressure
centers, and with a string of relatively high mountains running north-south, the
Queen Charlottes receive an abundance of rainfall throughout much of the#Misc-exposition*]
[@142#Page-header*]

[@year. These conditions have resulted in a true oceanic climate (mild, very wet
winters and cool wet summers), and the growth of one of the worlds most
magnificent temperate rain forests. The climate differs significantly on the
ocean and inland side of the Queen Charlotte Mountains. On the west coast,
the warm, moist air from the ocean is forced up by the mountains where it
cools and releases its moisture in the form of rain (ca. 3000-4000 mm/year).
In the recent Ecoclimatic classification of Canada (Ecoregions Working Group
1989), the western sector of the Charlottes falls into the "Oceanic South
Pacific Cordilleran" (SPo) region (Fig. 2). East of the mountain range, the air
is much drier and precipitation is less frequent, especially between May and
September, and rainfall is not much above the average for Canada (ca. 1000-
1500 mm/year). Reflecting these differences, the eastern sector of the islands
is classified as "Maritime South Pacific Cordilleran" (SPm) (Fig. 3).
Temperatures, by contrast, are quite similar on all parts of the islands at the
same altitude. During the winter, frosts are common, even at sea level, but
are never prolonged, and there is little snow except in the mountains, where
it can be extensive. (Much of the above information comes from Williams, in
Calder & Taylor 1968.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The list of lichens is based mainly on my own collections on the
Queen Charlotte Islands. I visited the Charlottes during the summers of 1967,
1968, 1971 and 1988, collecting over 5000 lichen specimens representing all
groups. In 1967, I was assisted by Mike Shchepanek, and in 1971 by Pak
Yau Wong. In 1988, | was accompanied by photographers Stephen and
Sylvia Sharnoff, and by entomologist (and wife), Fenja Brodo. I also
participated in the 1980 excursion to the QCI as part of the International
Congress of Systematic Biology meetings and collected additional material.
Travel on the islands was by chartered boat (circumnavigating the archipelago
several times over three seasons), by truck over paved public roads and
unpaved logging roads, especially on Graham Island, by fixed wing aircraft
to the larger bodies of water, and, in 1988, by helicopter to some of the
higher mountainous localities in Moresby Island, as well as some coastal
localities missed in earlier expeditions. I made major collections at 131
localities on 15 islands of the archipelago (Fig. 4). The first set of my
lichens are at CANL. Duplicates have been distributed to many herbaria,
especially as part of Lichenes Canadenses Exsiccati (Brodo 1971, 1977, 1984;
Brodo & Wong 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@There has been recent interest in documenting the rare or endangered
lichens of British Columbia (e.g., Goward 1993). In this context, most if not
all of the new records for North America listed here fall into the broad
(unclassified) category of "rare." The new records for B.C. generally
represent species that are rare in the province. It is interesting, therefore, that
some lichens found on the Queen Charlotte Islands in abundance are quite rare
elsewhere. Some examples include Coccotrema maritima, Caloplaca
litoricola, "Lecidea" phaeops and Amygdalaria subdissentiens. Some of these
species are good candidates for possible in situ survivors of the Pleistocene#Misc-exposition*]

but studies of the Queen Charlotte lichen flora are continuing, and changes

A number of new species will be described in future papers, and these, of

[@This inconspicuous lichen has apothecia under 0.2 mm in diameter. It has
received much attention in the literature under a variety of names (see
synonymy above; Poelt and Döbbeler 1979; Coppins 1983, 1989). The
identity of Bryostigma leucodontis with Arthonia muscigena was pointed out
by Santesson (1993). The Th. Fries type, which I saw in UPS, is virtually
identical, but is on moss, the preferred substrate of the species. On bark, the
apothecia tend to be flatter and slighter broader than on moss (0.15-0.2 vs.
0.1-0.15 mm), something pointed out by Coppins (1983). The description
given by Poelt and Dóbbeler (1979, sub Bryostigma leucodontis) agrees well
with the QCI material except that I could not find halonate spores even in ink
preparations. The descriptions in Coppins (1983, 1989) are even closer with#Misc-exposition*]

conifer (Tsuga).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In most keys (e.g., Clauzade & Roux 1986), A. muscigena would key out
to A. exilis (Flórke) Anzi or A. tenellula Nyl. Both these species have larger
spores and broader ascomata and, in fact, the distinctions between them are
small. The extent of thallus production (virtually absent in A. tenellula) seems
to be substrate induced. The hypothecial color, said to be colorless by
Clauzade & Roux (1986) is a difficult character to evaluate. In this and other
small Arthonia species, the ascomatal tissue that surrounds the asci is
generally similar in color and reaction with KOH on both sides of the
"hymenium." In this case, the tissue is brown, changing to olive in KOH.
Whether this layer is interpreted as a thin brown "exciple" having a hyaline
"hypothecium," or a brown "hypothecium" is obviously open for debate and
is the basis for conflicting statements in the literature. In his descriptions,
Coppins (1983) makes this point very clearly.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One difference perhaps worth noting between the QCI material and
European specimens I have seen is that the photobiont in the former has many

Lichenicolous fungi are very poorly known in North America, and it is
not surprising to note numerous new records from this group. D. parasitica
differs from D. parellaria (see below) in having predominantly 3-septate
spores, whereas in the latter, they are very variable, often with l-septate
spores predominating (Alstrup and Hawksworth 1990). The ascomatal tissues
are mostly dark brown or red-brown in D. parasitica rather than greyish or
yellowish brown (Triebel 1989, Alstrup and Hawksworth 1990), but to judge
from Queen Charlotte specimens verified by Hawksworth (Brodo 11467A, see

unreliable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Graphis insidiosa belongs to a small group of mostly Asian, tropical or

the locules are often separated from one another. It was described from New
Zealand and is also known from the Azores (Arvidsson 1990), southeastern
U.S. and the West Indies (Wirth & Hale 1978). The Charlotte material has
IKI+ light violet ascospores, differing in this respect from description in Wirth
& Hale (1978). The closely related G. triticea Nyl. is also supposed to have
IKI- spores, but specimens from New Zealand (e.g., Tibell 13301, 13500,
UPS!), agreeing in all other respects with the description, have spores that are
IKI+ light violet. Graphis triticea, also unreported for northern North
America, differs from G. insidiosa mainly in containing stictic acid (Wirth &
Hale 1978). Galloway (1985) says that G. insidiosa has a black prothallus,
which is lacking in our material. I believe that the limits between G.
insidiosa and G. tritacea need reexamination, and the possibility of
chemotypes should be considered. For the moment, however, the Charlotte
material can be included in a broad concept of G. insidiosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Pilophorus is characterized by its solid pseudopodetia upon
which the spherical or elongate apothecia develop. On this species, however,
the apothecia develop directly on the cephalodiate, primary, crustaceous
thallus, looking very much like a lecideoid crust (see synonymy above).
Although many species of Pilophorus can have sessile apothecia on occasion
(Jahns 1981), this is the only one to do so consistently. The Porpidia-like
ascus tip and narrowly ellipsoid, non-halonate spores, together with apothecial
anatomy and cephalodial production establish its identity with Pilophorus,
something first noted by Timdal (1988). Hertel and Rambold (1988) fully
discuss the anatomy, biology and classification of the species, and map its
world distribution. |The thallus and cephalodia of the Queen Charlotte
specimen, although different from those described in Hertel and Rambold
(1988) are within the range of variation of the species. The anatomy of the
apothecia is identical. As in "P. pallidus" (Timdal 1988), the thallus
contained isousnic acid. Its granular cephalodia had both G/oeocapsa and
Nostoc together, whereas Timdal (1988) noted that they were in different

[@ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@As this is the first of a series of papers that will report the results of my
Queen Charlotte Island studies, I will take the opportunity to thank the many
people who have made these studies possible. First and foremost, | must
thank Dr. Wilfred B. Schofield for introducing me to the Charlottes and
encouraging me to take up the study of the lichens. He also accompanied me
on several field trips there, leading me to the best localities. My field work
on the Charlottes began with Neil and Betty Carey taking me by boat to all
the coastal localities, always with a steady hand on the helm and lively
conversation along the way. The Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans
graciously provided boat transportation in 1967 down the east coast of
Moresby Island and a small boat for Skidegate Inlet. I was ably assisted in
my field work on the Charlottes by Michael Shchepanek (1967), Pak Yau
Wong (1971), and by Fenja Brodo, Sylvia Duran Sharnoff and Stephen#Misc-exposition*]
[@167#Page-header*]

[@Sharnoff (1988); and in southeast Alaska in 1988 by Rita O'Clair, Mary
Mueller, and Karla Hart. For verifications or identifications of many of the
lichens, I am much indebted to Sharon Gowan (Porpidia), Hannes Hertel
(Lecideaceous taxa), Aino Henssen (cyanophilic taxa) Stefan Ekman (Bacidia
and Byssoloma), C. Printzen (Biatora), Rolf Santesson (lichen parasites,
Verrucaria), and David Hawksworth (lichen parasites). | am particularly
indebted to Stefan Ekman for allowing me to include his unpublished
observations on Byssoloma marginatum. Finally, | must thank my colleagues
at the University of Helsinki and Uppsala University for making my sabbatical
year there so enjoyable and productive.#Misc-exposition*]

known only from Africa and are characterized by centrally stipitate,
shiny black basidiocarps and strongly dextrinoid hyphae. G.

the time being G, leucocreas is maintained as a distinct species. Both
species may be intermediate between Ganoderma and Amauroderma.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Keywords: Ganoderma, dextrinoid skeletal hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ganoderma hildebrandii was described by P. Hennings in a
paper written by Patouillard (1889:69). The type came from the
Comoro Islands, a string of small islands between Madagascar and
Mozambique. Later the species was illustrated by Bresadola (1932)
who repeated Hennings description and added that it was close to
Ganoderma laccato (Timm.) Pat. ( — G. lucidum (Curt.:Fr.) Karst.).
The species then went into oblivion and Furtado (1981:100) listed it
under "Taxa of uncertain affinity, excluded or insufficiently known".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Furtado (op. cit. ) stated that G. leucocreas Pat. & Har. could
be a synonym of G. hildebrandii Henn. and cited a collection by
Dybowski from Congo determined by Patouillard as G. leucocreas.#Misc-exposition*]
[@176#Page-header*]

[@However, this is not the type which came from Loango in Congo and
was collected in 1905 by an unknown collector.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type of G. leucocreas was examined by one of us (Ryvarden
1983) and although a certain similarity exists, there are some
differences which we think warrant keeping G, leucocreas as a
separate species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Steyaert, who studied the genus Ganoderma intensively during
his last years, never published on G, hildebrandii, but he left notes on
the species which kindly have been placed at our disposal by Dr. J.
Rammeloo at the Botanical Garden in Bruxelles. G, hildebrandii was
not mentioned by Corner (1983) in his survey of Ganoderma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During our examination of undetermined Ganoderma specimens, a
thin, slender specimen from Liberia attracted our attention by its
black, shiny stipe and white pore surface. The specimen was examined
and the name G. hildebrandii soon came into consideration because of
a unique combination of characters. A comparison with notes by the
late R. L. Steyaert, based on the type of G. hildebrandii indicated
without doubt that the Liberia collection was a specimen of G.
hildebrandii. In addition, Steyaert's notes suggested that he was
considering a € synonymy between G. hildebrandii,
G.nigrolucidum and G. leucocreas. The types of the latter two species
were examined by one of us (L.R.) in connection with studies on the
types of Lloyd (Ryvarden 1990) and of Patouillard (Ryvarden 1983),
respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since G. hildebrandii has conspicuous basidiocarps that are
easy to recognize macroscopically, we decided that it would be
appropriate to provide a modern description and to compare it with G,
leucocreas and with G. nigrolucidum. The latter name was found to be
a synonym of G. hildebrandii.#Misc-exposition*]

dominate. Microscopically the strongly dextrinoid skeletal hyphae#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thus, for the time being we consider the two species to be distinct.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In his survey of the Ganodermataceae Corner (1983:26)
reported a dextrinoid reaction of the skeletal hyphae of a single
Ganoderma specimen collected in Malaya, which he tentatively
identified as G. amazonense Weir. Corner's collection is certainly
unrelated to G. hildebrandii and, as he stated, the reaction is merely
specific or varietal rather than generic or subgeneric. However, he also
reported (op.cit.) a dextrinoid reaction in 10 Amauroderma species.
Interestingly, although G. hildebrandii is easily distinguished from
these species by its ganodermatoid basidiospores and its shiny
basidiocarp, it has in common with dextrinoid Amauroderma species, a
thin light coloured context where brown colours are more or less
absent, a dimitic hyphal structure, a central or nearly central stipe and
a terrestrial habit. This habit is common in Amauroderma while
Ganoderma species generally are found on wood. In addition,
Patouillard (1889:69) and Bresadola (1932:1009) both noted
similarities between G. hildebrandii and Amauroderma. The distinction
between the two genera is based solely on the shape of the
basidiospores and may not be natural (Furtado 1965, 198, Corner
1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@G. hildebrandii and G. leucocreas should be added to Corner's
list (1983:35-36) of species intermediate between the two genera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In conclusion, further cultural and molecular studies may eventually
clarify the interrelationship between G. hildebrandii and G. leucocreas.
DNA studies may also help to resolve the phylogenetic position of G.
hildebrandii in Ganodermataceae#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Tomentella has been monographed by Larsen (1974)
and the knowledge of the genus, especially in North America is
fairly good. Thus, it came as a surprise when one of us (L.R.) in
Costa Rica found a striking black odontoid species with large brown
spiny spores, far outside the range of size normally encountered in
the genus. An examination in the laboratory confirmed the
preliminary generic determination as the hyphae and the immature
basidia reacted with a strong green colour in KOH, a rather typical
character in Tomentella, see for example Larsen (1974:60) and
Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1988. No species described in Larsen (1974)
could match the large spores and the odontioid black basidiocarp
seen in the Costa Rican collection, and it is herewith described as

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The very large spores and the black basidiocarp make this a
characteristic species. The largest spores we have seen described for
a Tomentella species, are those of T. ruttneri Litsch. and T.
bresadolae (Brinkm. in Bres.) Bourd. & Galz. which normally have
spores up to 12-14 µm in diam (including the aculei), thus smaller
than those reported here. Further, the spores of 7. gigaspora are
more densely echinulate than the spores of the two species
mentioned above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@U. Kóljalg of the University of Tartu, Estonia, who is studying
the genus Tomentella in Estonia, kindly examined a part of the
holotype and pointed out that the spores of 7. gigaspora are golden
brown in 5% KOH compared with dull brown for the two other
species. He also added that in general the hyphae of 7. bresadolae
and 7. ruttneri are up to 6 to 7 µm wide and pale brown, while
those of 7. gigaspora are narrow, i.e. 3-4 µm in diameter and
almost hyaline.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stecchericium was described by D. A. Reid (1963) based on
Steccherinum fistulatum as type species. The genus is characterized
by basidiocarps with a hydnoid hymenophore, a dimitic hyphal
system with clamped generative hyphae and skeletal hyphae,
variable types of cystidia in the hymenium and amyloid warted
spores. Reid pointed out the obvious relationships to other genera of
the Hericiaceae Donk where most species have hydnoid basidiocarps
and amyloid warted spores and with a variable occurrence of
gloeocystidia in the hymenium. In macromorphology Stecchericium
comes close to Steccherinum S. F. Gray which however, has smooth
non-amyloid spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Later Maas Geesteranus (1966 and 1971) treated
Stecchericium in detail and showed that the Stecchericium seriatum
(Lloyd) Maas Gest. is the correct name for the type species. He also
described (1971) Stecchericium rusticum Maas Geest. from
Singapore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comer (1989) discussed the taxonomic relationship between
Stecchericium and related genera in Hericiaceae such as
Wrightoporia (poroid with dextrinoid skeletal hyphae in most
species) and Amylonotus Ryv. (amyloid with brown basidiocarps)
and concluded that they both should be merged with Stecchericium.
Comer (op. cit) also supplied a key to all species then known in
the genus including his recent transfers from the genera mentioned
above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wrightoporia is undoubtedly closely related to Stecchericium
but we feel that the poroid hymenophore and the dextrinoid skeletal
hyphae are convenient characters to keep the two genera separate
for the time being. Modem DNA technique now makes it possible
to elucidate generic relationship in a completely different way and
further investigations in the Hericiaceae with this technique may
settle the question on what is a true relationship and what are cases
of biological convergence. We still are completely at a loss about
which character are the primitive ones and which are the advanced
ones. Thus, we feel that Corner's approach is a bit premature under
the prevalent circumstances.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A parallel to the situation of what is discussed above is the
case of Junghuhnia (poroid) and Steccherinum (hydnoid). Everyone
familiar with the two genera accept the very close relationship
between them. Never the less, they are kept separately because of
the arguments mentioned above, and also partly of convenience and
to avoid too many nomenclaturial transfers which are needed should
the two genera be merged.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some years ago one of us (TH) collected an unknown
cinnamon pileate hydnoid species in Okinawa. Microscopical
examination showed it to be a typical Stecchericium with typical
skeletal hyphae and small ornamented amyloid spores, but also with
numerous large acanthophyses penetrating the hymenium from the
trama. Corners key gave no clue to its identity and it is described
below as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

the fact that on the top of a few sori aborted flowers could be seen. The given,
extremely thick spore wall measurements (3—5 µm) represent the distance from
the spore edge to the large, globose content (nucleus?); the spore wall is much

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Similar to the Ustilaginales of so many other host genera, the smut fungi of
Schoenus (fam. Cyperaceae, subfam. Cyperoideae, tribus Rhynchosporeae) are
unsatisfactorily known. According to Moore & Edgar (1970:191), there are about
100 species of Schoenus or, according to Engler's book (1964:604), ca. 85 species,
occuring mostly in Australia, New Zealand and New Guinea. The sole
cosmopolitan species is S. nigricans L., whereas S. ferrugineus L. occurs only in
Europe. On these 100 species of Schoenus only four smut fungi were reported.
Altogether 8 host species and a hybrid were found infected.#Misc-exposition*]

in spore balls, McAlpine (1910) transferred it into the genus Sorosporium.
Cunningham (1928) reported the next smut, Cintractia schoenus, on Sehoenus
pauciflorus, from New Zealand. Showing the characters of an Anthracoidea, the
name of this fungus was transferred by Vänky (1979) into this genus. Gäumann
(1932) described Tolyposporium kochianum on Schoenus nigricans x ferrugineu:
from Switzerland, the sole known smut on this host genus in Europe one:
Vänky, 1994). Finally, Kukkonen (in Roivainen, 1977) described Cintractia andina
on Schoenus andinus, from South America (Tierra del Fuego).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The authors of this paper collected several smutted Schoenus in New Zealand
and Australia. On these, two further undescribed smut fungi were found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@For microscopical studies dried specimens were used. If possible type specimens
were studied (marked with "!"). Light microscope (LM) with an oil immersion
lens, at a magnification of 1100 x was used for studies of spore morphology and
measurements. For this purpose dried spores were rehydrated in lactophenol by
gentle heating to the boiling point. Black spore balls were bleached in
concentrated hydrogen peroxide (H,0: ) for 5-60 minutes, permitting
examination of the spore balls structure, the shape of the spores and counting of
the spores in the balls. Because the treatment of the spores with hydrogen
peroxide swells up the walls, no measurements were done on such bleached
spores. Germinated spores, as well as spore ball formations, were studied in
lactophenol with cotton blue (lactic blue). For studies of the sorus structure and
spore ball formations, 0.5 µm thick sections of young sori embedded in plastic
were prepared by the standard technique for TEM preparations, and stained with
fuchsin — christal violet. For scanning electronmicroscopical (SEM) studies, dried
spores were dusted on small pieces of double-sided adhesive tape and
sputter-coated with gold-palladium, ca. 20 nm. Germination experiments were
carried out in Petri-dishes, on water-agar, at room temperature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Transversal section of a sorus (Fig. 18) shows host tissues completely surrounded
by mycelia in which the spore balls are differenciating and maturing
centrifugally. Inter- and intracellular hyphae are present in the host tissues. The
epidermis of the host plant is interrupted in some places where the sporogenous
part of the fungus on the surface of the host plant is connected with the
parasitic part of the fungus from the host tissues. Close to the external surface
of the host epidermis, sporogenous hyphae are concentrating in small groups. In
the middle of these groups, very young spore initials appear as fungal cells with
increased diameter. In the course of time, the spore initials become larger but
are still more or less isodiametrical, and the young spore balls are surrounded by
a thick layer of undifferentiated mycelia. By maturation, the young spores
become elongated, laterally flattened, reach the size and the form of the mature
spores, become pigmented and the balls are pushed toward the periphery of the
sori. The spore walls at the surface of the balls become thick and ornamented,
and the undifferentiated layer around the balls becomes thin. The remnants of
this layer on the surface of the spore balls may hide the ornamentation of the
spores and the limit between them when seen in SEM.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Summary#Misc-exposition*]

[@A project to describe the taxa of Amanita present in West Virginia
and adjacent areas of the mid-Appalachians was undertaken. A des-
cription of the major forest types in the state is provided. Distrib-
ution data from previous collection lists, checklists, and the general
literature are supplemented by collections made by the authors and
others in recent years and by review of older herbarium material. The
result is an extensively annotated list including brief macroscopic des-
criptions, spore measurement data, and other information on collec-
tions examined. A key is provided to all taxa listed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper, which presents a working list of species in the genus Amanita Pers.
reported from or known to occur in West Virginia and adjacent areas of the mid-
Appalachians, was developed originally by Tulloss in the form of a checklist for the
aid of those attending the 1985 North American Mycological Association (NAMA)
foray in Canaan Valley State Park near Davis, West Virginia. For the most part his-
torical information was collected during development of a recent checklist of West
Virginia fungi under development by Stephenson et al. (1994). Results of the
authors' study of regional specimens are also included in brief.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While this flora of West Virginia Amanita species is certainly incomplete, we
believe that the information presented herein will provide some sense of the richness
of the Amanita taxa of the study region and will prove useful in identifying collec-#Misc-exposition*]
[@244#Page-header*]

[@tions of Amanita from the area of interest. This list contains 77 distinct taxa,
described or provisional, of which at least 26 are as yet apparently undescribed.
There are several cases of possible misapplication of epithets in our sources. In these
cases, we have retained the usage of the references in question while noting the
taxonomic and/or nomenclatural difficulties.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In particular, there are cases of questionable application of European names; for
example, C. Bas, Rijksherbarium, Leiden, the Netherlands, noted during the 1984
Northeast Mycological Foray that A. virosa Lamarck, in Europe, always has an
irregular pileus and a northern or montane distribution—unlike the entity to which the
name is applied in North America. D. T. Jenkins (1986) has noted that there are a
number of white Amanita species bearing some similarities to A. verna (Bull.:Fr.)
Lamarck and that the concepts of these taxa are not well separated. Tulloss has
examined a number of the relevant types in this group (unpub. data), and we believe
that our identifications are i and correct applications of the names (e.g., A.
magnivelaris). Whether the European A. verna actually occurs in the United States,
we do not know.#Misc-exposition*]



[@The number of named taxa in Amanita section Vaginatae is a very small fraction
of the number of entities existing in the North American Amanita flora that obviously
must be assigned to that section. Among the names certainly or probably wrongly
applied in the United States are A. caesarea (Scop.:Fr.) Pers., A. ceciliae (B. & Br.)
Bas, and A. nivalis Grev. Tulloss (unpub. data) also has reservations concerning the
North American application of A. fulva (Schaeff.:Fr.) Pers. Amanita vaginata
(Bull.:Fr.) Vitt. is a poorly understood entity despite the widespread use of that
name.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tulloss et al. (1992) demonstrated that Colombian and Central American collec-
tions referred to A. rubescens Pers. represented a quite distinct taxon—A. brun-
neolocularis Tulloss et al. It is probable that the eastern North American mushroom
commonly called A. rubescens will turn out to be different from the European species
also (Tulloss and Lindgren, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should be emphasized that a number of species of Amanita are known to be
deadly poisonous and that several of these are present in the mycoflora of West Vir-
ginia. While some species of Amanita are reportedly edible, it is wisest to avoid
eating mushrooms belonging to this genus. We strongly urge the reader not to expe-
riment with edibility in this genus. A detailed discussion of Amanita poisonings is
presented by Ammirati et al. (1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE STUDY AREA#Misc-exposition*]

[@The greater part of West Virginia, including all of the state west of the mountains,
is characterized by mixed hardwood forests in which a large number of different
species of trees are present with considerable variation as to exactly what species are
domi ata icular site. Wid d domi include beech (Fagus#Misc-exposition*]

[@P P#Misc-exposition*]
[@245#Page-header*]

[@grandifolia Ehrh.), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), basswood (Tilia
heterophylla Vent.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), buckeye (Aesculus
octandra Marsh.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white oak (Q. alba L.), hemlock
(Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr], and hickory (Carya spp.). These same species also
make up the forests that occur at lower elevations in the mountains of the central por-
tion of the state. However, northern hardwood forests—in which beech, red maple
(Acer rubrum L.), yellow birch (Betula lutea Michx. f. )» and black cherry (Prunus
serotina Ehrh.) are the ch istic di g lly occur at elevations above
762 m.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subalpine coniferous forests dominated by red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) occur
at the very highest elevations (usually above 1219 m, but sometimes as low as 975
m). Ata few localities, balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] is present as an associ-
ate of red spruce (Core, 1966; Stephenson and Adams, 1986). As a result of the
extensive logging and freq fires that d th hout the ins of West
Virginia between 1870 and 1920, the original subalpine coniferous forests were
almost completely eliminated. As a result, the present-day distribution of this forest
type is much more restricted than was the case in the past. Numerous high-elevation
areas are largely barren of trees and now support a dense growth of shrubs, particu-
larly blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) and other ericads. Wetland areas generally called
bogs or glades also occur at a number of places in the mountains of the state.
Although these wetlands typically support a mosaic of different plant communities,
their most distinctive feature is the relative dominance of mosses—Sphagnum spp. and
(to a lesser extent) Polytrichum spp. The largest and best-known example of such a
wetland is Cranberry Glades (elevation 1029 m) in Pocah County (Steph
1993).#Misc-exposition*]



[@The major species of trees comprising the forests of the portion of the state east of
the mountains (essentially the eastern panhandle) are various species of oak, with
chestnut oak (Q. prinus L.), black oak (Q. velutina Lam.), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea
Muenchh.), white oak, and red oak the usual dominants. Pines [including Virginia
pine (Pinus virginiana Miller) and pitch pine (P. rigida Miller)] are often important
associates of oak, especially on drier sites (Core, 1966).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Braun (1950) included most of West Virginia in the Mixed Mesophytic Forest
Region, but the eastern part of the state was considered as falling within the Oak-
Chestnut Forest Region. As delimited by Braun, the Mixed Mesophytic Forest
Region also encompasses eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, and eastern
Kentucky. The Oak-Chestnut Forest Region includes the western portion of Virginia,
central and eastern Pennsylvania, and northern New Jersey. For the most part, the
forests of these areas are compositionally rather similar to the forests found in
adjacent areas of West Virginia considered part of the same forest region (Stephenson
et al., 1993). For example, collections of Amanita cited from Giles and Craig
Counties in western Virginia are from oak-dominated forests containing the same
species of trees that characteristically make up the forests of eastern West Virginia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Average annual precipitation in West Virginia ranges from less than 65 cm to#Misc-exposition*]
[@246#Page-header*]

[@more than 170 cm and is generally well-distributed throughout the year with no pro-
nounced dry seasons.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS & METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomic portion of this paper contains brief descriptions of species reported
from the region of interest. The species are assignable to both subgenera and to all
six sections of the genus recognized by Corner and Bas (1962). Each section is intro-
duced by a short description of characters of the section and a list of those species (if
any) that, while not yet reported from West Virginia or immediately surrounding
areas, are known from localities suggesting a range encompassing West Virginia.
Taxa not encountered in our study, but reported from regions relatively close to the
borders of West Virginia, and unencountered taxa appearing in checklists of fungi
found in the state are presented in a separate list in reduced type after the species des-
criptions for each section of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Certain macrochemical tests are useful for the study of Amanita in the field and
laboratory. Amanita bisporigera and A. virosa sensu auct. amer. are both among the
white species that exhibit a strong yellow reaction when a drop of KOH solution is
placed on the pileus. The reaction is particularly strong if a 5-10% solution is used.
Many species of Amanita contain the enzyme tyrosinase, which will facilitate oxida-
tion of various phenolic compounds such as phenol, L-tyrosine, and paracresol; the
colors produced vary with the species and the reagent and range from ruby to orange-
brown to purple-brown. Syringaldazine dissolved in 95% ethanol (0.5% solution by
weight) will produce a beautiful lilac to purple reaction if the enzyme laccase is pre-
sent in sufficient concentration in a mushroom. While this is not commonly the case
in Amanita, one can see the reaction most strongly in some species of section
Amidella and the rooting part of the bulbs of some members of section Lepidella (Tul-

[@TAXONOMIC PART#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fruiting bodies belonging to taxa in Amanita may be organized by the typical
form of the tissue of the stipe, the bilateral trama of the lamellae, and the non-
glutinous nature of the universal veil. The degree to which the divergence of the
bilateral lamella trama is manifested varies greatly from species to species (Tulloss,
1993; 1994), but is consistent within a given taxon. The form and breadth of the
lamella trama as a whole, along with the structure and depth of the subhymenium, are
extremely valuable characters in Amanita taxonomy (Tulloss, 1993; 1994). Tulloss
(1993) provides an account of methods for the study and description of this important
tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The universal veil varies from pulverulent to membranous and saccate. The varia-
tion is correlated in part to the relative frequencies of filamentous, undifferentiated
hyphae and inflated cells in this tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The partial veil is absent or evanescent in a number of taxa in the genus. Even
when it is persistent and membranous, this some difficulty for
anatomical analysis because collapsed or collapsing inflated cells (the function of
which is to allow separation of the lamella edges from the partial veil) may be strewn
on the upper surface and confused with inflated cells that are part of the partial veil's
internal structure. Often a membranous partial veil will have radially arranged fas-
cicles of filamentous, undifferentiated hyphae as a significant component (Tulloss et
al., 1992; Tulloss, 1993; Tulloss, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]





[@The stipe tissue consists of longitudinally arranged, usually clavate, inflated cells
that are almost always terminal on branching, filamentous,undifferentiated hyphae.
Either the inflated cells, called acrophysalides, or the hyphae may be dominant.
Examples of the stipe context anatomy are provided by Bas (1969: figs. 19-24). The
context of the pileus is comprised of analogous elements; however, they are often
lacking in any obvious orientation with the exception of the region immediately below
the pileipellis. The pileipellis is always well-defined in the taxa known from the
region of study and is composed for the most part of interwoven, filamentous,
undifferentiated hyphae (which quite frequently have a distinct subradial orientation
and are often gelatinized at the surface). Between 15 and 20 taxa of Amanita in North
America lack a well-defined pileipellis (Tulloss, unpub. data). Vascular hyphae
(aseptate hyphae of irregular diameter with refractive contents that are often poorly
soluble in 3% KOH solution) may be present in all tissues and sometimes are found in
densely tangled knots (Tulloss, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

an annulus; but there are some species that always exhibit one. For example, A. jack-
sonii and A. spreta have persistent, membranous partial veils. Size and form of the
universal veil are other important characters. It may be friable and easily broken up
into warts as in the many undescribed entities collectively called “A. inaurata” or “A.
ceciliae” in North American literature, or it may be membranous and sheathing on the
stipe. In A. virginiana, the volva is scant and at times like a small piece of exploded
popcorn. Amanita spreta has a thimble-like volva. Amanita jacksonii has a large,
thick, egg-shaped, cottony-surfaced one. Size and form of the stipe’s central cylinder
are important to record as are pileus color and the ratio of the length of pileus stria-
tions to pileus radius. In some taxa there are colored fibrils or scales on an otherwise
pallid stipe; note should be made of these.#Misc-exposition*]

most of the world. The vast majority of entities in this section are undescribed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Not yet collected in the region, but to be expected: A. pachysperma Atk. has a
gray cap, annulate stipe, plentiful 2-spored basidia, a habit like that of A. virginiana

1993). In addition, there has been reported to us an entity for which we have no

[@This is a very common mushroom in the northeastern part of the United States. It
has an orangish tan to orangish brown pileus with a striate margin. There is rarely
any remnant of the universal veil left on the pileus. The stipe is white to pallid and
exannulate and has a membranous, whitish, rusty-stained volval sac at its base. The
rusty stains on the volval sac, the color of the pileus, and the spore size and shape are
considered to be diagnostic. A complete comparison of anatomy between the North
American material and European material has 1 not yet been made. However, Tulloss
(unpub. data) has found they differ in the anatomy of the lamella trama and in the size
of the spores. This species is found in many forest types; the WV collections
reviewed occurred in mixed forests containing pines, hemlock, and striped maple
(Acer pensylvanicum L.) and in forests dominated by yellow birch, hemlock, red oak,
and basswood. The species tolerates wet soil and may be found growing in very rot-
ten stumps. Bills et al. (1986) reported the species as occurring both in red spruce
and northern hardwood forests.#Description*]

Amanita arkansana Rosen has white lamellae, spores with Q = 1.22 - 1.30 (-1.33)

apparently recognized this entity as an occasional form of “caesarea”: "Sometimes
the pileus is . . . burnt sienna color with yellowish margin. It varies also in size.”
During his time in West Virginia, Beardslee’s notes (MICH) indicate that he distin-

but not always, accompanied by a nonstriate pileus margin and attenuate lamellulae.
The most obvious group of exceptions in North America is to be found in section
Amidella. Species in section Lepidella are often pallid to white or a pale shade of
gray or brown. A number of these species have strong odors. The margin of the cap
in these species is nonstriate and appendiculate. Some species in the section have
fully elongating stipes, although most have a bulb. If there is a volval limb on the
upper bulb, it may be membranous, but not thick or leathery. If the volva contains
the base of a fully elongating stipe, then the species should be sought in section
Amidella.#Description*]

widely misapplied. However, the species is relatively rare, with a known range extending from Florida
northwestward to Illinois and northeastward to Vermont. The relatively small spores, the clements of the
universal veil [see (Bas, 1969)), and the easily found clamp connections at the base of basidia aid in diag-

[@This section contains curious exceptions to the general rule that the presence of
amyloid spores in an Amanita is associated with a nonstriate pileus margin and
attenuate lamellulae. Many of the species in this section will develop a striate margin
if they do not already have one when expanding out of the volval sac. The margin of
the pileus is appendiculate at first, but this material may disappear rather quickly. In
the taxa described below, a membranous calyptra is usually not left on the pileus.
However, it is a characteristic of North American taxa in the section that they leave
fibrous or flocculent, browning remnants of the thin inner layer of the universal veil#Misc-exposition*]

eventually if wounded; and, under the proper environmental conditions, the fruiting
bodies will often exhibit a transient pink bruising reaction when the flesh is scratched

find 2 membranous annulus early in the expansion of A. peckiana, and other species
(for example, A. volvata) will exhibit a flocculent annular zone when freshly
expanded. Unlike other sections of the genus, most members of this section that have
been spot tested for laccase have exhibited a positive reaction in at least some part, if
not all, of the fruiting body (Tulloss, unpub. data). A monograph on the Canadian,

[@This mushroom has an umbrinous brown pileus on which the color is often clearly
in radial streaks. The stipe has a superior annulus and a subabrupt bulb that is
markedly cleft in several places around its perimeter. These longitudinal clefts give
the impression of a cloven hoof. The entire fruiting body will slowly stain or bruise
brownish after handling or cutting. This species is very distinctive because of its
bulb, pileus color, oxidation reaction, and small subglobose spores; however, it has a
history of mistaken identification. Until Atkins‘ recognized it as a distinct species,
it was called A. phalloides in North America. Illustrators went so far as to give it a
globose bulb with limbate volva in their watercolors—because it ought to have had
one! While a number of mycologists have reported it to be edible when cooked,
others warn of confusing it with Amanita rubescens or believe it to be poisonous. We
do not encourage culinary experimentation with amanitas. Found in diverse forest

to light brown pileus with occasional white, irregular warts or patches of the universal
veil that become grayish over time. Its bulbless stipe is white with pale rosy tints
especially near the apex and is decorated with a rather large, graying annulus and with
remnants of the graying, submembranous, universal veil in broken rings or patches or
as a shallow, coherent limb (but not a sac) on the lower portion (but not the very
base) of the stipe.#Description*]

[@PILEUS: 85 - 140 mm wide, light reddish brown [8D3, near Drab (10YR

planar with decurved margin, slightly viscid when moist; pileipellis peeling rather
easily up to two-thirds of distance from margin to center of disc (even in exsiccata);
context mostly white, reddish brown just below pileipellis, 10 - 11.5 mm thick at
stipe, thinning evenly to margin, not changing color when cut or bruised; margin
short striate (0.15R), nonappendiculate; universal veil absent or present as whitish to
pale gray warts, becoming darker gray with age, irregular, at times confluent over
disc.#Description*]

[@LAMELLAE: free to adnexed with decurrent line on apex of stipe, close, off-

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The only previously described Australian species that might be assignable to
ita section Vagi and ines an lus, limbate or saccate volva, and
spores of approximately the size and shape of those in the cited collections is A.
cinereo-annulosa Clel. {South Australia, Encounter Bay, 26.v.1932 J. B. Cleland
s.n. (lectotype, AD 3010 & 3011 [formerly ADW 9270])). The lectotype was desig-
nated by Reid (1980) without comment. Based on the descriptions of Cleland (1933;
1934) and Tulloss’ examination of the lectotype (unpub. data), A. cinereo-annulosa
has the following characters differentiating it from A. murinoflammeum:#Misc-exposition*]



[@* a Drab to paler than Drab pileus#Misc-exposition*]

[@* a Drab, superior annulus rather distant from the stipe apex#Misc-exposition*]

[@* a stipe inserted to about one-third its length in the substrate and (according to
the protologue) having a slightly bulbous base (which, if proven true by fur-
ther observation, could place the species in Amanita section Amanita)#Misc-exposition*]

[@* an ample, sheathing, limbate volva of uniform height somewhat suggestive of
that of A. pantherina (DC.:Fr.) Krombh.#Misc-exposition*]

[@* a universal veil that, in exsiccata of the lectotype, is gray only on the surface
of a very thin, very broad patch over the disc of one specimen#Misc-exposition*]

[@* a universal veil containing no thick-walled elements and having scattered, nar-
rowly clavate cells as its only inflated elements#Misc-exposition*]

[@* spores [114/6/1] (9.3-) 9.8 - 14.7 (-20.3) x (5.6-) 6.4 - 8.6 (-10.2) µm, (L =
11.2 - 12.3 (-13.7) µm; L' — 12.2 µm; W = 7.1 - 7.6 µm; W’ = 7.4 µm; Q
= (1.33-) 1.40 - 1.99 (-2.23); Q = 1.58 - 1.66 (-1.83); Q" — 1.66).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The literature was examined with regard to non-Australian species with spore size
and shape similar to those of A. murinoflammeum; an annulate stipe; and a sub-
membranous or membranous, graying universal veil. While Tulloss has collected
material in the U.S.A. that falls into this category, apparently no such taxon has been
published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to having a partial veil, A. murinoflammeum is somewhat unusual in
that many of the taxa in Amanita section Vaginatae that have a graying, collapsing
universal veil have a stipe central cylinder with a diameter that is large relative to the
width of the stipe (ratio of 0.45 to 0.55 or more)—resulting in a rather fragile stipe.
In A. murinoflammeum, the ratio of the diameter of the stipe central cylinder to the
stipe width ranges from 0.25 to 0.35.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A SYNOPSIS OF THE LECANORA SUBCARNEA
GROUP#Misc-exposition*]

[@A. DICKHAUSER, H.T. LUMBSCH and G.B. FEIGE#Misc-exposition*]

[@Botanisches Institut, Universität Essen, D-45117 Essen, Germany#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abstract: The saxicolous Lecanora species related to L.
subcarnea are revised. Descriptions of the species and a key
to the taxa are included. Five species (L. farinacea, L.
ochroidea, L. rhodi, L. sanctae-helenae and L. subcarnea
with two chemotypes) and one variety (L. subcarnea var.
soralifera) are accepted. L. albidorufa, L. blanda, L. clau-
destina, L. dasycarpa, L. dirinaeformis, L. flexuosa, L.
pruinata, L. rubrocincta, L. subglaucodea and L. subpallida
and Lecidea myoplaca are reduced to synonymy with L.
farinacea, L. trevisanii and Lichen flexuosus with L. subcar-
nea. Neotypes for L. ochroidea and L. subcarnea are
selected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Lecanora subcarnea group is well known to lichenologists and distributed
world-wide. Lecanora subcarnea itself is a rather common lichen in Europe.
Despite this fact, the taxonomy and nomenclature of the group is not well
known. The difficulty in defining species in this group has been recognized by
Th. Fries (1871) and, more recently, by Nimis & Poelt (1987). The L. subcar-
nea group is defined here as comprising taxa which have heavily pruinose
apothecial discs which do not contain chromones. All species occur on siliceous
rocks. They may have an indistinct amphithecial cortex, but in most species a
cortex is lacking.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The members of the group are closely related to the Lecanora "pallida"
(=albella) group, which has been studied by Imshaug & Brodo (1966), but the
taxa of the pallida group occur mainly on bark. The two groups are considered
as separate in this paper for practical reasons only. They form a natural group,#Misc-exposition*]
[@304#Page-header*]

[@which is closely related to the Lecanora rupicola group, recently monographed
for Europe by Leuckert & Poelt (1989). The L. rupicola group mainly differs
in containing chromones in the epihymenium and the common occurrence of
chloroxanthones. A further group of species with heavily pruinose discs
includes L. carpinea (also treated by Imshaug & Brodo 1966) and related
species. These species have a distinct amphithecial cortex and contain chro-
mones in the epihymenium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a part of a continuing investigation of the Australian species of Lecanora
Ach., the saxicolous species with pruinose, apothecial discs lacking chromones,
were examined. It soon became clear that an examination of species described
from other continents was necessary to clarify the nomenclature and syste-
matics of that group. Therefore type material of all species belonging to this
group were studied as well as additional material when this was available.
Since the circumscription of taxa in this group were rather poorly defined and
several nomenclatural problems were involved, we decided to include our
results on the non-Australian species as well in this synopsis. This treatment
cannot be regarded as a monograph of the taxa, but a preliminary attempt to
clarify the taxonomy and nomenclature of the species involved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material and Methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material. Specimens were studied from the following herbaria: BM, BRI, CANL,
CBG, CHR, COLO, ESS, G, GZU, H, H-ACH, H-NYL, HO, M, O, OTA, PC,
PC-FÉE, PERTH, PRE, S, TUR, UPS, W, ZT and the private herbaria of André
Aptroot (Baarn), Klaus Kalb (Neumarkt/Opf.) and H. Thorsten Lumbsch (Essen).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods. Microscopy. Thalli and apothecia were cut using a freezing microtome in
16-20 µm thickness and stained with lactophenol cottonblue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chemistry. The chemical constituents were identified using thin layer chromato-
graphy, TLC (Culberson 1972, Culberson et al. 1981, Culberson & Johnson 1982)
and gradient-elution high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC (Feige et al.
1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thalli. All members of the Lecanora subcarnea group are crustose lichens,
which occur on siliceous rocks. The thalli vary from thick to thin, continuous
to rimose-areolate (as in some morphotypes of L. farinacea) or rimose- to
verrucose-areolate as is observed in most species. The areolae vary from plane
to bullate. The thalli are mostly greyish although the colour may vary from
whitish-grey to yellowish-grey, and sometimes greenish-grey or even rusty-
brown (in L. farinacea). Prothalli are either lacking or whitish. The only form#Description*]
[@305#Page-header*]

[@of vegetative propagules present in the group are soredia (in L. subcarnea var.
soralifera).#Description*]

[@Apothecia. Apothecia are found frequently in most specimens of the group. In
most taxa they are sessile, sometimes adnate (e.g. L. farinacea), but other
species may have fruiting bodies which are constricted at the base (e.g. L.
rhodi). The discs are plane to convex and always heavily pruinose. The colour
of the discs vary from carneous to pinkish, but can be also reddish-orange (e.g.
L. rhodi). When infected by lichenicolous fungi, the discs may become dark
brown in colour.#Description*]

[@The apothecial margins are concolorous with the thallus. In most species they
are prominent and persistent, but in L. rhodi the margins become excluded. In
several specimens heavily flexuose margins can be seen, while others have
entire to flexuose discs. In L. sanctae-helenae the margins remain rather thick
and entire and never become flexuose.#Description*]

[@Anatomy#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thalli. The internal morphology of the thallus is very uniform within the group
and is typical of that observed in Lecanora s.str. An epinecral layer covering
the thallus, an algal layer and the medulla can be distinguished.#Description*]

[@Apothecia. The apothecial margin is composed of the amphi- and parathecium.
The amphithecium contains trebouxioid algae and is rather thick (up to 270 µm
basally) and filled with small crystals, which rapidly or slowly dissolve in
KOH. These crystals are prominent under polarized light (POL+). An amphi-
thecial cortex is absent in most species, but an indistinct cortex is observed in
L. farinacea and L. sanctae-helenae. If present, the cortex is rather thin (25-35
µm) and interspersed with small crystals (POL --), which may or may not
dissolve in KOH. The parathecium always contains small crystals (POL+) and
is 15-20 µm thick.#Description*]

[@Under the microscope the epihymenium appears granular with small greyish to
brownish crystals (POL+). These crystals and their colouration disappear in
KOH. Both the hymenium and the hypothecium are hyaline. The paraphyses
are septate, sparsely branched and slightly thickened apically. The subhyme-
nium may be hyaline or yellowish. Clavate to clavate-cylindrical, eight-spored
asci occur in this group as is the typical of asci in Lecanora s.str. (cf. Hafellner
1984, Hertel & Rambold 1985). The ascospores are always hyaline, non-
septate and ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid.#Description*]

[@While the morphology and anatomy of the L. subcarnea group is not very
variable, chemistry plays an important role in the definition of taxa. Most
chemical segregates can also be distinguished by morphological and anatomical
characters, but these may be subtle or difficult to observe, if one is not familiar
with the taxa. Therefore chemical analysis is an ideal tool for the identification
of species in the L. subcarnea group.#Description*]

stances were detected in the group and both are characteristic of individual
species. The orcinol depside 2'-O-methylperlatolic acid occurs only in L. rhodi,
while L. sanctae-helenae is characterized by the presence of the dibenzofuran
placodiolic acid. The distribution of the major chemical substances observed in

[@310#Page-header*]

[@Remarks: Lecanora farinacea is characterized by the whitish grey thallus, the
presence of the norstictic acid chemosyndrome in addition to protocetraric acid
and the relatively large spores. Moreover, it can be distinguished from most
similar species by the presence of an amphithecial cortex where the cortical
crystals do not dissolve in KOH.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Variability: This species is notorously variable, which is not surprising for such
a widely distributed lichen. The number of synonyms listed above also reflects
the fact that the species is both very common and variable. Regarding the mor-
phology the thickness of the thallus can vary between rather thin to thick. The
thickness of the pruina can also vary; in some specimens the pruina is rather
thin (as in the types of L. albidorufa or L. dasycarpa, which are almost identi-
cal, although both taxa were described by Zahlbruckner in the same publi-
cation!), while others have very heavily pruinose discs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type of L. claudestina has a heavily verrucose thallus. This morphotype
has also been collected in New Zealand [Elix 7763 (CBG)] and seen by us in
Australia, where it is typical for rather shaded habitats. While the morphology
is rather variable, this species is quite uniform anatomically. Whereas atranorin
and chloroatranorin are always present in this species, the concentration of the
depsidones protocetraric and norstictic acids does vary. While both substances
are major compounds in most specimens, in some either norstictic or protoce-
traric acids become minor compounds, while in a few cases one or other of the
depsidones could not be detected. However, this morphological and chemical
variation is interpreted as intraspecific variation, since no correlation with other
characters or geography were found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taxonomy: Lecanora farinacea was listed as a synonym of L. caesiorubella (as
"L. cancriformis") by Zahlbruckner (1928). However, Imshaug & Brodo
(1966) demonstrated, that these species could be distinguished by their variation
in spore size and ecology, among other characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nomenclature of L. caesiorubella is somewhat puzzling. The first name
mentioned in the literature for this common, subtropical and tropical,
corticolous lichen was Verrucaria cancriformis Hoffmann (Hoffmann 1796).
Following Degelius (1954), Imshaug & Brodo (1966) interpreted the descrip-
tion of the name cancriformis as a variety, because it was only mentioned by
Hoffmann (1796: 171) in a note. However, this interpretation cannot be
accepted because Hoffmann himself stated in a " Vorbericht" in his book, that
taxa, which he did not accept, were mentioned in notes ["...auch Arten,
welche ich als solche aufzuführen noch unentschlofen war, findet man
entweder in Klammern () den Anmerkungen oder ohne Bezifferung der
nüchstverwandten Art beigestellt." (Hoffmann 1796)] Since the name#Misc-exposition*]
[@311#Page-header*]

[@cancriformis was not accepted in the original publication, it has to be
considered as not validly published by Hoffmann (1796) (Art. 34.1.). The
misinterpretation of the valid publication, however, has no influences on the
name to be used for the taxon. The correct name is Lecanora caesiorubella
Ach.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution: This species occurs on open to somewhat shaded
siliceous rocks. It has a wide distribution in the Southern Hemisphere, occur-

[@Nomenclature: The name Lichen ochroides was introduced by Acharius (1798)
as a nomen novum for Lichen lutescens Pers., non Hoffm. He mentioned that
he had not seen authentic material, but relied on the literature. The description
by Persoon (1794: 26-27) was rather brief, but is consistent with the current#Misc-exposition*]
[@314#Page-header*]

[@concept of Lecanora ochroidea. No material of Lichen lutescens was found in
the Persoon herbarium at Leiden and the type must be regarded as lost. There-
fore a neotype has been chosen. This species was originally described from
Germany ("..prope Ilfeld in subharcynia.."). Although material from Germany
is available, the specimens are rather poor, and indeed no mature spores were
seen in collections from Central Europe, so a well developed specimen from
Sardinia has been selected as neotype. When Acharius compiled the Methodus
(Acharius 1803) he received material of Lichen flexuosus Pers., which he
placed into synonymy with L. ochroidea. Such material is present in H-ACH
(No. 342). Claude Roux has studied this material in the Acharius herbarium in
1982 and selected one specimen of the eight pieces present under this number
as lectotype of Lecanora ochroidea (Vitikainen, in litt.). This procedure cannot
be followed here for the reasons mentioned above. The decision by Acharius to
place Lichen flexuosus into synonymy with L. ochroidea was a purely taxono-
mic one and does not influence the nomenclature of that species. We
reexamined the material purported to be the lectotype by Roux and agree that it
represents Lecanora subcarnea. Therefore Lichen flexuosus has to be placed
under synonymy with Lecanora subcarnea and not L. ochroidea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@319@Page-header*]

[@Major substances: atranorin and virensic acid; minor substance: chloroatran-
orin.#Description*]

[@Remarks: Chemically Lecanora subcarnea is characterized by the presence of
protocetraric or virensic acids, but the morphological distinctions are not so
clear cut. The apothecial margins become excluded, a feature which distin-
guishes this species from L. farincea. L. subcarnea can be distinguished from
the other two species of the group in Europe by the colour of the thallus and the
chemistry.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Variability: Morphologically L. subcarnea is rather uniform. Two chemical
races occur within this species. The common chemotype contains protocetraric
acid, while chemotype II with virensic acid is much rarer. At first we conside-
red both chemotypes might merit taxonomic recognition. However, chemotype
II occurs sporadically throughout the range of chemotype I and the two
depsidones are very closely related biosynthetically, differing only in the pre-
sence (or absence) of a hydroxy-group in the 9-position of the B-ring (Fig. 4).
This suggests that chemotype II is only a simple mutant of L. subcarnea which
lacks the ability to oxidize the methyl-group at position 9 and that chemotype II
itself is polyphyletic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nomenclature: The name Lichen subcarneus was first mentioned in Westring
(1791) who recorded Swartz as the author of this name. However, this report
cannot be interpreted as a valid description of the species, since it was not
accompanied by a diagnosis (Art. 32.1.) and was certainly not meant as a taxo-
nomic description, as the paper deals with the use of lichens for dyeing. The
first valid publication of the name Lichen subcarneus was made by Liljeblad
(1792), who did not refer to Westring or Swartz and therefore has to be con-
sidered as the only author of the name. As no material which could be used as
lectotype was found in UPS or in H-ACH (Vitikainen, in litt.), a neotype has
been chosen. The neotype comes from the same region as the original material
(Óstergótland) and represents a typical and well developed specimen of the
species.#Misc-exposition*]

hanging siliceous rocks in Europe and western North America. In Europe it is a
rather common lichen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This variety can be distinguished from Lecanora subcarnea s. str. by the
presence of soredia. The anatomy of the apothecia and the chemistry of the
sorediate morph of L. subcarnea are identical with the typical variety. The
taxonomic recognition of sorediate taxa within the genus Lecanora differs.
While a sorediate morph of L. epibryon was not recognized at any taxonomic
level by Brodo (1984), more recently other sorediate taxa in the L. subfusca
group were treated as species or subspecies by Brodo et al. (1994). Alterna-
tively the varietal rank was chosen by Leuckert & Poelt (1989) for sorediate
taxa in the L. rupicola group. As we have not studied the European material in
detail we prefer to maintain the sorediate morph of L. subcarnea at the variety
level, simply because it was originally described as such by Magnusson.
However, the sporadic occurrence of the sorediate morph throughout the range
of distribution of L. subcarnea s.str. suggests, that var. soralifera is not a
monophyletic entity.#Description*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultural features of seven polypores (Aphyllophorales, Basidiomycetes) that
decay standing and/or fallen trees of several Nothofagus species in southern
Argentina are described. The species are Fistulina hepatica Schaeff.: Fr., Grifola
sordulenta (Mont.) Sing., Macrohyporia dictyopora (Cke.) Johans. & Ryv.,
Phellinus andinopatagonicus (Wright & Desch.) Ryv., Phellinus livescens
(Speg.) Rajchenb., Polyporus gayanus Lev., and Postia pelliculosa (Berk.)
Rajchenb. Cultures of red, yellow and flesh-colored forms of F. hepatica that
grow on different Nothofagus species were similar, supporting the treatment of
each form as a single taxon. Macrohyporia dictyopora causes a brown rot of
wood with cultural characters similar to those of M. cocos (Schw.) Johans. &
Ryv., a fact that does not support the segregation of M. cocos in a different
genus, ie. Wolfiporia Ryv. & Gilb. P. andinopatagonicus is dimorphic in
culture conditions, presenting either a bleaching or a staining form. The
secondary mycelia of M. dictyopora and of P. andinopatagonicus are
multinucleate, while that of P. /ivescens is di-trikaryotic. Polyporus gayanus and
P. pelliculosa have a bifactorial mating system and have a normal nuclear pattern
of the mycelia. Monokaryotic x monokaryotic and dikaryotic x monokaryotic
compatibility tests performed between specimens of P. pelliculosa from
Argentina, Australia and New Zealand showed a high degree of compatibility.
Thus supporting the synonymy of Spongipellis chubutensis Wright & Desch., a
later name used in Argentina, under P. pelliculosa. Antrodia stratosa (Wright &
Desch.) Rajchenb. has a unifactorial mating system and heterocytic nuclear
behavior. The incorporation of A. stratosa in Amyloporiella David & Tortic is
discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The polypore flora of the Patagonian Andes in Argentina has been regularly
studied since the first survey made by Wright & Deschamps (1972). Several
works by Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1985) and Rajchenberg (1983, 1987, 1989,
1993, 1994a, 1994b, 1994c and 1995) have revised its composition and provided
data on the biology of several species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the study of wood-rots found in standing Nothofagus pumilio (Poepp.
& Endl.) Krasser (Cwielong & Rajchenberg, 1995), the main native forest
resource in Patagonia, we isolated and studied the cultures of several polypores,
of which we knew little or nothing of their cultural features, mating system
and/or nuclear behavior of their mycelia. We herein present the results of this
study. We also include information regarding two species that grow on other
Nothofagus species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures were isolated from fresh tissue of fruiibodies or from wood-rots. They were studied
and described according to Nobles (1965). The species codes describing 6 week-old cultures
follow the system of Nobles (1965) with the modifications summarized in Nakasone (1990).
The cultures were grown on malt extract agar in the dark at 25° C. The rate of growth was
expressed as the radial growth of the mat at the end of the study or as the number of wecks
required by the cultures to cover the agar in a 9 cm. Petri dish from an inoculum at the side.
Oxidase reactions and mat diameters were recorded at 1 week after inoculation in the dark at 25
°C. Gallic acid (GAA) and tannic acid (TAA) agar media were made according to Nobles
(1965) while tyrosine agar medium (TyA) was made according to Nakasone (1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nuclear behavior (Boidin, 1971) was examined according to the dyeing procedure
described by Boidin (1958). Mating tests and monokaryotic x monokaryotic and dikaryotic x
monokaryotic compatibility tests were performed according to Hallenberg (1984). After the
mycelia had been in contact for 6-8 weeks they were examined to determine the presence of
clamps connections. When there were no clamp connections the mycelia were left in contact for
longer periods and were examined regularly until the agar medium was dry. Mating types were
assigned arbitrarily.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures are kept at the authors’ laboratory as 'CIEFAP n"; some duplicates were also
incorporated in BAFC. MR refers to specimens (fruitbodies) collected and/or numbered by the
senior author and from which cultures were obtained. Specimens that were not numbered are
indicated as s.n. (sine numero = without number)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nuclear behavior: heterocytic. Spores are uninucleate. Monosporic cultures are
multinucleate, with more than 700 nuclei in the first hyphal segment. It was
impossible to find the first septum of the monosporic mycelium. Polysporic

[@Remarks: David & Tortic (1984) segregated from Antrodia the species with
heterocytic nuclear behavior into a genus of their own, i.e. Amyloporiella David
& Tortic. It included species with resupinate habit, chalky consistency, bitter
taste, and some species with hyphae with walls that dissolve in KOH solution
and that have an amyloid reaction in mass. Some species are perennial. Some of
the species were tetrapolar, (David & Tortic, 1984), contrasting with the
bipolarity and homothallism known from most other species of Anírodia. The
validity of this genus, based on those characters, seems uncertain, when we
consider that:#Misc-exposition*]

[@a) Antrodia oleracea (Davids. & Lomb.) Ryv. and A. alpina (Litsch.) Gilb. &
Ryv., which were also included in Amyloporiella, have a normal nuclear
behavior (David & Tortic, 1984).#Misc-exposition*]

[@b) A. oleracea has a unifactorial compatibility system, as shown by Lombard
(1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@c) A. stratosa, though presenting a heterocytic nuclear behavior, has a coriaceous
or a corky consistency, its hyphae do not swell in 5% KOH and are not amyloid,
and its mating system is unifactorial.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to these examples it seems to us that there exists variability
regarding the characters used to create the new genus. Therefore we do not
consider appropriate to support it (cfr. Renvall & Niemela, 1992). For a
nomenclatural treatment of Amyloporiella see Ryvarden (1991). The
morphological uniformity in fruitbodies of Antrodia species is supported by their#Misc-exposition*]
[@328#Page-header*]

[@cultural features, all the species presenting clamped, generative hyphae with
irregular thickened walls. On this respect it is interesting to note that species in
Fibroporia Parm. lack this type of hyphae in culture conditions as well as in the
fruitbodies. Also, the fruitbodies of this genus differ from those of Antrodia by
the few skeletal hyphae present either in the context or in the dissepiments. This,
together with the tetrapolarity presented by all the species so far included in
Fibroporia, supports its segregation from Antrodia.#Misc-exposition*]

Wright (1961), Wright & Deschamps (1972) and Rajchenberg & Wright (1987)
treated Spegazzini's new species as varieties of F. hepatica, but Singer (1969)
emphasized they were different taxa, though he did not present supporting data.
In our four years collecting in the Nothofagus forests (though north from the
Magellanic area) we found only F. hepatica growing on N. antarctica. We never
found Spegazzini's species in our trips. The fruitbodies of F. hepatica found on
N. antarctica were similar in shape, color and microscopic features to those
growing on N. dombeyi, and both are similar to fruitbodies found in the northern
hemisphere. The materials collected for this study grew on different substrates
and in spite of differences in context color, their microscopic features were
similar. Basidiosp did not germi on d medium (MEA) under lab
conditions. As a result, compatibility tests could not be performed and the
cultural features did not show differences between the forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures of Fistulina hepatica are readily identified through the slow growth
of the mat and the production of characteristic elongated chlamydospores. The
species is associated with a brown rot in the substrate. In N. pumilio, F. hepatica
never produces a well developed rot but instead develops a general reddish
coloration of the heartwood. This coloration dissappears upon drying the timber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: We verify that M. dictyopora produces and is associated with a brown
rot in the substrate, as already indicated by Buchanan & Hood (1992). Ryvarden
(1991) pointed out that the associated wood-rot of this species is white, but this is
certainly an error. The cultural features of M. dictyopora are similar to those of
Poria cocos Schw., a species that was also included in the genus Macrohyporia
(Johansen & Ryvarden, 1979; Ryvarden & Johansen, 1980). Poria cocos is
characterized in culture by: simple-septate generative hyphae, fiber hyphae,
wide, thick-walled generative hyphae and negative results of the oxidase
reactions (Nobles, 1958; Stalpers, 1978; Ginns & Lowe, 1983, sub Macrohyporia
extensa (Pk.) Ginns & Lowe). Ryvarden & Gilbertson (1984) created the genus
Wolfiporia to accomodate P. cocos and segregated it from Macrohyporia based
upon basidiospore shape: they are thin-walled and cylindric in P. cocos and
slightly thick-walled and globose-subglobose in M. dictyopora. Both species,
however are similar in other features of their fruitbodies: both are resupinate,
have a dimitic hyphal system with wide simple-septate generative hyphae and
branched skeletal hyphae (in P. cocos), or ligative hyphae (in M. dictyopora).
Given these similarities, plus their similar cultural features, and the association
with a brown rot, it seems that the new genus for P. cocos, based only on the
basidiospore features is unnecessary.#Misc-exposition*]

not become typical fiber hyphae. Hyphae with slightly thickened, yellowish walls
that develop yellowish or caramel-colored cytoplasmatic contents are also
formed (Fig. 4D). In cultures of the bleaching type, hyphae with much branched,
digitiform, short, lateral branches are formed, which develop yellowish or light to
dark chesnut brown, slightly thickened walls (Fig. 4E). These structures may be
inconspicuous or may develop extensively to form a plectenchyma.#Description*]

[@Remarks: Phellinus andinopatagonicus is the main white-rot species found on
standing N. pumilio (Cwielong & Rajchenberg, 1995). It produces a white pocket
rot in the roots and in the base of these trees, but in the stem a fibrous rot.
Aurantioporus albidus Rajchenb. & Cwielong (Rajchenberg, 1995) also causes a
white pocket rot in the heartwood of N. pumilio, N. antarctica and N. dombeyi,
but this pocket rot has a different, distinct aspect, because the pockets are
surrounded by dark chestnut coloured wood. Cultures of P. livescens (Speg.)
Rajchenb., the only other Hymenochaetaceae so far known to decay standing N.
pumilio, are easily distinguished from those of P. andinopatagonicus by their
much slower growth, their beige-yellowish, thick aerial mats and,
microscopically, by the formation of typical fiber hyphae (see below). Dimorphic
strains in species of Phellinus Quél. are well documented (Niemela, 1977; David
et al., 1982). Stenlid & Rayner (1989) have critically reviewed the ecological
meaning of culture dimorphism in Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. and other
Aphyllophorales. Although Deschamps & Wright (1975) presented a species
code describing the culture of P. andinopatagonicus, they did not give details of
its morphology and did not describe the dimorphism found in our study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Compatibility tests#Misc-exposition*]

[@Compatibility tests were performed between Argentinian, New Zealand and
Australian strains. Mono and polysporic cultures were used to perform two types
of tests (Hallenberg, 1984): a) Mono x mono mating tests and b) Poly x mono
mating tests (Buller phenomenon). Results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Mating
tests between monosporic cultures of ‘typical’ P. pelliculosa cultures and
‘atypical’ polysporic cultures obtained from wood-rots found in standing N.
pumilio in Argentina were also performed in order to verify their identity. Results
are shown in Table 3.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The positive results obtained in the mating tests between the monosporic
strains of Argentina and New Zealand (Table 1) and the high degree of
dikaryotization in the di x mono compatibility tests (Table 2) support the
conspecifity of the specimens of either side of the Pacific Ocean. Therefore,
Spongipellis chubutensis Wright & Deschamps (1972, 1975), described from the
Patagonian Andes of Argentina, is synonymous with Postia pelliculosa,
described from Tasmania (Australia) and also known from New Zealand
(Cunningham, 1965; Buchanan & Hood, 1992), as suggested by Hjortstam &
Ryvarden (1985). The compatibility test of 'typical' and ‘atypical’ strains of P.
pelliculosa also resulted in a high degree of dikaryotizacion (85%) indicating
conspecificity. Thus, the morphological variation shown by these strains must be
evaluated at the species level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks : Cultures of P. pelliculosa were roughly designated as 'typical'or
‘atypical’. ‘Typical’ cul! were ch ized by the bination of thick, felty
or woolly aerial mat, that in the tubes readily form a tuft of light chestnut
mycelium that grows over the slant, generative hyphae with homogeneously
thickened walls and hyphae with irregularly thickened walls, chlamydospores
and a weak positive TAA reaction. Cultures from Australia (CIEFAP 61 and 64)
differed in forming hyphae with lateral, short, thick-walled evaginations (Fig.
7G). Cultures from New Zealand (CIEFAP 71 and 76) lacked any type of hyphae
with thick walls. Many cultures isolated from rotted wood of standing N. pumilio
lacked the ‘typical’ features of this species and were designated as ‘atypical’.
Their mats were not as thick and few or no hyphae with wall thickenings were
formed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wright & Deschamps (1972) studied the cultural features of two strains of this
species. They considered the oxidase reactions as positive but we disagree. Our
strains were either negative or weakly positive on TAA. In addition all our
strains were associated with a brown rot. The oxidase reactions or lack of one is
important in determining the taxonomic disposition of this species. If a white-
rotter, the species could be classified in Spongipellis Pat. Whereas, the
combination of producing a brown rot and having a monomitic hyphal system
with clamped generative hyphae supports the disposition in Postia Fr.
(Rajchenberg, 1987). Postia pelliculosa is distinguished by the thick-walled
spores, the ochraceous context and the relatively rapid germination of the spores.
Typical species of Postia are characterized by white fruitbodies and thin walled
spores that take 3-4 weeks to germinate (David, 1980). Postia pelliculosa is the
main wood-rotting species of standing N. pumilio in Patagonia, causing about
50% of its decay (Cwielong & Rajchenberg, 1995). Our results, which include#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Herbarium Cryptogamae Indiae Orientalis houses more than
40,000 fungal collections. Of those, 595 collections are of
Meliolaceae belonging to 417 species and infra-specific taxa;
Amazonia - 18, Appendiculella - 3, Armatella - 8, Asteridiella
- 33, Diporotheca - 1, Irenopsis - 15, Meliola - 339 and
Prataprajella - 1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Key words: Meliolaceae; exsiccatae, herbarium#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Herbarium Cryptogamae Indiae Orientalis (HCIO) was
established by Sir Edwin John Butler in 1905 at Pusa, Bihar.
Because of the earthquake in 1934, this herbarium was shifted
to New Delhi. This is one of the biggest herbaria in eastern
Asia with more than 40,000 fungal exsiccatae belonging to 3550
genera including more than 4000 type materials.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An attempt has been made here to list the Meliolaceae
exsiccatae housed in HCIO. We have followed here Mueller & von
Arx (1971) in listing all the species of the Meliolaceae
genera: Amazonia, Appendiculella, Armatella, Asteridiella,
Diporotheca, Irenopsis, Meliola and the recently described
genus, Pratapajella. The synonyms provided herein are the
names written on the herbarium materials and the recent names
are based on the published data of Hansford (1961) and others.
A detailed revision of Indian Meliolales will be published in
due course.#Misc-exposition*]

Guinea is given. Twenty-one taxa are reported, including the five new species
and one new variety: Pertusaria anomalospora, Pertusaria buloloensis, Pertusaria

and Pertusaria plethocarpa. A key to the taxa is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Papua New Guinea is the eastern half of a large island to the north of Australia,
lying south of the Equator between latitudes 4°S and 10°S and rising to 4509 m at its
highest point, Mount Wilhelm, in the centre of the country. A detailed account of the
topography, geology, climate and vegetation of Papua New Guinea is given by Lambley
(Lambley 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The lichen genus Pertusaria in Papua New Guinea has received little attention.
Mattick (1942) gave a brief account of the history of lichenological exploration in New
Guinea but Pertusaria was not among his list of genera collected on the main island.
Szatala, in his account of the lichen flora of New Guinea (Szatala 1956) recorded only
one spccies, P. rechingeri Zahlbr. (Zahlbruckner 1911). Thirty years later the Catalogue
of the lichens of Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya (Streimann 1986) recorded only one
additional species, P. gyalectoides Vezda (Weber 1971). More recent accounts
(Streimann 1990, Aptroot & Sipman 1991) contain no mention of Pertusaria ; however
a Sipman, first reported from Malaysia, was listed by Sipman (Sipman
I ).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This account is based mainly on collections made by two of the authors (JAE and
HS) in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1989 and specimens collected by L.K. Wade in 1967, and
S.W. Kolema in 1984. The majority of the specimens are in ANUC or CANB with some
duplicates in B and LAE. Chemistry was determined by thin layer chromotography (Elix
& Ernst-Russell 1993) and liquid chromatography (Feige et al.1993). A key to the taxa is
given.#Misc-exposition*]

disciform, corticolous species with hypothamnolic acid and lichexanthone, and one-
spored asci (fide Vainio, /oc. cit.). Both of these taxa are distinguished from the
somewhat similar P. novaezelandiae Szatala (Szatala 1939) by the presence of
lichexanthone and their distribution; Pertusaria novaezelandiae has not been found north
of Brisbane (Australia), 27°30'S. The specimens of P. hypothamnolica from Papua New
Guinea included a single fertile specimen and this contained only hypothamnolic acid.
This specimen may be the disciform Pertusaria pulchretincta Zahlbr. (Zahlbruckner 1928)
from Java which was reported to react K+ violet, suggesting the presence of
hypothamnolic acid. However, the two syntypes were sterile (Zahlbruckner, loc. cit.)
and the specimens are not available from W for examination. Pertusaria pulchretincta may
be a later name for P. bengalensis Vainio from Thailand (Vainio 1907), a sterile species
containing hypothamnolic acid. Pertusaria hypothamnolica occurs in south-eastern
United States, Papua New Guinea and Australia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Twenty-five species of Scleroderma have been recognised. The revised key is based
mainly on spore characters determined at the light microscope level. Scleroderma
species are assigned to one of three sections based on whether the spores are spiny, sub-
reticulate or reticulate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Sclerodermatales are widespread and common, either as. saprotrophs in soil or on
rotting wood, or as ectomycorrhizal symbionts of several important orders of trees
(Hawksworth et al., 1983). The Sclerodermatales includes four well defined families:
Sch and Pisolith A fifth family may have
to be constructed ie the recently described hypogeous member of the genus Horakiella,
H.clelandii Castellano and Trappe (1992). Until new material in all stages of
development has been examined it cannot with conviction be placed in any of the families
above. It differs from Scleroderma species in its hypogeous growth habit and its large
(25-30 x 30-35 µm), irregularly shaped spores. The Astreaceae are distinguished by the
fact that the exoperidium splits at maturity to form an ‘earth star’, whilst in other families
the exoperidium does not split, or if it does it exposes the naked gleba (Miller and Miller,
1988). The Broomeiaceae (Zeller, 1948) differs from the Sclerodermataceae and
Pisolithaceae in that there are numerous spore sacs seated on a common stroma. The
Pisolith is sep d from the Sclerod by the fact that the gleba is divided
up into a large number of persistant, thick-walled peridioles. By far the largest of the
families is the Sclerodermataceae, and at least twenty-five species have been described.
The other families contain very few species e.g. the Pisolithaceae contains only two
(Watling et a/., 1994). Their basidiomes are frequently found within both established
forests and disturbed sites and in some cases these can be traced back to their
ectomycorrhizae, but in other cases their ectomycorrhizal status is unknown. Although#Misc-exposition*]




[@404#Page-header*]

[@the related Pisolithus arhizus (Pers.) Raus. is the most widely used fungus for inocula to
improve the establishment of forest tree seedlings (Ruehle, 1980; Marx et a/., 1979), and
is easily identified from basidiomes in the field, Scleroderma basidiomes are more difficult
to identify. Indeed a comprehensive key to the species is not available. Several
Scleroderma isolates are currently being used as ectomycorrhizal inoculum, especially in
tropical ecosystems (Marx ef a/.,1991) and these have frequently not be assigned to
particular species. During an investigation of the ectomycorrhizal associates of S.E.
Asian trees, we have collected many sclerodermataceous fungi, and found it necessary to
revise and consolidate the available literature into a revised key to world species. From
the material studied it was clear that spore morphology fell into three well defined types;
spiny, sub-reticulate or reticulate spores. Twenty-five species of Scleroderma have been
distinguished. The key has been constructed as a necessity to assist in a systematic survey
of the Sclerodermataceae in the Philippines, and has since been successfully used in the
field to identify various Scleroderma species in a variety of S.E.Asia collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS AND MATERIALS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dried herbarium material was studied using a Leitz Diaplan light microscope. Slides
were prepared by mounting a smear of spores in a drop of absolute alcohol and a drop of
10% ammonium hydroxide. Spore ornamentation was observed using an oil immersion
(x100) objective. Spore size was determined by measuring the diameters of at least
thirty spores including the ornamentation and calculating the mean. Mature spores only
were chosen for measurement, because of the great variation found as the spores
develop. Spines and other ornamentation are formed with the help of the ‘nurse cells’
(Castellano and Trappe, 1992). Such variation is also found between mature and
immature spores of Strobilomyces, but in a totally different way viz. without the help of
the ‘nurse cells’. Uncannily, the range of spore morphologies found in Strobilomyces is
very similar to that of Scleroderma, which they superficially resemble. Other characters
such as thickness of the peridium, glebal colour and external peridium characters were
observed using a x10 hand lens. All drawings were made with the aid of a Sony PASO
video printer attached to a microscope, rather than from photographic prints. Scanning
electron microscopy was carried out using air-dried, sputter -coated spores mounted on
conventional S.E.M. stubs, using a Philips 525M S.E.M.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examination of a wide range of specimens confirmed Guzman’s (1970) observation that
spore morphology fell into three morphotypes: spiny, sub-reticulate or reticulate. Within
those with spiny spores there are two distinctive groups; those with echinulate spines and
those with verrucose spines. All species can be easily assigned to one of these four
categories and typical examples of each are illustrated (Figs. 1-4). The light microscope
observations are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (Figs. 5-8). More detailed
examination of spore characteristics has enabled the separation of individual species
within these categories and a new key is reproduced below#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is also worth noting that although mature basidi of Pisolithus can be distinguished
from mature basidiomes of Scleroderma by the distinct peridioles, it can be difficult to
separate out young Scleroderma from Pisolithus. In Scleroderma, gleba are white when#Misc-exposition*]
[@405#Page-header*]

[@young, and composed of minute fragile walled peridioles which break down at an early
stage to pi a purple-bi or ch but fr ly tinted,#Misc-exposition*]

[@powdery mass, leaving no traces of the peridioles. In Pisolithus, gleba are composed of
brown, persistent, thick-walled peridioles which develop in sequence downwards and
always leave some peridioles at the base of an olivaceous yellow to brown powdery mass.
This emphasises the need to examine collections of specimens of mixed age.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES FOR THE SCLERODERMA KEY#Misc-exposition*]
[@Note One S.verrucosum#Misc-exposition*]

[@The distinctive verrucose nature of the peridium has resulted in many specimens being
placed in this taxon. From the material studied, however, there are two types of spore
ornamentation exhibited, viz. sharp narrow spines and blunt conical spines. As a
consequence, this species is keyed out in two positions of this key. More detailed studies
on a range of specimens will probably reveal that two autonomous species are included.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Two Scleroderma sp.\ and Scleroderma sp.2#Misc-exposition*]

[@These two entries refer to two new species from Malaysia. They will be described as
new species in a forthcoming publication (Sims and Watling, unpublished).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Three S.uruguayense#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type material authenticated by Guzman has echinulate spores, yet the original
description (Guzman, 1970) specified reticulate spores. We have placed S.uruguayense in
the Aculeatispora in accordance with the type material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Four S.cepa#Misc-exposition*]

[@Guzman (1970) considers the North American S.flavidum a synonym of S.cepa. Coccia
et al, (1990) separated S.flavidum by "a peridium with two microscopically
distinguished layers, the internal layer made up of large hyphae". Now this distinction has
been demonstrated, more detailed studies are required on a range of material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Five S.texense#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores of the type material are echinulate, whereas Guzmän (1970) described them
as sub-reticulate. The original description of this taxon (Berkeley, 1845) indicates that
the spores are "globose, granulated", i.e. covered with small particles or little grains.
This description fits the characteristics we found in the type specimen, therefore this
species falls within the Aculeatispora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Six S.chevalieri#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have not been able to obtain type material of this species, but Guzman (1970)
described the spores as sub-reticulate with long spines. We have therefore placed it in
the section Sclerangium#Misc-exposition*]

[@Note Seven S.citrinum#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore ornamentation of this species seems to vary greatly between sub-reticulate or
catenulate spores, to mildly or strongly reticulate spores. There would appear to be a
continuum of variation, and does not merit establishing different species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@410#Page-header*]
[@Note Eight S.meridionale#Misc-exposition*]

[@Demoulin and Malengon described this species in 1971, although it probably includes
S.macrorrhizon of Wallroth (1833). Since there is no type material for the latter,and the
description is inadequate by modern standards, it is impossible to use with conviction
Wallroth’s species. Demoulin and Malengon believe that S.macrorrhizon sensu Guzman
is a synonym of S.meridionale.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The members of the Sclerodermataceae are known to be important ectomycorrhizal
symbionts, and are being used in inoculation programmes for reafforestation (Smits,

is known, so that appropriate host/fungal combinations can be selected. The key has the#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abstract: The synonymy of Tulostoma readerii and T.fimbriatum s.lato is
proposed based on the study of the type material of the former species.
Some photographs under light and scanning electron microscope are
presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Key words. Gasteromycetes, taxonomy, Tulostoma fimbriatum, Tulostoma
readerii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the genus Tulostoma Pers.: Pers. are included still doubtful
or "critical" species that must be restudied. Some of them have been
scantily collected; others have holotypes in very poor shape or are lost.
Sometimes, the problem is that access to collections in some herbaria is
restricted. In the past years we have attempted to solve some of these
taxonomical problems proposing some synonymies, viz.: 7.simulans Lloyd
and T.beccarianum Bres. (ALTÉS & MORENO, 1993); T.squamosum
Gmel.:Pers., 7:verrucosum Morg. and T.mussooriense P.Henn. (MORENO
et aL, 1992);  T.subfuscum White and T:hollosii Moravec, and the
combination T.pulchellum Sacc. var. subfuscum (White) Wright, Moreno &
Altes (MORENO et al., 1992). In this paper we have centered our study on
Tulostoma readerii Lloyd, taxon described (LLOYD, 1906) on the basis of
material collected by Mr. F.M.Reader in Australia, and whose distribution
was restricted to that country.#Misc-exposition*]
[@422#Page-header*]
[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The material studied was requested on loan from The National
Fungus Collections, Beltsville, Maryland, U.S.A. (BPI), and was compared
with collections from the following herbaria: University of Baja California,
Ensenada, Mexico (BCMEX), Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris,
France (PC), and University of Alcala, Madrid, Spain (AH).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The methods used to obtain the photographs under light and
scanning electron microscope are those indicated in MORENO et al.
(1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@To determine the color of the gleba we have followed LOCQUIN
(1975), indicating within brackets the corresponding color code.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: | WRIGHT (1987) considers 7ulostoma readerii a
species close to T.fimbriatum Fr. var. campestre (Morgan) Moreno.
LLOYD himself (1906) points to the similarity between the new species he
describes and T:granulosum Lév., which is now accepted as a synonym of
T.frimbriatum. The differences between the 6 varieties plus a form of
T.fimbriatum recognized by WRIGHT (1987) are dubious to us, for which
reason we prefer to consider only a single taxon 7:fimbriatum s.lato. This
includes basidiocarps of variable size, with a typically frimbriate mouth,
sometimes denticulate, a clearly hyphal exoperidium mixed with sand
grains or soil, cream coloured to pale ochre endoperidium, which may be
smooth or pitted from the sand grains, ferrugineous gleba, spores of fairly
variable size with a clear verrucose-echinulate ornamentation under LM,
which under SEM is formed by crests and verrucae of variable length,
which sometimes appear as subreticulate (figs. 7-8); capillitium subhyaline
with thick walls, somewhat enlarged at the slightly ochre septa. Since
T.fimbriatum is one of the most common taxa in Europe, we have been able
to study in the last few years numerous collections, mostly Spanish and
extant in AH, but also some from other countries, of which only a few have
been listed among the material studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The study of the holotype of T. readerii, particularly of its sporal

[@1. ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@A detailed and extensively illustrated description of Lactarius
chromospermus Pegler, first described from Zambia, is provided on the basis
of abundant material from miombo woodland in Burundi (Central Africa).
Its ectomycorrhizal association with Brachystegia is demonstrated.
Microscopic features of the type material are reexamined and compared with
those of the collections from Burundi. Its systematic position is discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@PEGLER (1983) described Lactarius chromospermus from a single
collection made by ROSE in the miombo woodlands in Luapala Prov.,
Zambia. This Lactarius species extends considerably the concept of
Russulales because of its dark brown spore-print. Notwithstanding this
important difference, Pegler included it in Lactarius sect. Dulces R. Heim
ex Singer subsect. Lactifluini (Burl.) Singer because of inferred relationships
with Lactarius volemus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@428#Page-header*]

[@3. MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present description is based on specimens collected during
1991-1993 in western Burundi by the senior author (priv. coll.) and in 1994
by both authors (coll. VERBEKEN, deposited at BR and GENT).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic features are studied in congo-red in NH,OH (eventually
after a short passage in KOH 10% solution). Spore ornamentation is
described and illustrated as observed in Melzer's reagent. Terminology of
cystidial elements is according to BUYCK (1991). Line-drawings are made
by VERBEKEN with the aid of a drawing tube at magnifications 6700x for
spores, 3200x for individual elements and 1100x for sections and surface
views. Stippling indicates refractive contents in cystidia and lactifers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores are measured in side view in Melzer's reagent, excluding the
ornamentation and measurements are given as (MINa) [AVa-2*SD] - AVa -
AVb - [AVb + 2*SD] (MAXb) in which AVa = lowest mean value for the
measured collections, AVb = greatest mean value and SD = standard
deviation. Q stands for "quotient length/width" and is given as (MINQa) Qa
- Qb (MAXQb) in which Qa, respectively Qb, stand for the lowest,
respectively the highest, mean quotient for the measured specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colour codes are from KORNERUP & WANSCHER (1978). L+l/cm
means number of lamellae (L) and lamellulae (1) per cm at pileus mid-
radius. Names of phytogeographical regions and vegetation types are
according to WHITE (1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. DESCRIPTION OF THE COLLECTING SITES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most specimens were collected on the eastern slope of Nkayamba
hill at the northern limit of Rumonge, a small town at the border of lake
Tanganyika, approximately 70 km S of Bujumbura. Some of the specimens
were collected at Nyamirambo, a few km SE of Nkayamba. Mean annual
rainfall in this region is 1057.3 mm for the period 1980-1986 (IGEBU, 1986
- Observations stopped in 1987), but with important differences between
years. Precipitation is most abundant in November, December and April.
Mean annual temperature for the same period was 23.75 °C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The vegetation at Nkayamba consists of an old Brachystegia
woodland dominated by B. microphylla Harms, near the summit, B. bussei
Harms and B. utilis Burtt Davy and Hutch. on the lower slope, and B.
spiciformis Benth. growing more dispersed over the entire slope. All
examined Brachystegia species are proven to be ectomycorrhizal (HOGBERG,
1982; HOGBERG & PIEARCE, 1986). Near the top, the vegetation develops on#Misc-exposition*]
[@429#Page-header*]

[@an acid sandy soil (pH 4.6 on the upper slope) which is severely eroded
showing abundant rock debris everywhere. The organic superficial layer is
very thin, but most of the remaining surface is covered with well-developed
moss cushions of Leucobryum madagassum Besch. and Campylopus
savannarum (C. Müll.) Mitt. Towards the lower slope, the soil becomes
more basic (pH 5.3) and contains up to 50% clay (NZIGIDAHERA, 1993);
mosses and rocks are replaced by various herbs and grasses. The site is
under great demographic pressure and trees are being cut at an alarming rate.
These clearings result in drought stress during most of the year and
mushrooms are only abundant in weeks of heavy rain fall, especially at the
beginning of the rainy season (Nov.-Dec.). Nkayamba has been visited
almost weekly during the entire period.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nyamirambo hill belongs to a protected woodland area which was
exploited until 1972, mainly for the cultivation of manioc. Since the creation
of the forest reserve, a young and dynamic woodland forest developed in the
area. The limy soil shows less rock debris, and supports a relatively dense
vegetation with numerous young shoots of Brachystegia and Uapaca. This
results in well buffered microclimate with an almost equal seasonal
distribution of mushroom basidiomes (Oct.-Nov. to May-June). Dominant
ectomycorrhizal trees are Brachystegia bussei and especially B. utilis and
Uapaca nitida Müll.-Arg.. Occasionally, B. spiciformis, Isoberlinia
angolensis (Welw. ex Benth.) Hoyle & Brenan and, near the top, B.
microphylla constitute the other ectotrophic partners.#Misc-exposition*]

(1994b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@VERNACULAR NAMES AND ETHNOMYCOLOGICAL NOTES: The people
of Rumonge call L. chromospermus "Igisazi", which is a general name for
inedible mushrooms. Although only few species in Russulaceae are
consumed in Burundi (BUYCK, 1994b), this rejection might be related to the
dark brown lamellae, which give the species the appearance of an Agaricus,
a genus usually regarded as being toxic in Africa (see e.g. BUYCK, 1994b;
HARKONEN et al., 1993; RAMMELOO & WALLEYN, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY: The collections from Nkayamba show a clear preference
for the wetter parts on the limy soil, where hundreds of carpohores were
found. When considering the closest tree(s) to the carpohores as the most
likely ectomycorrhizal host(s), L. chromospermus might have been associated
13 times with B. utilis, 8 times with B. bussei, 5 times with B. microphylla
and once with B. spiciformis. These observations, together with the
additional data from the Tanzanian collections (see above), seem to indicate
that L. chromospermus forms only ectomycorrhizal associations with
Brachystegia species. However, ectomycorrhizal associations with other tree
genera can not be excluded as this seems a common phenomena in tropical
Africa (see HARKONEN, BUYCK et al., 1993, BUYCK et al., 1995). High host
specificity might be confined to more or less monospecific or single-
dominant vegetation types, as is often the case in colder climates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6.2 Systematic position#Misc-exposition*]

[@We can not find any close affinities with the other African Lactarii
described by HEIM (1938, 1955). The exceptional dark brown spore-print of
L. chromospermus might argue in favour of placing this species in a
monotypic section or even in a separate subgenus in Lactarius. However, as
one of us (A.V.) is now studying tropical members of the genus Lactarius,
we prefer to assign this species provisionally to one of the already
recognized groups in Lactarius untill we have a more complete picture of
the genus in the tropics.#Misc-exposition*]
[@433#Page-header*]

[@We do not consider L. volemus (Fr.) Fr. to be closely related to L.
chromospermus (Pegler, 1982) because both species have very different
types of cystidia and pileipellis. When comparing the features of L.
chromospermus with other Lactarii (TABLE 2), most resemblances are found
with species such as L. pallidus (Pers.: Fr.) Fr. or L. trivialis (Fr.: Fr.) Fr.
belonging to the subgenus Russularia (Fr.: Kauffman) sect. Trivialis Hesler
& A.H. Sm. Most important difference, apart from spore colour, resides in
the often strong viscosity of the latter group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Like many other Leguminosae, Vicia sativa is frequently
contaminated by Ascochyta species such as A. viciae Lib., A. pisi
Lib., A. viciae-villosae Ondrej, A. punctata Naumov (SPRAGUE,
1929; LEACH, 1962; EL SHANAWANI and OUSPENSKAIA, 1978;
RICHARDSON, 1979; BOEREMA and VERHOEVEN, 1979, ONDREJ,
1968 ). In Algeria A. viciae and A. viciae-villosae are the most
frequent (MOHAMMEDI, 1984; BOUZNAD, 1989; BENELMOUFFOK,
1993). They cause on leaves, stems and pods characteristic
symptoms of blight : necrotic spots with dark margin and
concentrical black pycnidia in the middle ( JELLIS and
PUNITHALINGAM, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A. viciae is not easy to differenciate and identify precisely by
morphological data only. Specificity of the pathogenicity on Vicia
and observation of the teleomorph may be very useful to precise
and confirm the identification.#Misc-exposition*]
[@444#Page-header*]

[@Since 1991, frequent prospections in Vicia sativa fields in
humid region of Collo mountains (N.E. Algeria) have shown
ascomata mixed with pycnidia on overwintered stems of Vicia
Sativa. Mycosphaerella pinodes (Berkeley & Bloxam) Vestergen
(current name Didymella pinodes (Berkeley & Bloxam)),
Mycosphaerella viciarum Petrak and Didymella fabae (Jellis &
Punithalingam) were already described on various Vicia species
except V. sativa. So it appears we discovered a new teleomorph on
Vicia sativa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials and methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pycnidia and pycniospores were observed on fresh leaves,
stems and pods collected in spring and ascomata and ascospores
on stems collected in January, after overwintering.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological observations were performed on fresh
material as well as on cultures obtained from ascospores collected
in situ and pycnidiospores collected in situ et in vitro with the
mean of a micromanipulator. Fungi were cultivated on Mathur
agar medium and incubated at 20-22°C under daylight.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pathogenicity and host specificity of the isolates were
evaluated by inoculation of pycniospores freshly isolated or
obtained from culture, on the most important food legumes Vicia
sativa, Vicia faba, Pisum sativum and Lens culinaris . Disease effect
was evaluated on 5-7 days old plants after artificial inoculation
under controled conditions. The inoculum consisted of a
suspension of 106 conidia/ml prepared from ten days old cultures
(Mathur medium). After inoculation, plants were incubated under
plastic film to maintain saturated humidity, for 72 hours . After
that period, inoculated plants were sprayed with distilled water 4-5
times each day to help development of the disease. Symptoms
(leaf and stem spots) were noted 2 weeks after inoculation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

mean of 16,78 µm long and 4,5 µm wide (2,5-6,25 µm). Rarely
conidia are mono- or tricellular. They are hyaline, straight, slightly
truncate at the base rounded at the apex. In culture, thalli are
constituted of white appressed mycelium with numerous brown
pycnidia in concentrical disposition. Chlamydospores are frequent.

[@Specificity of the parasite#Misc-exposition*]

[@Inoculations were performed with conidia obtained from

on Pisum sativum, Lens culinaris, Vicia faba and Vicia sativa. Blight
symptoms were observed only on Vicia sativa after two weeks on
leaves and stems of inoculated plants. This result confirms the
pathogenic specificity of the fungus isolated from Vicia sativa .#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Similarity in pathogenic, morphological and cultural features
of conidiomata obtained either directly from the anamorph
Ascochyta viciae isolated on Vicia sativa or from cultures
originated from ascospores of the teleomorph on the host,
provides with evidence of the existence of an holomorph:
Ascochyta viciae - Didymella viciae sp. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

Kaiser and Hellier (1993) found a new species of Didymella
teleomorph of Ascochyta fabae f. sp. lentis on Lens culinaris.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Didymella differs from Mycosphaerella in having
ascospores that are broader and more constricted at the septa, the
presence of pseudoparaphyses and larger ascomata (LUTTRELL,
1973; HANLIN, 1990). The features are observed in the teleomorph
of Ascochyta viciae wich therefore belongs Didymella species. D.
viciae is different from D. fabae and M. pinodes parasitic on Vicia
spp for two reasons: the anamorph Ascochyta viciae is
morphologically distinct from A. pinodes and the two morphs
(ana- and teleomorph) are exclusively parasitic on Vicia sativa and
not on Vicia faba, Pisum sativum and Lens culinaris. Nevertheless,#Misc-exposition*]

[@as shown in table 1, A. viciae and A. lJentis are morphologically

very close to A. fabae. Relationships between these three species

[@A species of endophytic Rhizomucor was isolated from wheat collected
on 28 February 1994 in the greenhouse of the Institute of Crop Cultivation,
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The wheat samples were carefully examined in our laboratory to ensure
that no symptomatic infections could be found. Twenty plates were used for
isolation. Healthy wheat leaves were cut down, washed with distilled water
many times, and with sterile distilled water two times before submerging in
75% ethanol for 1 min., followed by 1:3 (Plates 1-7), 1:4 (Plates 8-13), and
1:5 (Plates 14-20) dilutions of water and NaCIO for 5 min., and again by a
75% ethanol for 30 sec. and washed with sterile distilled water two times.
The wheat leaves were then cut in pieces and placed three by three onto each
of the isolation plates. Malt Extract Agar (MA, consisting 2% malt extract
and 2% agar) with the addition of 50 ppm chlor-tetracycline after sterilization
at 15 lbs for 20 min., was used as isolation medium. The plates were
incubated at 25°C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From three to four days onwards, abundant mycelia of several kinds were
seen to grow out from the surface of many of the wheat leaves in Plates 14-
20 and a few of those in Plates 8-13. The wheat leaves in Plates 1-7
remained sterile until three weeks later, mycelia were seen to grow out from
the cut margin of the wheat leaves in Plate 7. This fungus was believed to
be an endophyte since it grew out from the cut margin instead of the surface
of the wheat leaves and did not seem likely to be a saprobe which survived
surface sterilization. The mycelia from the cut margin of the leaf pieces in
Plate 7 were then transferred to other MA plates for sexuality study or to
Synthetic Mucor Agar (SMA, consisting dextrose 2 g, asparagine 2 g,
KH,PO, 0.5 g, MgSO, - 7H,O 0.25 g, thiamine chloride 0.5 mg, agar 15 g,
dist. H,O 1000 ml) plates for taxonomic study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After growing at 25°C for four days, the mycelia filled the petri dish and
turned black with the formation of numerous zygospores. When examined
under the microscope, the fungus was found to be a new species of
zygomycetes pertaining to the genus Rhizomucor of the Mucoraceae
(Mucorales). The fungus is homothallic since all subcultures resulted from
single-spored isolation persisted in producing numerous zygospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As pointed out by Petrini & Muller (1986), the most frequently isolated
endophytes are the deuteromycetes, whereas ascomycetes and very few
basidiomycetes and oomycetes have also been reported. Endophytic
zygomycetes seem to be rare and only members of the Mucorales have been
reported so far. Mortierella vinacea Dixon Stewart from fruticose lichens
(Petrini et al., 1990), Absidia cylindrospora Hagem, and Mortierella spp.
from bracken (Petrini er al., 1993) are few of the examples. Endophytic
zygomycetes from higher plants seem to be even rarer, however, Petrini
(personal communication) stated that Fisher and himself have occasionally
isolated Mucorales, particularly Rhizopus, as endophytes of higher plants.
Discovery of Rhizomucor endophyticus in wheat has shown that more
zygomycetes might be expected to be found as endophytes from higher
plants.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Greek or Crimean Juniper (Juniperus excelsa M.Bicb.) is an
evergreen tree of a middle height (15-20 m) with a pyramidal dark-green crown
and scale-like leaves. The area of distribution reaches from Iran through Asia
Minor, Crimea up to Balkan Peninsula (Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia). In
Macedonia it is distributed in several localities along the river Vardar and some
of its tributaries, as well as in the region of the lake Prespa. It occurs in
xerothermic sites, most frequently on limestone, diabase or serpentine, and
often forms rather small, almost pure associations, not higher than 1100 m alt.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Greek Juniper forms two associations in Macedonia: Pruno webbii-
Juniperetum excelsae Em (57)62 and Juniperetum excelsae-foetidissimae Em
65. Investigations were carried out in the former which is the most frequent
and the mostly spread onc. Juniperus excelsa is dominant and Carpinus
orientalis, Phillyrea media, Prunus webbii and Celtis glabrara (this one only
on the islet Golem Grad) are admixed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Only two species growing on wood of this juniper were published up
to now (Pilát 1937, 1936-42, Koleva-Sekutkovska 1959, Tortic 1987,1988).

the localities investigated during almost every visit.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Somewhat less frequent were: Amylostereum laevigatum, Gloeophyl-
lum abietinum, Hymenochaete fulliginosa, Hyphodontia arguta, Peniophora
junipericola, Phellinus ferruginosus and Radulomyces rickii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rare, some found only once or twice were: Arhelia neuhofii, Gloeocys-

Scytinostroma aluta, Steccherinum litschaueri, Stereum hirsutum, Subulicys-
tidium longisporum, Trechispora farinacea, Tubulicrinis calothrix,
T.gracilimus, T.medius, T.sororius and Vesiculomyces citrinus; a number of
them belongs to rather frequent species in Macedonia and in other countries.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several fungi grow predominantly or exclusively on various species of
the genus Juniperus, as Amylostereum laevigatum, Antrodia juniperina,
Hyphodontia juniperi, Peniophora junipericola and Pyrofomes demidoffü,
while Gloeophyllum abietinum, Hymenochaete fulliginosa, Hyphoderma pal-
lidum and Vesiculomyces citrinus are typical for conifers. The rest of the
species grow on conifers as well as on deciduous trees and shrubs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Particularly interesting are Antrodia juniperina, Hyphodontia juniperi,
Pyrofomes demidoffii, Peniophora junipericola and Hyphoderma pallidum.
Their distribution and hosts are here discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Antrodia juniperina is known in East Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya and
Tanzania) as a parasite and saprophyte on thick trunks of Juniperus procera
(Niemela & Ryvarden 1975). In the USA it grows on Juniperus deppeana,
J.monosperma, J.osteosperma and J.virginiana (Gilbertson & Ryvarden
1986), and in Europe only in Spain on Juniperus thurifera (Garcia-Manjon &
Moreno 1981) and Bulgaria on Juniperus excelsa (Ryvarden & Gilbertson
1993). This species is frequent in all the investigated localities and grows as
a saprophyte, rarely as a parasite on old trunks of J. excelsa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphoderma pallidum is a rare species preferring conifers. According
to Lecot (1984) in France it grows on Cupressus macrocarpa, in Spain on
Pinus silvestris (Telleria & Truchero), in Portugal on Pinus (Melo & Cardoso
1985) and in Austria on Castanea, Pinus etc. (Hallenberg & Mitschelitsch
1982-83). In Scandinavia it grows on conifers: Juniperus communis, Picea
abies and Pinus silvestris, but also on Alnus (Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975). In
Former Yugoslavia this species is known from two localities, in Plitvice#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Croatia) on Picea and Abies (Torti¢é 1985) and in Trnovo near Sarajevo on
Picea (M.Tortic - personal communication). In Macedonia it was collected
only once on the islet Golem Grad on a dead branch of J. excelsa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphodontia juniperi grows chiefly on dead branches of Juniperus
spp-, but it also occurs on deciduous trees. In the north of Europe it has been
collected only in Sweden. Bourdot and Galzin found it to be a frequently
occurring species on Juniperus in Central France, where it was collected on
Pyrus and Robinia. It also occurs on Crete on Cupressus, in Spain on Juniperus
and in Iran on Buxus (Eriksson, Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1981). According to
M.Tortic (personal communications) in Former Yugoslavia (Slovenia and
Croatia) it occurs on several localities where it grows on Abies, Clematis,
Taxus and Juniperus communis. There are two localities in Macedonia: on the
mountain Jakupica on Carpinus betulus and in Porece on J.excelsa (Torti¢
1988).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species is frequent in all the investigated localities, occurring as a
saprophyte on dead branches of the Greek juniper. According to the finds up
to now, it prefers dry and warm arcas with high temperatures showing a

[@Peniophora junipericola occurs on dead, still attached branches of
Juniperus spp. In Sweden, France and Estonia was collected on Juniperus
communis (Eriksson & al. 1981); in Spain onJuniperus oxycedrus (Garcia-Ma-
njon & Moreno 1981). It was collected in many localities in Macedonia,
particularly on the mountain Galicica and on the islet Golem Grad on Juniperus
oxycedrus and J. excelsa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pyrofomes demidoffii is a dangerous parasite of various Juniperus spp.
in East Africa (Ryvarden & Johansen 1980) and is also frequent on species of
this genus in North America (Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1987). Bondartsev
(1971) mentions its finds in Caucasus, Uzbekistan, Siberia, Crimea, mostly
on Juniperus spp., but also on Cupressus and Pinus. He considers it to be a
subtropical species. It also occurs in Bulgaria on Juniperus excelsa (Ryvarden
& Gilbertson 1993). For Macedonia it was published by Pilat (1937, 1936-42)
from the vicinity of the lake Ohrid on Cupressus sempervirens. Later it was
reported by Koleva-Sekutkovska (1959) from Katlanovo on Juniperus excelsa,
and recently it was collected at lake Prespa, also on Juniperus excelsa (Torti¢
1987). Ryvarden (1991) has made a map of distribution of P.demidoffii in the
world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species is frequent on all the investigated areas of Greek juniper
in Macedonia. It is a parasite on old trunks and causes considerable damages
in juniper associations. It is particularly frequent in the vicinity of Katlanovo
where about 30 € of J. excelsa is infected by this parasitc. In the vicinity of the
lake Ohrid, on Cupressus, this species was not found repeated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat and ecology. The type collection grew on putrescent stipes of Athyrium
filix-femina and occasionally on thin branches and leaves of deciduous trees.
Other known collections are all growing on small wood pieces, presumably
from deciduous trees. Hauersley (herbarium notations) reports Salix sp,
Sambucus nigra and Crataegus sp as substrates from Denmark. The type locality
is a small moist to wet deciduous forest. It is situated close to lake Mjórn and
is seasonally flooded by the lake, especially in spring-time. Dominating trees
are Alnus glutinosa, Salix spp, Betula spp, Fraxinus excelsior and Prunus padus. At
dryer places also some Quercus robur occur. The forest floor is covered by
grasses, sedges and herbs that are typical of moist woodland, meadows and
riverside vegetation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Hyphodontiella (Strid 1975) was described with only one species, H.
multiseptata Strid. Its unique characters are the presence of numerous unclam-
ped septa at subicular hyphae and an unusual spore morphology (Eriksson &
Ryvarden 1976). The inclusion of H. hauerslevii imposes some changes on the
limits of the genus as it was first outlined. In the genus description basal
hyphae were said to have thickened walls but in the species described here
hyphae are everywhere thin-walled. Subhymenial hyphae were said to be
clamped in H. multiseptata but in H. hauerslevii they are clamp-less. The genus
is described as lacking cystidia but the new species has conspicuous cystidia.
None of these differences implies any drastic shift in the scope of the genus
but gives, what concerns clamp-connexions, a better understanding of the
true nature of the clamp-less septa in H. multiseptata. These septa are probably
not, as was said in the protologue, adventitious but true, doliporous septa. The
presence of clamp-connexions is a variable feature in both species but with
different patterns.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The branching of the basal hyphae has one characteristic that gives a
striking resemblance to Hyphodontia. Hyphae branching off at more or less
right angles are noticably constricted close to the branching point. This
feature is most pronounced in H. multiseptata, probably because of its thicker
cell walls.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basidial clamp in both species is often loop-like and almost invariably
involves a second, basidiole-like cell which further development is unclear. It
seems that the clamp-formation is delayed and that the apical cell developes
almost to a mature basidium before the clamp-connexion is closed. Unfinis-
hed clamp-connexions are seen as hooks on young basidia. This ansiform
nature of basidial clamps is most prominent in H. hauerslevii but can be seen
also in H. multseptata, though neither discussed by Strid (1975) nor by Eriksson
and Ryvarden (1976). Typical ansiform clamp-connexions occur in Paullicor-
ticium ansatum Liberta and proliferating clamp-connexions have been descri-
bed by Rogers (1936) in a species of Sebacina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two species have similarities in their ecology. H. multiseptata has several
times been collected in moist forests where flooding is not uncommon. It
seems to grow on a diversity of substrates and is occasionally collected on fern#Misc-exposition*]
[@478#Page-header*]

[@remains. However, it has also a place in subalpine stands of Betula tortuosa and
Salix spp (Hjortstam and Johannesen 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The presence of two-sterigmate specimens of H. hauerslevii could be a
taxonomical problem, but considering the variable occurrance of clamp-con-
nexions, a variation in number of sterigmata is not unexpected. We have
choosen not to make number of sterigmata a species delimiting character
since there is a full agreement among other characteristics. Also, collections
with two sterigmata are invariably very meager and with tiny basidiomata
which could indicate that such individuals are haploid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This easily recognizable species was reported earlier from Hungary by Gónczól
& Tóth (1974) and Révay (1986) as a rare element of the Hungarian mycoflora.
Subsequently this species has been collected several times and altogether 33
collections of O. trigonella are known from Hungary. It is interesting to note that O.
trigonella on 17 occasions was found on stems of Fumana procumbens from a total of
12 different localities (unpublished). Its frequent occurrence on Fumana procumbens
perhaps indicates that this substratum is one which is readily colonized by
O. trigonella. Despite of its common occurrence in Hungary it is scanty recorded in
the world literature. Kirk (1983) reported O. trigonella from the British Isles as a rare
species which is represented in herb. IMI by only four collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Oncopodiella Arnaud ex Rifai is a small genus containing up to the present
time four species. The previously monotypic genus was based on Oncopodiella
trigonella (Sacc.) Rifai. Subsequently, the following 3 additional species of
Oncopodiella have been described: O. - hyperparasitica D. Hawksw. (Hawksworth &
Punithaling: 1975), O. i hima (1981), O. cubensis G. Arnold &
Castaneda (1986).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two species described here can easily be included in the genus
Oncopodiella on the basis of the morphology of conidiogenous cell and conidia. Of
the two new species, O. robusta shows some affinities with O. cubensis but differs in
its narrower conidia with less variable septation and in the arrangement of the horns.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological Studies. Observations of fruiting structures in

were made at 7-14 days and in solid and liquid media at 14 days.
Cultures were maintained at 25C under a 12 hr light/12 hr dark
cycle. The kale and Tyfon isolates of Phytophthora were similar
m hologically. On corn meal agar, both exhibited considerable
fluffy aerial growth. Hyphae were up to 8 µm wide. Hyphal
swellings were rare in both corn meal and clarified V-8 juice agar,
and in liquid 1/5 strength V-8 juice culture media. Hyphal
swellings and sporangia of both isolates occurred frequently on
mycelium attached to infected host plant seedlings when placed in

older sporangia could be classified as having papilla, especially

the fungus were formed and released from sporangia. Sporangia
appeared to be ovoid to obpyriform in shape. Sporangia#Misc-exposition*]
[@485#Page-header*]

[@measurements varied considerably; 27-44 x 41-62 µm with a
mean of 35 x 52 µm for the kale isolate and 27-37 x 36-57 µm
with a mean of 32 x 44 µm for the Tyfon isolate. These
measurements were similar to those previously described for P.
megasperma from cauliflower by Tompkins et al. (1936) in
California. Sporangia usually were single, produced on a long
thin sporangiophore and were non-caducous. No sporangia were
observed on solid media. In the presence of host seedlings in
water, extended internal proliferation of the sporangia was
observed. Sometimes sympodial arrangement of sporangia was
observed in water cultures, especially in the presence of secondary
host (alfalfa) seedlings (Figure 1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Oospores of kale and Tyfon isolates were abundant on corn meal
agar and liquid V-8 juice culture media. Oogonia were spherical
and oospore walls were smooth. Oospores of both isolates were
produced readily in host tissue of seedlings in water cultures and
to a lesser extent in mycelium attached to the seedlings.#Misc-exposition*]

[@produced in the host tissue tended to be smaller than those
produced in solid culture media. The minimum and maximum
oogonia diameters for the kale isolate were 27 µm and 58.5 µm,
respectively (mean of 48 µm). The minimum and maximum
oogonia diameters for the Tyfon isolate were 46 µm and 62 µm,
respectively (mean of 54 µm). Oogonia from these isolates were
larger than those described for P. megasperma from cauliflower
by Tompkins et al. (1936) in California, but were similar in size to
those described by Hamm & Koepsell (1984) in Oregon from
cabbage and cauliflower. Also Drechsler (1931), in his original
description of P. megasperma indicated oogonia size as 47 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Oospores of the Australian isolate were readily produced in solid
corn meal agar culture media. Oogonia were spherical and
oospore walls were smooth. Oospores were also produced in
tissue of Tyfon seedlings placed in water culture containing
mycellium plugs. The minimum and maximum oogonia diameter
were 30.2 µm and 39.9 µm (mean of 34.4 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Great Britain isolate did not produce oospores in either solid
media or seedlings of Tyfon or Kale and was assumed to be
heterothallic.#Misc-exposition*]
[@486#Page-header*]

[@The P. cryptogea isolate from sugar beet produced small (27 x
38 µm) sporangia, rarely on solid media. However, when sugar
beet seedlings were placed into petri dishes containing water and
agar plugs of the fungus, irregular shaped sporangia were
observed. No oospores were observed in liquid or solid media
suggesting the possibility of heterothallism. Thompson and
Phillips (1988) reported an isolate of P. drechsleri from cabbage
to be heterothallic. On solid media, hyphal swellings of the
fungus were abundant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The alfalfa isolate formed oospores in tissue of alfalfa seedlings in
water cultures and in corn meal and clarified V-8 juice agar media.
Oogonia had a mean diameter of 31 µm and oospores had a mean
diameter of 26 µm. Sporangia and hyphal swellings were readily
formed on seedlings placed in water cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Temperature Studies. All six isolates grown on corn meal agar
were more tolerant of temperatures below 25°C than temperatures
above 25°C. None of the isolates grew at 35°C. Only limited
growth of isolates was observed at 5°C. Most of the time, kale
and Tyfon isolates grew faster than the alfalfa isolate and
generally, the growth rate of kale and Tyfon isolates were similar.
Cardinal temperatures for growth of the kale and tyfon isolates
were 0-5°C, 25°C, 30-35°C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Optimum growth temperature for P. megasperma isolates from
Brassica spp. was previously reported to be 25°C (Tompkins et
al., 1936; Jones, 1952; Cvjetkovic et al., 1983). This temperature
was also the optimum growth temperature for P. megasperma, in
general (Waterhouse and Waterston, 1966). All of the four
Phytophthora isolates from Brassica spp. included in this study
also grew best at 25°C. Jones (1952) reported minimum
temperature for growth of P. megasperma from Brassica spp. as
slightly below 5°C which was in agreement with our study.

9.1 and 4.3 mm in PDA.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pathogenicity Tests. In growth chamber pathogenicity tests, the
alfalfa isolate of P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis was
pathogenic to seedlings of 'Premier' kale, 'Tyfon', ‘Emerald’ rape
as well as 'Ranger' alfalfa. However, it was more virulent to
alfalfa. Average percent mortality for kale, rape, Tyfon and alfalfa
after 21 days at 25C under a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle was 15,
24, 30 and 100, respectively when inoculated at seeding.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Phytophthora isolates from kale and Tyfon were similarly
pathogenic to seedlings of kale, rape, Tyfon and alfalfa with
average percent mortalities of 83 and 53, 87 and 94, 68 and 64,
and 61 and 58, respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the older (4-month-old) plant studies, the kale and Tyfon
isolates induced root rot in both kale and Tyfon but not in alfalfa,
while P. megasperma f. sp. medicaginis induced root rot only in
alfalfa. Overall, the kale and Tyfon isolates had a wider host
range, but were less pathogenic than the alfalfa isolate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Monographic treatments of basidiomycetes from the
family Corticiaceae are indeed rare. There are only a few
specialists in the world dealing with Corticiaceae taxonomy and
generic delimitation is frequently a great obstacle. The genus
Hyphodontia is one of the few groups of corticioids which are
possible to recognize by traditional methods.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book presented here covers the known species in
the world. Together with Hyphodontia-like species in other
genera, 60 species are treated. A comprehensive introduction
contains details on micromorphology, a formal emendation of
the genus Hyphodontia and keys to the species. Species
descriptions make up most of the book and these are
excellently worked out. Nomenclature and morphological
descriptions are followed by line drawings of microscopic
details and sections of basidiomata. Of particular value for the
user are comments following each species description, where
differences between closely related taxa and possible
misdeterminations are presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One new species is described and five new combinations
are made in Hyphodontia. The genera Schizopora and
Echinoporia are treated together with species of Hyphodontia.
There is no doubt about their close affinities. This has been
convincingly shown by Langer and others in micro-
morphology of basidiomata, culture characters (presence of
drepanocysts and malocysts), and parenthosome structure,
which is of a continuous type. The main reason for not
including them all in one genus is because of nomenclatural
changes which would be inevitable, as Schizopora was
described well before Hyphodontia. This situation is solved by
retaining the genera Schizopora and Echinoporia for the few
species treated there and which moreover are morphologically
well distinguished from other hyphodontioid fungi. Seven
species described in Hyphodontia or Schizopora during the last
decades are excluded from these genera.#Misc-exposition*]
[@492#Page-header*]

[@The book ends up with a cladistic analysis based on
morphological characters. This is another feature of this
publication which rarely is seen in taxonomic works with
basidiomycetes. This is also something which is difficult to
perform because of the high number of parallellisms in
character evolution and the small number of available,
informative characters. Langer tries to solve the situation by
prescribing the transformation of character states for a great
number of characters. Even if these operations make the
analysis weak, the principal infrageneric division will
probably survive. This is linked to the presence of tramal
cystidia or hymenial cystidia. It also seems to be obvious that
the different hymenophore configurations are examples of
parallellism. | DNA sequencing will hopefully be the way to
offer more reliable phylogenetic estimates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Atlas of Clinical Fungi edited by G. S. de Hoog and J.
Guarro was written to illustrate the diversity of medically
important fungi. To achieve this goal, the editors divided the
book into two portions. Part one contains discussions on
classification, clinical pathology, natural ecology, general
techniques, and a brief review of the major pathogenic fungi.
Part two is reserved for rare and unusual opportunistic
pathogens of medical and veterinary interest. This portion of
the book is richly illustrated with superb line drawings and
beautiful scanning electron and light microscopy
photomicrographs of the morphological features used to
recognize the various taxa of interest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pythium  insidiosum is an important oomycete pathogen
primarily of veterinary interest that many mycologists
consider to be a member of either the kingdom Chromista or
Protoctista. The treatment of P. insidiosum as a fungus seems
inappropriate. 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences, as well as
other data, indicate that Pneumocystis carinii should be#Misc-exposition*]

[@classified among the early ascomycetes. The treatment of P.
carinii as a zygomycete will cause confusion for the readers of
the book. Additional confusion results from the classification
of Bipolaris australiensis, B. hawaiiensis, and B. spicifera in
the genus Drechslera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The discussion included in the section Clinical Pathology
presents several difficulties. There is no need to create the
superfluous disease name mucoralomycosis. Most medical
mycologists consider superficial, cutaneous, subcutaneous,
systemic, and allergic as the principal clinical categories for
fungal diseases based upon location rather than that stated on
p. 17. Table 3 (p. 17) contains several errors regarding the
histopathology of the mycoses. Penicillium marneffei is a
classic dimorphic pathogen and it is not classifiable in the
Onygenales (p. 22-23).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Zootropic fungi are described as "...requiring living
tissue for growth, at least during a part of the life cycle..." on
p. 27. The dimorphic fungi were given as examples. The
dimorphic fungi do not need to pass through an animal in
order to complete their life cycle. They can grow, reproduce,
and survive without ever passing through living tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The current concept of the term "dimorphic" used by
medical mycologists is quite different than that expressed
within this book. This reviewer is unaware of anyone who
considers Cryptococcus neoformans, Chrysosporium parvum,
or Wangiella dermatitidis as dimorphic fungi in the same sense
as Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma
capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, or Penicillium
marneffei (p. 28, table 8). The clinical laboratory techniques
described are useful, but incomplete in several areas. It is
disappointing that the editors did not develop and then apply
criteria for distinguishing acceptable from unacceptable case
reports, especially for rare opportunistic pathogens.
Unfortunately, many readers of their book will assume that the
fungi included in the book associated with reported infections
are actual confirmed etiologic agents of infection. In reality,
many are not. For example, Absidia coerulea was cited as a
pulmonary pathogen, yet the editors state that it cannot grow
at human body temperature (p. 244). Overall, the book contains
a superb collection of line drawings and photomicrographs
that are not readily available. These illustrate the majority of
fungi of medical and veterinary interest. The medical
mycology portion of the text, however, contains numerous
problems and egregious errors that diminish the importance
of the book. Michael R. McGinnis, Center for Tropical Diseases

better feel for the tree and your data. It's the closest thing to a
phylogeny video game that | have seen." Joseph Felsenstein
(PHYLIP main documentation).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MacClade is an interactive Macintosh computer
program that lets you explore how characters evolve under
alternative phylogenetic hypotheses. Using MacClade, you
can draw a tree and then modify it, moving a taxon from one
place to another with a quick movement of a mouse. The
program uses parsimony to reconstruct character state
changes for each tree you draw. MacClade is designed for
rapid data entry. It accepts morphological and molecular
characters of several kinds and it allows you to define how
individual characters can evolve. Version 3.05 permits up to 10
continuous (non-integer) character states for each character.
The data matrix format encourages precise definition of
morphological characters and allows extensive annotations.
In addition to text, the matrix can include scanned pictures of
organisms, characters, or distribution maps. Comparing
pictures is inconvenient, however, because the program only
displays one picture at a time. As an alternative to writing a
file in MacClade, you can import a data matrix written in one
of several other formats or open a data matrix created with a
text or sequence editor. One caution though: When saving a
file created by another program, MacClade keeps only
"perfect" NEXUS file format and erases any other comments
and formatting.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unlike programs or packages such as PAUP, PHYLIP,
or Hennig86, MacClade is not designed to find all the most
parsimonious trees for a data set. Instead, MacClade works
cooperatively to analyze trees from other programs.
MacClade has an extensive charting ability for comparing
trees and character statistics and its clean graphical output
appears regularly in publications and seminar slides.
Constraint trees designed in MacClade can be used directly in
PAUP or exported for use with PHYLIP.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The MacClade program package includes a 398 page
book providing a clear explanation of phylogeny, parsimony
and character evolution. We recommend the phylogeny
section to our students as a coherent introduction to the field.
The book also outlines program capabilities that surprise and
delight us. For example, the program can perform
“stratigraphic parsimony," estimating minimum ages of
divergence from available fossil evidence.#Misc-exposition*]

(http://phylogeny.arizona.edu/macclade/macclade.html),

suggestions. A free version 3.05 updater for those who have
older versions of MacClade is available at the same site. A
demonstration program of MacClade ver. 3.05 is available by
gopher, FTP (fetch) or WWW at ftp.bio.indiana.edu. The three
alternatives to MacClade are less powerful and less user
friendly. Clados is a comparatively limited DOS based

suite of free programs and documentation for phylogenetic
analysis that will work on most types of computers. The
PHYLIP programs MOVE, DOLMOVE, and DNAMOVE
incorporate some of the branch swapping found in MacClade
and allow comparison of the costs of alternative hypotheses.
The third method requires a pencil, a ruler, and lots of paper
and erasers. Instead of blindly putting in characters and
accepting computer output, MacClade lets you explore
alternative phylogenies and their consequences. We strongly

history and practice of mycophagy world-wide, as well as
describe the diverse mechanisms of mushroom poisoning, and
their treatment. The author, a physician, is particularly
qualified to advise on the latter topic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book is divided into three major parts: 1)
Mushrooms and Health (100 pp.); 2) Mushroom Poisoning (71
pp.); and, 3) Mushroom Poisoning Syndromes (173 pp.). The
first part includes the ethnomycological and historical
material, as well as sections on health and nutritional aspects
of mushrooms. The chapters "Cultural Attitudes Toward
Mushrooms" and "History of Mushroom Eating and Mushroom
Poisoning" include numerous references to historical texts,
with liberal use of quotations. This section provides insight
into the origin of contemporary attitudes about mushrooms
and includes some of the most enjoyable passages in the book.
Although all cultures are surveyed, the treatment here is
decidedly eurocentric, which is understandable considering
the language barrier. Nevertheless, the medicinal use of
mushrooms in China, and the approximately 1400-year history
of their cultivation, deserved a better treatment. The second
part concerns the distribution and occurrence of toxic
mushrooms and the sociology of mushroom poisoning. Also
included here is the chapter, "Diagnosis and Management of
Mushroom Poisoning," which presents a condensed overview
of symptoms, prognosis, and treatment for the various types of
mushroom poisoning syndromes. This valuable chapter has
been printed on shaded pages for quick reference. The third,
and largest, part of the book treats each of the major
mushroom poisoning syndromes. For each, the responsible
fungi and their seasonal and spatial distributions are discussed,
along with critical reviews of what is known about the
mechanisms of toxicity. Specific recommendations for
treatment expand on the material in the chapter on "Diagnosis
and Management." These chapters synthesize a large body of
primary source literature; there are 137 references for the
chapter on "Amatoxin Syndrome" alone. This book includes
numerous anecdotal accounts of mushroom poisoning, many
from the authors own journal. These add a human perspective
and make the book more readable, but some clinicians may
find them superfluous. Lastly, there are four appendices,
which include an amusing juxtaposition of chemical formulas
for fungal toxins with a bibliography of mushroom cookbooks.#Misc-exposition*]
