[@Sanchez & Korf (1966) divided this genus into four sections,
Vibrissea, Leucovibrissea A. Sánchez, Apostemium (P. Karst.)
A. Sánchez & Korf, and Microstemium A. Sanchez & Korf,
emphasizing differences in apothecial color, presence or absence
of a stipe, paraphysis apices, and ascus and ascospore
measurements. They treated the generic names Apostemium
(P. Karst.) P. Karst. and Apostemidium P. Karst. as synonyms of
Vibrissea. Sanchez (1967) treated the sections Apostemium and
Microstemium, and gave descriptions of the known species.
The extensive synonymies he reported are not repeated here.
Nevertheless I have chosen to fully describe each species of the
Macaronesian Vibrisseas, from dried specimens. The four
known Macaronesian Vibrissea species all belong to section
Apostemium. More detailed information is given, and some
differences from Sánchez's descriptions are noted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The family Vibrisseaceae was recently erected (Korf, 1991) to
embrace the genera Vibrissea Fr. : Fr., Syst. mycol. 2(1): 31. 1822,
Chlorovibrissea L. M. Kohn, Mem. New York Bot. Gard. 49: 113.
1989, and Leucovibrissea (A. Sánchez) Korf, Mycosystema 3: 23.
1991, displaying frequent underwater discharge of their filiform
ascospores and adaptation of the ascospores for water dispersal.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Vibrissea is easily distinguished by its habitat, filiform to long
cylindrical ascospores, and disposition of the cells of the ectal
excipulum. But in order to key out the species, some structures
are difficult to observe and measure individually, such as long
cylindrical asci, paraphyses, and long filiform ascospores, since
they break easily. When working with specimens of this genus,
it is advisable to soak a thick (+100 µm) apothecial section in
water for a long time, and then gently separate the hymenial
tissues with the help of two insect pins. Only after this operation
a cover slip may be used, pressed gently with an eraser. Melzer's
Reagent or stains can be added later by placing a drop to one side
of the coverslip and drawing it through with a piece of filter
paper on the opposite side. Asci then may be individually seen
and measured, as well as paraphyses. Since frequently in this
genus ascospores break inside the ascus, often only pieces can be
measured. The term “perihymenial zone” is used as in Sánchez
& Korf (1966) to designate a layer lying above the medullary
excipulum, between the hymenium and the ectal excipulum at
the margin, J+ in Melzer’s Reagent, unstained in cotton blue,
and first noted by Nannfeldt (1932).#Misc-exposition*]

[@AGARICOSTILBUM NOVA-ZELANDICA, A NEW AURICULARIOID
FUNGUS ON RHOPALOSTYLIS SAPIDA FROM NEW ZEALAND#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bryce Kendrick
and
Xiandi Gong

Department of Biology, University of Waterloo,
Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, N2L 3G1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examining collections made by one of us in New Zealand, we found
an unusual fungus growing in a decaying inflorescence of the native palm,
Rhopalostylis sapida H. Wendl. & Drude, which exhibits some characters
that collectively do not appear to fit into any known genus: (1) long fertile
hyphae (often fasciculate toward the base), septate only in the apical and
basal regions, (2) a linear series of four (occasionally up to 7) integrated
sporogenous cells at the apex of each fertile hypha, (3) the development on
each fertile cell of a localized, swollen, initially hump-like but ultimately
vesicular structure producing a cluster of sporogenous loci each bearing a
non-septate spore. This structure, while apical on the terminal cell of the
fertile hypha, is lateral, always on the same side of, and positioned just
below the upper septum of, the sub-apical sporogenous cells (Figs. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This unusual suite of characters invites comparison with only one or
two known fungal genera, notably Agaricostilbum Wright (1970) [which was
emended by Subramanian and Natarajan (1977), and again by Wright,
Bandoni and Oberwinkler (1981)], and Microstroma Niessl (1861), although
species of both of these genera produce synnema-like aggregations, rather
than individual fertile hyphae. Nevertheless, in both genera the free upper
parts of the fertile hyphae clearly exhibit features (2) and (3) noted above.
This similarity between Agaricostilbum and Microstroma was briefly noted#Misc-exposition*]
[@20#Misc-exposition*]

[@by Carmichael et al. (1980) (who referred, however, to Amerobotryum
Subramanian et Natarajan, a synonym of Agaricostilbum). Atractiella
Saccardo : Saccardo (1886) is also similar to our fungus, but produces only
one spore from each fertile cell. Agaricostilbum and Atractiella were
originally described as conidial fungi (synnematal hyphomycetes), but are
now regarded as gasteroid or sequestrate basidiomycetes, and were placed in
a new order, Atractiellales, by Oberwinkler and Bandoni (1982). Later,
Oberwinkler and Bauer (1989), having accumulated a wider range of data on
Agaricostilbum, decided that it occupied a rather isolated position in the
basidiomycetes, and erected the new order Agaricostilbales for it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the meantime, the taxonomic position of Microstroma must be
regarded as uncertain, since it (like Atractiella and Agaricostilbum) was
described as a hyphomycete, but there seems to be a possibility that it, like
Agaricostilbum, may eventually be determined to be a basidiomycete.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a recent discussion of the taxonomy of synnematal hyphomycetes,
Seifert and Okada (1990) noted that although the production of synnemata
had been an extremely important character in the Saccardoan system of
classification, this feature was downgraded by Hughes (1953) and other
subsequent workers, who considered conidium ontogeny to be of much
greater importance. Seifert and Okada noted that several genera incorporate
both mononematous and synnematous species (e. g. Penicillium Link,
Aspergillus Micheli : Link, and Hirsutella Patouillard).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This led us to consider incorporating our new fungus in one of the
described genera, rather than erecting a new genus for it. Leaving aside the
issue of the possible synonymy between Agaricostilbum and Microstroma,
while noting that both genera have yeast-like growth phases (Carmichael et
al., 1980; Oberwinkler et al., 1982) we decided that our fungus resembled
the former more closely. This suggestion of relationship is reinforced by the
fact that our fungus and A. pulcherrimum (Berk. & Broome) Brady, Sutton
et Samson, the type species of Agaricostilbum, both occur on palm spathes
(Agaricostilbum pulcherrimum on Butia, Cocos and Phoenix [though also on
Xanthorrhoea sp: Liliaceae], and our new species on Rhopalostylis).
Microstroma has been found -on dead leaves of Juglans and Carya
(Juglandaceae).#Misc-exposition*]
[@21#Misc-exposition*]

[@These examples, and the overwhelming similarity between the
development and anatomy of the fertile cells of our fungus and those of
Agaricostilbum spp., led us to dispose our new species as the third species
of Agaricostilbum. The placement of our new species in Agaricostilbum
necessitates some further emendation of the generic diagnosis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@As indicated in the immediately preceding paper of this series (Khan,
Kamal and Morgan-Jones, 1993), surveys of foliicolous, anamorphic micro fungi
in Uttar Pradesh have led to the discovery of considerable numbers of
previously undescribed species. Collection on a wide range of hosts in the
forest areas surrounding and in the vicinity of Gorakhpur and Bahraich during
the past decade (Kamal et al., 1991; Khan et al.,1992) has resulted in the
description of new species of the following genera; Cercospora, Heteroconium,
Mycovellosiella, Phaeoisariopsis, Phaeoramularia, Pseudocercospora, Sarci-

[@Sirosporium dendropthoes belongs to a small group of species within
the genus which form diminutive or rudimentary stromata. These include S.
carissae Kapoor, S. celtidicola M.B. Ellis, S. gliricidiae (Syd.) Deighton, and
S. munduleae (H. & P. Syd.) M.B. Ellis. The stromata, where present in the
genus, are formed superficially, as in S. carissae, or partly immersed and
erumpent, often through stomata, as in S. celtidicola. Sirosporium
dendropthoes can readily be distinguished from these species by the morphology
of its conidia, which somewhat resemble those of such species as S. gliricidiae
(Syd.) Deighton and S. diffusum (Heald & Wolf) Deighton, but are more
variable in shape and septation. The conidia of S. dendropthoes are somewhat
variable in shape and form, in the manner of those of S. antenniforme (Berk. &
Curt.) Bubak & Serebrianikow, the type species of the genus. In these taxa the
conidia are either long-obclavate and phragmosporous or broad-obclavate and
dictyosporous, usually bearing one to several oblique or longitudinal septa. The
majority of Sirosporium species form their colonies hypophyllously with only a
few being amphigenous. Those having the latter characteristic are S.
dendropthoes, S. gliricidiae, and S. stylidii M.B. Ellis. No member of

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Mycocentrospora was established by Deighton (1972) to
accommodate four species, M. acerina (Hartig) Deighton, its type, M. asiminae
(Ell. & Kellerm.) Deighton, M. cantuariensis (Salmon & Wormald) Deighton and
M. mitragynae (Pavgi, Singh & Deighton) Deighton, originally classified in
either Centrospora Neergaard or Cercospora Fresen. The generic name
Centrospora, based on C. ohlsenii Neergaard, now considered a synonym of M.
acerina, was taken up earlier by Deighton (1971) for two of these taxa, although
it was then known to be a later homonym of Centrospora Trevisan, a brown
algae. The same author (Deighton, 1970) had previously proposed the
conservation of Centrospora Neergaard [1942] against Centrospora Trevisan
[1845] on the mistaken assumption that the latter, although validly published, had
been rejected. Silva (1972) subsequently offered reasons for retaining
Centrospora Trevisan, pointing out that Deighton (1970) had been incorrect in
his assumption. Deighton (1972) thus proposed Mycocentrospora as a new
name for Centrospora Neerg. and since that time an additional nine species and
one variety have been added to the genus. There is some uncertainty, however,
as to the total homogeneity of Mycocentrospora as presently constituted.#Misc-exposition*]
[@38#Misc-exposition*]

[@Petersen (1962a) named an aquatic hyphomycete on decaying leaves of an
unidentified species of Prunus L., Centrospora angulata Petersen. Although
being broadly similar in morphology and conidium ontogeny to Mycocentrospora
acerina, including presence of a basal conidial appendage, this fungus differs in
producing only a single terminal conidium and its conidiophores do not
proliferate sympodially. Another spore state, referred to as "secondary
phialospores", was encountered when C. angulata was grown invitro. These
microconidia are formed from Phialophora-like phialides. A similar state is
known to be produced by Anguillospora pseudolongissima (Ranzoni, 1953).
Petersen (1962b) added another aquatic hyphomycete to Centrospora when he
transferred Anguillospora filiformis Greathead to the genus. Ingold (1958) had
earlier offered the opinion that a similar fungus, which was originally thought
to be an Anguillospora (Ingold, 1949), was a species of Centrospora.
Centrospora filiformis (Greathead) Petersen also differs from typical
Mycocentrospora species in lacking conidiophore sympodial proliferation
(Greathead, 1961). Iqbal (1971) named yet another aquatic species of
Centrospora, C. aquatica Iqbal. The fungus was said to closely resemble C.
filiformis but differ from it in having smaller, narrower, tapering conidia.
Subsequently the same author (Iqbal, 1974) described Mycocentrospora clavata
Iqbal, found on decaying branches submerged in river water. This taxon is
more closely similar to M. acerina in that its conidiophores proliferate
sympodially at least once to give rise to a second conidium. In the same
publication the above d C. angulata, C. ica and C. filiformis were
all transferred to the genus Mycocentrospora as M. angulata (Petersen) Iqbal,
M. aquatica (Iqbal) Iqbal and M. filiformis (Greathead) Iqbal, respectively. A
superfluous combination, Mycocentrospora angulata [as ungulata] (Petersen)
1.A. Dudka, also exists [Ukr. bot. Zh. 49:61, 1983).#Misc-exposition*]



[@Deighton (1971) expressed the view that it was doubtful that either C.
angulata or C. filiformis was satisfactorily included in Centrospora but made
no proposal as to their reclassification. Wolfe (1976) agreed with this
contention and effectively reinstated the basionym Anguillospora filiformis as
the appropriate binomial for the fungus described by Greathead (1961).
Furthermore Wolfe (loc. cit.) proposed the new combination Anguillospora
angulata (Petersen) Wolfe but, failing to provide full particulars of the
publication of the basionym Centrospora angulata Petersen, the transfer was
invalid. Subsequently Redhead and White (1985) validly retransferred
Centrospora angulata into Anguillospora as A. angulata (Petersen) Redhead &
White. Neither Wolfe (loc. cit.) nor Redhead and White (loc. cit.) made
mention of the classification of the two fungi as species of Mycocentrospora
by Iqbal (1974). Two of the thirteen known species of Mycocentrospora are
thus now classified elsewhere. The status of Mycocentrospora aquatica
remains doubtful. Wolfe (loc. cit.) suggested that it too might be better
classified in Anguillospora but took no action in this regard. In so far that it
also lacks the sympodial conidiophore typical of M ycocentrospora, and bearing
in mind its similarity to A. filiformis, it would appear that a case could be made
to transfer it into Anguillospora.#Misc-exposition*]
[@39#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pollack and Ellett (1974) established the binomial Mycocentrospora
verrucosa Pollack & Ellett for a fungus causing brown lesions on living leaves
of Euonymus kiautschovica Loes. This species differs from those typical of
Mycocentrospora in possessing verrucose conidia and in having distinctly
geniculate, abundantly septate, appreciably pigmented conidiophores where the
majority of conidiogenous cells become intercalary. A reevaluation of its status
is perhaps warranted. It bears some similarity to species of Subulispora
Tubaki, such as S. africana (Morgan-Jones, Sinclair & Eicker) P.M. Kirk,
particularly in conidiophore morphology and coloration, and its conidia are
rostrate, tapering to a narrow apex. In the latter regard, however, it resembles
Mycocentrospora acerina and it also produces dark brown chlamydospore-like
cells as does that species. Conidia of S. procurvata Tubaki, the type species of
Subulispora, S. britannica Sutton and S. rectilineata Tubaki, are subulate
(Tubaki and Yokoyama, 1971; Sutton, 1973). Not all species of Subulispora
have, however, subulate conidia, S. africana, S. cylindrospora P.M. Kirk and
S. minima P.M. Kirk, being exceptions with cylindrical conidia (Kirk, 1985).
The latter, which has semi-macronematous, hyaline conidiophores might be
more appropriately classified in Mycocentrospora or possibly, together with
the other taxa possessing cylindrical conidia, in a new genus. Subulispora, as
has been the case with many dematiaceous hyphomycete genera, is now a
heterogeneous entity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A fungus originally named Cercospora cladosporioides Sacc. was
transferred into Mycocentrospora by Costa (1976) but the name
Mycocentrospora cladosporioides (Sacc.) P. Costa was not validly published
since full citation of the basionym was not provided. This was rectified by
Deighton (1983) who, in the same publication, named Mycocentrospora
camelliae Deighton based on specimens described by Laundon (1970) but
mistakenly identified as Cercoseptoria theae (Cav.) Curzi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sinclair and Morgan-Jones (1979) named Mycocentrospora varians
Sinclair & Morgan-Jones from unidentified decaying leaves submerged in a
stream. The conidiophores of this species do not proliferate sympodially to the
extent that those of M. acerina typically do, only one or, at most, two conidia
being produced per conidiophore. Therefore some question exists as to whether
or not it is satisfactorily classified in the genus. It bears some resemblance to
the former species of Mycocentrospora now classified in Anguillospora and to
A. longissima Ingold, the type species of that genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycocentrospora fusarioides Matsushima, isolated from dead rachis of
Alsophila spinulosa (Hook.) R. Tryon, a tree fern, in Taiwan (Matsushima,
1987) likewise may not be a true member of Mycocentrospora, although it has
some of the essential characteristics of the genus. Two species of
Centrospora named by Matsushima (1975) belong in other genera. Centrospora
éracilis Matsushima was transferred as Subulispora gracilis (Mats.) de Hoog
(de Hoog, 1985) while C. helminthosporioides Matsushima remains to be
satisfactorily disposed. The latter, collected on dead leaves of Podocarpus
macrophyllus (Thunb.) D. Don, has some of the characteristics of
Mycocentrospora but undoubtedly should be classified elsewhere, perhaps in a#Misc-exposition*]
[@40#Misc-exposition*]

[@new genus. Its conidia are quite different from those of Mycocentrospora,
being similar to those of Vermispora obclavata Vasant Rao & de Hoog (Rao and
de Hoog, 1986). An unnamed Centrospora described and illustrated by
Matsushima (loc. cit.) appears quite similar to Subulispora minima.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tribe and Cayrol (1982) named a variety of Mycocentrospora acerina,
var. castelnaudariensis Tribe & Cayrol, encountered within cysts of the
nematode Heterodera avenae Wollenw. It differs from the species in producing
microsclerotia in vitro.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus known as Mycocentrospora asiminae, one of the four
species included in the genus by Deighton (1972) when it was established, has
been reclassified as Miuraea asiminae (Ell. & Morgan) Arx & Constantinescu
(von Arx, 1983). This action was presumably taken because of the occasional
presence of a longitudinal or oblique septum, in addition to transverse septa, in
conidia of M. asiminae. Phloeospora asiminae Ell. & Morgan [J. Mycol. 3:88,
1887] and Cercospora asiminae Ell. & Kellerm. [J. Mycol. 3:103, 1887] were
considered to be synonyms by von Arx (loc. cit.), hence the different author
citation to that of Deighton (loc. cit.). The question of whether M. asiminae is
best classified in Miuraea or Mycocentrospora is beyond the scope of the
present paper but it is included in the key to the latter. The genus
Rhopaloconidium Petrak (Petrak, 1952) has as its type species R. asiminae
(Ell. & Morgan) Petrak. Should this species still be considered a good
Mycocentrospora some further nomenclatural changes would be required since
Rhopaloconidium predates M ycocentrospora by twenty years.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The remaining species of Mycocentrospora, M. veratri (Peck) U.
Braun, was added to the genus by Braun (1991). It had originally been classified
in Cercosporella, as C. veratri Peck. This taxon has rostrate conidia,
similarly shaped to those of C. acerina. The circumscription of
Mycocentrospora remains to be definitively decided but appears to be best
restricted to plant pathogenic species bearing semi-macronematous
conidiophores, often arranged in fascicles.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In recent years Braun (1988, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1994) has reevaluated
the taxonomy and nomenclature of a range of foliicolous, phytopathogenic
hyphomycetes, describing many new species and reclassifying others. During
the course of this work generic concepts were reviewed and changes made
based on more precise circumscription of a number of taxa, particularly
Ramularia Unger and related genera. The genus Ramularia has had a rather
complex history and several concepts have been advanced with the result that its
application and delimitation have, over the years, been unstable. Not only that,
its typification has been the subject of differing opinions. Clements and Shear
(1931) proposed that Ramularia urticae Ces. be considered its type species,
rather than one of the two original species, R. pusilla Unger and R. didyma
Unger (Unger, 1833). "Von Arx (1970, 1983) chose R. didyma as the type
species but Braun (1988) proposed the lectotypification of R. pusilla and its
recognition as the type species according to the intention of Unger (1836), which
was followed by Corda (1842). A broad concept of Ramularia is now favored
by Braun (1990b), with taxa previously classified in such separate genera as
Acrotheca Fuckel, Didymaria Corda, Ophiocladium Cav., Ovularia Sacc.,
Pseudovularia Speg., Septocylindrium Bon. ex Sacc., and Tretovularia#Misc-exposition*]
[@50#Misc-exposition*]

[@Deighton included within it. The genus Didymaria was based on R. didyma.
The main distinction between Ovularia and Ramularia lies in the lack of
conidium septation in the former, conidial shape and presence or absence of
catenation. Initially Ovularia was limited to taxa bearing ovoid conidia, produced
solitarily (Saccardo, 1880) but later species with conidia borne in chains were
also accommodated in the genus (Saccardo, 1886). A range of intermediates
exist between Ramularia and Ovularia (Hughes, 1949; Braun, 1988; Sutton and
Waller, 1988), hence the two are now amalgamated.#Misc-exposition*]

were encountered. They are described and illustrated herein.#Misc-exposition*]

FIGURE 2. Ramularia triumfettae. Superficial hyphae, conidiophores and
conidia.#Figure*]
[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both R. cissampeloides and R. triumfettae belong to a group of species,
characterized by lack of stromata, that produce their conidiophores solitarily
from Sees hyphae rather than in fascicles. In this regard they bear
resemblance to species of Mycovellosiella Rangel but differ from taxa
classified in that genus by having hyaline conidiophores and conidia. Braun
(1990a) discussed the relationship of various Ramularia-like hyphomycetes,
bearing extensive external secondary mycelium and conidiophores arising as
terminal or lateral branches of superficial hyphae, with similar pigmented
species of Mycovellosiella. Braun (1988) had previously not included such taxa
in his revised concept of Ramularia although other authors, such as von Arx
(1983) made provision for these entities within their circumscriptions of the
genus. Deighton (1974, 1979), in contrast, reclassified some Ramularia species
bearing superficial hyphae in Mycovellosiella. Arguments were presented by
Braun (1990a) for the inclusion of hyaline Mycovellosiella-like species in
Ramularia. The notion of establishing a new genus to accommodate such fungi
was considered to be untenable and the view expressed that possession of
superficial hyphae was insufficient reason for segregation from Ramularia.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Braun (1990a) listed eight species as belonging to this complex, namely
R. cardui-personatae Hohn., R. maclurae (Ell. & Langl.) U. Braun, R.
malvastri Linder, R. oryzae Deighton & Shaw, R. paspali (Deighton) U. Braun,
R. phaseoli (Drum.) Deighton, R. sidae Olive, and R. sidarum Petr. & Syd.
Of these, excepting R. cardui-personatae and R. maclurae, six had been
classified previously by Deighton (loc. cit.) in Mycovellosiella. These hyaline
species are essentially intermediate forms between Mycovellosiella and
Ramularia but the superficial hyphae are not necessarily considered the
equivalent of those of the former genus, even though there is little to distinguish
them morphologically. In conidiophore structure, and in conidiophore and
conidial scar characteristics, these taxa are typical members of Ramularia.
The generic concept adopted by Braun (1990a, 1990b) is accepted herein.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some other species of Ramularia, such as R. grewiae Lacy &
Thirumalachar and R. gymnematis Ramakrishnan & Sundaram, do not produce
stromata and bear solitary, superficial conidiophores (Thirumalachar and Lacy,
1951; Ramakrishnan and Sundaram, 1954). These species resemble those
mentioned by Braun (1990a) and those described in this paper. Another similar
species, R. piperis P. Henn., was transferred into Mycovellosiella as M.
piperis (P. Henn.) U. Braun on account of its having faintly pigmented
conidiophores and conidia (Braun, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two species described in this paper appear to differ in a number of
respects from those previously described, in addition to having separate host
family distinction. Morphologically they are similar to R. cardui-personatae
and R. gymnematis but can be distinguished from these species by conidiophore
and conidial size, as well as degree of septation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unfortunately Dennis (1956) transferred Fuckel's epi-
thet, and did not adopt a much older epithet known to him.
In his discussion of C. monilifera, Dennis has a rather long
series of comments on Pezíza pallescene Pers. He noted that
Persoon (1799) had merely renamed Peziza lenticularis Hoff-
man (1795), which "is clearly the fungus which has commonly
been called Helotium moniliferum." Dennis did not adopt
"the epithet palleecene Pers., however, because the fungus
preserved under that name in Persoon's herbarium (No.
910.261-396.90 O.H.) is something quite different."#Misc-exposition*]

[@We agree that Hoffman's figure is unmistakably the same
fungus that Fuckel described. We also agree that Persoon
(1799) did not erect a new species, but only provided a new
name for P. lenticularie Hoffm., which he cited as a synonym
of his new name, P. palleecene. He was avoiding homonymy
with the next species he described, P. lenticularis Bull.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We hold, therefore, that one should first search for a Hoff-
man specimen to typify the species which Persoon renamed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since Hughes (1958) noted that he had examined the type
specimen of Dematium antennaeforme Hoffm. (the conidial fun-
gus illustrated as accompanying P. Zenticularis Hoffm.), we
obtained the two Hoffman specimens under this name from the
Berlin Botanisches Museum to see if there were any apothecia
present, or if there was material filed there under P. len-
ticularis. No material was discovered there under the Dis-
comycete name, and the two packets we did examine of Hoff-
man's Dematium are unfortunately devoid of apothecia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We next turned to the Persoon herbarium, at Leiden.
Merely because a specimen is present there does not auto-
matically make such a specimen a Persoon type, however,
since we are informed by Dr. R. A. Maas Geesteranus of the
Leiden Rijksherbarium that many of the collections there re-
present material collected late in Persoon's career, during
his stay at Paris. The specimen referred to by Dennis had
apparently been erroneously placed in the cover of Peziza
Llenticularis Bulliard [sic]. It bears the label: "Pesisa ?
Lenticularis Hoffm. — pallescens. Syn. pl." but bears no
date or indication of when or where it may have been collect-
ed. We agree with Dennis's conclusion that this specimen
does not represent the fungus illustrated by Hoffman, nor
the fungus described by Persoon and by Fuckel.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second collection in the Persoon herbarium at Leiden,
No. 910.256-842.90 O.H., is, however, most significant. It
is labelled: "Pesisa pailescens P., Junghuhn leg. — German-
ia," and contains apothecia and the Bispora conidial fungus
of the type illustrated by Hoffman and described by Fuckel.
This specimen was apparently not seen by Dennis, as no anno-
tation slip of his accompanies it. Though it may represent
the actual material Persoon had in hand in 1799, there is no
date associated with it either. We hereby designate this
specimen as the neotype specimen of Peziza pallescens Pers.
It agrees in all respects with the type specimen of Biepora
monilifera Fuckel, on deposit at the Conservatoire et Jardin
Botanique in Geneva, which we have also examined.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The generic name Phaeoramularia Muntafiola was established for four
species, two of which had previously been classified in Cercospora Fres., and
two described as new (Muntafiola, 1960). The type species, Phaeoramularia
gomphrenicola (Speg.) Muntafiola, a fungus occurring on living leaves of
Gomphrena glauca (Spreng.) Moq. [= Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pederson] in
Argentina, had originally been named Cercospora gomphrenicola Speg.
(Spegazzini, 1882). The second species transferred from Cercospora,
Phaeoramularia unamunoi (Castellani) Muntafiola [= Cercospora unamunoi
Castellani], is now considered a synonym of Phaeoramularia capsicicola
(Vassiljevsky) Deighton [s Cercospora capsicicola Vassiljevsky] (Deighton,
1976; Ellis, 1976). The binomial Phaeoramularia unamunoi was not, in fact,
validly published since Muntanola (loc. cit.) failed to cite details of basionym
publication. Sutton (1970) added Phaeoramularia maculicola (Rom. & Sacc.)
Sutton [= Torula maculicola Rom. & Sacc.] to the genus, followed by Marasas
and Bredell (1974) and Matsushima (1975) who named new species; P.
kellermania Marasas & Bredell and P. hachijoensis Matsushima, respectively.#Misc-exposition*]
[@58#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phaeoramularia remained, however, a relatively small genus for well
over a decade after its establishment until twenty one additional species were
added (Ellis, 1976), all but one authored, as new combinations, by F.C. Deighton
and all but three previously classified, at one time or other, in Cercospora.
Since then a plethora of taxa have been included in the genus by many authors. It
now contains in total, to our knowledge, seventy-four species, not including
those described herein. Of these, thirty-two were at first classified in
Cercospora. Others were originally placed in such genera as Fusicladium
Link, Passalora Fr., Ragnhildiana Solheim [= Mycovellosiella Deighton],
Selenosporium Corda [= Fusarium Link : Fr.], Septocylindrium Bon.,
Septosporium Corda, as well as two in Torula Pers. : Fr. Since its inception
thirty-one new species have been described in the genus. Authors who have
added several further species include Deighton (1979), Liu and Guo (1982) and,
more recently, Braun (1992, 1993) and Braun and Rogerson (1993). Most
species of Phaeoramularia, as is the case with those of other genera of the
large Cercospora-complex, are closely similar to each other, being
distinguished only by a combination of small morphological distinctions,
conidiophore and conidial size differentials, and host relationships. Although
some doubt can perhaps be cast on the validity of a partly host-based
classification most, if not all, of the species currently recognized seem to be
distinct and separate entities. If and when the genus is monographed it seems
possible that some synonymies may, however, become evident.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phaeoramularia is rather close to Cladosporium Link:Fr., both, together
with a number of other similar genera, being anamorphs of Mycosphaerella
Johans. (von Arx, 1983). They differ in that the conidiophores of the former
are not, in general, macronematous to the extent that those of most species of
Cladosporium are and have a less well-defined fertile region. Those of
Phaeoramularia usually arise from distinct, pseudoparenchymatous stromata
produced in leaf substomatal cavities and, as a result, are arranged in dense
fascicles rather than mostly solitarily as they tend to be in Cladosporium.
Although idium production and idiophore and conidial scar characteristics
are essentially identical in the two genera the conidia of Phaeoramularia are
different in being much longer and slenderer, although there are a few
exceptions. As discussed by Deighton (1979), some overlapping is found among
many genera of this complex, each being distinguished on the basis of only one
or at most a few characters which appear to be constant.#Misc-exposition*]



[@A number of species of Phaeoramularia have been described or recorded
from the Indian subcontinent (Dublish and Singh, 1977; Patil and Thife, 1977;
Kumar and Kamal, 1980; Gupta et a/., 1981; Mukerji et al., 1983; Kamal and

1990; Mehrotra and Verma, 1991; Rao and Yadav, 1991). During the past two
decades fourteen new species, causing leaf spot symptoms on a variety of host
plants, have been described from the region. In the present paper three further
novel taxa are described and illustrated based on collections made in Nepal from
November 1993 to January 1994.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]
[@Mycocentrospora veratri (Peck) U. Braun is redescribed and illustrated
from its type material.#Abstract*]
[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the course of studying and describing two novel species of
Mycocentrospora Deighton collected in India (Srivastava et al., 1995) occasion
arose to review the status of a number of taxa currently classified within it,
from both a taxonomic and nomenclatural perspective. In the process it became
apparent that the genus remains somewhat heterogeneous and a reevaluation of
several of its taxa is desirable. Braun (1993) reached the same conclusion and
excluded all but three species from the genus. Several taxa classified in the
genus by Deighton (1972, 1983) were transferred into Pseudocercospora Speg.,
while the reclassification of others was left in abeyance. As a contribution to
our knowledge of fungi accommodated in Mycocentrospora several species
have been investigated and will be reported upon in this series of papers. One
is treated herein.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus presently classified as Mycocentrospora veratri was
originally described under the name Cercosporella veratri Peck (Peck, 1891),
based on a collection made on Veratrum viride Aiton in the state of New York.
The published type description of it reads as follows; "Spots suborbicular or
elliptical, blackish, slightly frosted by the epiphyllous subfusiform, mostly
triseptate colorless spores, which terminate at one end in a long slender
tapering almost hair-like point; hyphae very short, almost obsolete; spores .002
to .004 in. long, .00016 to .0002 broad in the widest part. Languishing leaves of
Indian poke, Veratrum viride. Morehouseville. July.". Leaf spots and conidia
were figured but not conidiophores. Interestingly, in the same publication,
conidiophores, referred to as hyphae bearing spores, of two species of
Ramularia, R. graminicola Peck and R. destruens Peck, were illustrated,
perhaps indicating that Peck had some difficulty observing those of C. veratri.#Misc-exposition*]
[@68#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is mentioned because a similar experience seems to have also befallen
several subsequent authors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A year later, Allescher (1892) independently blished the bi ial
Fusoma veratri Allesch. for a fungus occurring on wilted leaves of Veratrum
lobelianum Bernh. [Veratrum album L.], collected at Oberammergau, Bavaria.
A translation of the German description of it reads as follows; "Sorus on leaf
surface spreading, whitish, almost round or longish, indeterminate, 2-3mm
diam; Conidia like a bundle combined, sickle-shaped bent, almost fusiform,
distichous, the upper cell narrowing upwards, acute rostrate, the lower cell
gradually thickened downwards, at the end a little narrower, with a septum,
either notor slightly constricted, hyaline, 30-40 X 3-5". A footnote was added
stating that the fungus formed white, small, 1-3mm in size, mostly round,
crumbly, effuse colonies on the leaf surface and might be closely related to
Fusoma farina (Schw.) Sacc. [8 Fusidium farina Schw. (Schweinitz, 1834)].
The genus Fusoma Corda (Corda, 1837), with two original species, F.
helmisporii Corda and F. ochraceum Corda is now considered as a nomen
dubium (Carmichael et al., 1980). Hughes (1958), in the absence of type or
authenticated material, could not establish the identity of either of these taxa. A
third species added to the genus by Corda (1838), Fusoma tetracoilum Corda, is
now classified as Septonema tetracoilum (Corda) Hughes. In any case, F.
veratri has been considered a facultative synonym of M. veratri by some
authors (Ondfej, 1974; Braun, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ellis and Everhart (1894) described a fungus causing spots on leaves of
Veratrum californicum E.M. Durant in Pullman, Washington, under the name
Marsonia veratri Ell. & Everh. It was given the following description; "Spots
amphigenous, small (2-3 mm.), whitish, with a broad, dull-purple border, which
is often elongated in the direction of the veins of the leaf for 2-3 cm., with the
ends acute, finally more or less confluent, the entire leaf becoming brown and
dead. Acervuli small, occupying the centre of the spots, or irregularly scattered
over them. Conidia clavate-cylindrical, curved, upper end subtruncate, lower
end attenuated and subacute, uniseptate, hyaline, 18-22 X 3-3.5 µm.".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Schroeter (1897) transferred Cercosporella veratri into the genus
Septocylindrium Bonorden ex Sacc., whose type species is S. septatum
(Bonorden) Lindau, a fungus with catenate conidia, described as a hyaline
counterpart of Septonema secedens Corda (Lindau, 1907). A new combination
based on Fusoma veratri was also made when Wollenweber (1917) established
the name Septogloeum veratri (Allesch.) Wollenw. A further synonym,
Gloeosporium veratri (Allesch.) Hóhn., also exists [see nomenclator below].
The combination Fusarium veratri (Allesch.) Hóhn. was mentioned by
Wollenweber (loc.cit.) but we are unaware of this ever having been formally
published and assume that it was merely a herbarium designation. Moesz (1930)
repeated the recombination made earlier by Wollenweber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Savile (1961) reported a "trace" of M. veratri [as Cercosporella
veratri] occurring with Puccinia veratra Duby on Veratrum eschscholtzii A.
Gray [Veratrum album] in British Columbia, Canada. A brief description was
provided in which the conidia were reported to measure 57-86(-94) X 2.2-3.2 µm
with 3-8(-10) septa. Conidiophores were said to be generally less than 20 µm
long but no further details were given. Examination of an isotype specimen in#Misc-exposition*]
[@69#Misc-exposition*]

[@the herbarium of John Dearness housed at DAOM revealed the conidia of that
material to be up to 74 µm long and4 µm wide, with 3-4 septa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In his revision of the genus Gloeosporium Desm. & Mont., in which the
more than seven hundred binomials existing within it were considered, von Arx
(1970) made the comment that Gloeosporium veratri needed further
investigation. In addition to its obligate synonyms, Fusoma veratri [the
basionym] and Septogloeum veratri, the facultative synonyms Marsonia veratri
and Marssonina veratri were included, with the remark that none of these
generic names seemed to be correct for the fungus. Petrak (1937) had earlier
listed Marsonia veratri as a synonym of G. veratri. As recent as a few years
ago, however, the name Gloeosporium veratri was still accepted and n
circulation, with Marsonia veratri listed as a synonym (Farr et al., 1989).
the same publication the binomial Cercosporella veratri remained in use, in
the prior name change to Centrospora veratri, and was treated separately from
Gloeosporium veratri, presumably on the continuing assumption that the two
names are based on different fungi. We thus have a current situation where
some authors (Ondrej, 1974; Braun, 1991) treat Fusoma veratri as a synonym of
Mycocentrospora veratri, whereas others (von Arx, 1970; Farr et al., 1989)
maintain it separately, in the form of Gloeosporium veratri. No mention of the
obligate synonyms of F. veratri was, incidentally, made by either Ondfej (loc.
cit.) or Braun (loc. cit.). Neither, apparently, were these authors aware of the
existence of the name Marsonia veratri and its obligate synonym Marssonina
veratri and their possible synonomy with Fusoma veratri and, therefore, with
Mycocentrospora veratri.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ondfej (1974) described and illustrated Cercosporella veratri based on a
number of collections made on Veratrum album ssp. lobelianum (Bernh.) Rchb.
in the then Czechoslovakia (including material from Cechy [Bohemia], Moravia,
and Slovakia). The new combination Centrospora veratri (Peck) Ondiej was
proposed. Specimens cited included ones upon which previously reported
records of the fungus from the region were based (Baudys, 1924; Baudy$ and
Picbauer, 1923; Picbauer, 1941, 1956). Leaf lesions were said to be ellipsoid or
round, white, 1-4mm in diameter. On older leaves colonies appeared white,
effuse and powdery. Conidiophores were described as hyaline, short, 3-4 X
3 µm in size. No sympodial conidiophore proliferation was reported or figured.
In the drawing provided conidiophores are shown as short, stubby, more or less
isodiametric cells borne laterally on hyphae. Conidia were reported to be two-
celled, 15-30(40) X 3-4 µm, four- to five-celled, 30-50 X 3-5 µm, or seven-
celled, 50-100 X 3-5.5 µm, sometimes bearing a basal appendage, 3-5 X lpm. It
was noted that, at a young stage, two-celled Marssonina-like conidia were
produced. Baudys (1924) had also reported two-celled, as well as three-celled,
conidia, the latter being 5µm in length.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Braun (1991) reclassified Cercosporella veratri in M ycocentrospora, as
M. veratri, and provided a very brief description of it as follows;
"Conidiophores solitary, ca. 5-20 X 3-7 µm, hyaline, + geniculate, aseptate,
conidial scars flat, broad, unthickened, conidia formed singly, ca. 30-70 X 3-
Tum, rostrate, obclavate, hyaline, smooth, multiseptate, base truncate ca. 2-3 µm
wide.". The conidiophores figured were cylindrical in shape.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to resolve the nomenclatural confusion surrounding this fungus
the type specimens on which the names [basionyms] Cercosporella veratri and
Marsonia veratri are based have been examined. In addition, the original
collection of Fusidium farina has been studied. It has not been possible to
examine the type material of Fusoma veratri.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type material of Fusoma veratri Allescher could not be located in the
herbarium of the Botanische Staatssammlung Miinchen but it is reasonably
certain from the original description that this name was based upon a collection
of Mycocentrospora veratri and is thus listed as a synonym in the above
nomenclator. A study of the type specimen of Marsonia veratri [Proc. Acad.
Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 337, 1894 = Marssonina veratri (Ell. & Everh.) Magnus,
Hedwigia 45:91, 1906] reveals that this is an entirely different fungus. Petrak
(1937) and von Arx (1970) were therefore incorrect in listing M. veratri as a
synonym of Fusoma veratri [as Gloeosporium veratri]. Marssonina veratri is
not, however, satisfactorily classified in Marssonina Magnus and should be
transferred to the genus Colletogloeum Petrak. This will be treated in a
separate publication. The identity of Fusidium farina Schw. is difficult to
establish from a study of its type specimen [collected at Salem, North Carolina.
Schweinitz Herbarium:Syn. fung. Am. bor. no. 2994] which consists of a piece
of bark bearing a lichen-like, crustose, whitish, farinaceous growth. No
fusiform, septate conidia, mentioned in the original description, were observed,
It is highly unlikely that this bears any relationship to the fungus described in
this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycocentrospora veratri, although having conidiophores that are rather
different in morphology from those of M. acerina (Hartig) Deighton, the type
species of M ycocentrospora, seems satisfactorily classified in the genus. Its
conidia are similar to those of M. acerina and it produces swollen hyphal cells
but these are not pigmented as in that species. The discrepancies in the
accounts and illustrations of the conidiogenous cells of M. veratri in the
literature have possibly occurred because of their small size and the fact that
they are difficult to observe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction: Fungal species with pigmented dictyospores that have been
reported from the Agavaceae (2, 4, 5, 10, 12) include Camarosporium
yuccaesedum Fairm., Montagnula infernalis (Niessl) Berl., M. phragmospora
(Durieu & Mont.) Crivelli, M. thumeniana (Sacc.) Crivelli, M. bataanensis (Petr.)
Crivelli, Pleospora agavicola Sivan., P. ellisii Wehm., and Teichospora aridophila
Peck. Synonymy for the Loculoascomycete species may be found in Barr (2),
Sivanesan (10), and Wehmeyer (12). Recent collections of members of the
Agavaceae in the southwestern United States contain several fungi with
pigmented dictyospores that belong to none of these taxa, necessitating
establishment of a new genus and several new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials and Methods: Teleomorphs were connected to their anamorphs by

comparison of cult and the conidi produced in the cultures from suspected
phases of a holomorph. Conidia were spread on potato dextrose agar (PDA)
and single spore isolates were subcultured on PDA. Single asci were washed
three times in sterile tap water and placed on PDA. Axenic subcultures were
grown on PDA. All cultures were grown at room temperature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascomata of Pleoseptum approach several species of Chaetoplea in shape, but
have thick-walled, dark cells in the peridium, more like those in Leptosphaeria.
Like L. maculans (Desm.) Ces. & De Not. and L. millefolii (Fuckel) Niessl (7), P.
yuccigena has a Camarosporium anamorph, but the dictyosporous ascospores
separate it from the phragmosporous species of Leptosphaeria. Pleoseptum
cannot be assigned to Heptameria, whose fusoid ascospores are transversely
septate at both ends and dictyosporous only in the mid-region, and whose
anamorph is a coelomycete with hyaline, aseptate conidia. Pleoseptum can also
be distinguished from Curreya, whose ascomata have a rounded apex and are
occasionally connected in a smal] stroma. The anamorph for Curreya, by
association, is a Coniothyrium-like coelomycete. The wall ornamentation of
Pleoseptum ascospores, foveolae in linear rows, is similar to that in the flattened
ascospores of Platysporoides vulgaris (Wehm.) Shoemaker & C. E. Babc. (9) and
in the terete ascospores of Pleospora discors (Durieu & Mont.) Ces. & DeNot.
(8); ascoma shape, peridium structure, and the anamorph all separate P.
yuccaesedum from these species.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Ascomata of Pleoseptum yuccaesedum and conidiomata of Camarosporium yuccae-
sedum (Fig. 1, D) are structurally similar, and only reliably identified by their
contents. Both structures characteristically have a rounded bottom with the
wall extending upward from the equator and flattened against the host epider-
mis. Cells in the wall are also similar in size and color. Ascomata and conidio-
mata may be in separate spots or even adjacent in the same spot. The lineolate
ornamentation (Fig. 1, F) of ascospores is indistinguishable from that of
conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Montagnula in North America is represented by species (2) confined to leaf
tissues of large monocots. These species have ascospores with a maximum
length of 30 µm (2). Montagnula phragmospora was recently collected on dead
leaves of Agave neomexicana Wooten & Standley (U. S. A. TEXAS: Brewster
County, off U. S. Hwy. 385, along road to Chisos Mountain Basin, 22 May
1993, Annette Ramaley 9313, BPI 802373. This is the first recorded collection
of M. phragmospora on Agave in the United States; it has been reported from
species of Yucca. The ascospores measured 27.2-32 x 12-16 µm, somewhat
larger than previously reported for this species (21-30 x 10-14), but showing the
same insertion of A2 septa close to the Al septum. Three new species of
Montagnula must be described, two of them with ascospores consistently longer
than 35 µm. Montagnula dasylirionis has dark clypeal tissue over a single oblong
ascoma or joined over adjacent ascomata. The large, obovoid to fusoid
ascospores may have an apical apiculus. — M. mohavensis also has large
ascospores, but the apiculus, when present, is at the base. The loose, dark
clypeus supertends a single globose to spheroid ascoma which may be much
larger than the ascomata of M. dasylirionis. Only the largest ascospores of M.
yuccigena overlap the length of the smallest ascospores of M. mohavensis, but
ascospore shape is the same in these two species. The clypeus for M. yuccigena
may be nonexistent. The apex of the dark ascomatal wall is associated with the
host epidermis, and dark hyphae radiate from its surface as they do over the
rest of the peridium. Alternatively, a clypeus may be present as a loose, dark
weft of hyphae between the upper part of the ascoma and the host epidermis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The clypeus of Chaetoplea rosipapilla, obvious over a young ascoma, consists of
loosely woven brown hyphae on the underside of the host epidermis. During

Ascospore size, shape, and longitudinal septation are extremely variable from
one ascoma to another, or even within the same ascoma. When the end cells
are undivided, the ascospores are more or less ellipsoid or slightly obovate.
When both end cells are divided the ascospores may be nearly rectangular (Fig.

slightly compressed ascospores, and the aged substrate suggest this species is

[@Conidiomata of Camarosporium agavifoliorum often occur singly or in small
groups on old stromata of a Piptarthron species. These conidiomata generally
have few hyphae extending from the wall and are sometimes irregularly shaped.
As in other Camarosporium species, old conidiomata often form aberrant
conidia, at times considerably larger (20-24 x 8-10 µm) and with more septa (5-
6-7) than in young ta with active conidi is in progress.#Misc-exposition*]

[@E#Misc-exposition*]



[@The Camarosporium species described here illustrate the heterogeneous nature of
the genus. The conidiogenous cells of C. agavifoliorum are ‘phialides,’ amd those
of C. yuccaesedum, C. nolinae, and C. agavensis may, apparently, be ‘annellides’
or ‘phialides’ or both. The two sorts of conidiogenous cells differ only in the
level at which additional conidia secede from the apex (6), but the difference
has been one basis for separating whole groups of fungi (8), and subdividing
large, heterogeneous taxa. It may not prove convenient for dividing Camaro-
sporium into additional genera. The variation shown for C. yuccaesedum, C.
agavensis, and C. nolinae conidiogenous cells is not present in each conidioma,
nor has it been observed in all collections of C. agavensis. As additional
conidiomata or further collections of C. agavifoliorum are examined, the presence
of ‘annellides’ would not be too surprising. Since potential for variation of the
level of conidial secession from the conidiogenous cell is clearly present in these
Camarosporium species, a classification in which ‘annellide’ or ‘phialide’ is used
in an exclusive manner, when only a few conidiomata or a single collection is
examined, would seem inadvisable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Müller (1952) synonymized Sphaeria carduorum with Ophiobolus
acuminatus. We concur with his disposition. The fungus studied here is
identical to Ophiobolus acuminatus except for two differences. The asci are
much smaller than those given for O. acuminatus (Walker, 1980: 130-150 x
10-12 µm; Shoemaker, 1976: 150-190 x 13-17 µm). Also, in the holotype of S.
carduorum, the part-spore has a swollen cell at the point of disarticulation
whereas in O. acuminatus the second or third cell from the point of
disarticulation is swollen. It is likely that the asci in the holotype material
are not fully mature and hence are smaller, and that additional septa are
laid down in the ascospore so that the swollen cell becomes the second cell
from the primary septum. This is shown in an illustration by Walker (1980,
Fig. 24).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This fungus on Chrysanthemum was considered to be a variety of L.
agnita by Berlese (1886). This taxon, however, differs from L. agnita in that
the ascomal wall in surface view is of textura prismatica, composed of cells
radiating from the ascomal apex outward and the ascospores are
consistently 5 septate. The ascomal wall in L. agnita is of textura angularis
in surface view, and the ascospores are 6 septate. We feel that these
differences are significant enough to remove this taxon from L. agnita and
propose the name Leptosphaeria chr hemicola to accommodate this
fungus. The variety name chrysanthemi was not used because it had been
applied previously to another fungus, L. chrysanthemi Clements &
Clements, and although it is a nomen nudum (Crane & Shearer, 1991), we
elected to use another name to avoid confusion. Leptosphaeria
chrysanthemicola is similar to L. ogilviensis, which also has 5 septate
ascospores, but can be distinguished from the latter by the absence of globose#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species was considered by Walker (1980) to be identical to L.
compressa. Although measurements of the ascomata, asci and ascospores
are similar in the two, morphological differences in the ascospores indicate
that they are distinct. In Shoemaker’s (1976) treatment of Ophiobolus
compressus, illustrations and a photograph of the spores show a constricted
rimary septum with no constriction at most other septa, and enlargement
of the cells immediately adjacent to the primary septum. Also, the cells of
the ascospores are significantly longer than wide. Our examination of the
isotype of O. compressus (Ascomyceten, Fascicle 4, No. 189, ex NY) confirms
these observations. In the holotype of Exilispora plurisepta, constrictions
were seen at many septa, no enlarged cells were observed, and the length to
width ratio was much smaller than in Shoemaker's illustrations of O.
compressus. The thick walled ascomata of L. plurisepta with polygonal,
scleroplectenchymatic cells is very characteristic of Leptosphaeria and
further distinguishes L. plurisepta from O. compressus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In connection with a latitudinal survey of the freshwater ascomycetes of North
America, a fungus with the generic characteristics of Coniochaeta was found. A
subsequent literature review of the species in Coniochaeta, including two recent keys
(Hawksworth & Yip, 1981; Mahoney & La Favre, 1981), revealed that this fungus has
not been described previously. A description of the new species follows.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascomata produced on incubated woody debris were fixed in
glutaraldehyde, embedded in Ultra Low Viscosity Resin and sectioned for light
microscopy (Huhndorf, 1991) at about 3 µm thickness. Sections were stained with
Toluidine Blue and preserved permanently on microscope slides in a 1:1 Permount-
xylene mix. Ascospores were prepared for SEM by air drying and mounting them on
stubs and then coating them with gold and palladium. Squash mounts of the ascomata
were made in water which was replaced with lactic acid containing Azure A.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new species of Pleospora with two varieties and
four species of Teichospora occurring in Xinjiang,
China are presented and illustrated. Pleospora
obtusispora var. obtusispora and var. triseptata and
Teichospora lonicerae are proposed as new. Teichospora
borealis, T. solitaria and T. winteriana are recorded
for the first time from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Pleospora and Teichospora have been
sparsely recognized in some provinces of China (Tai, 1979;
Eriksson and Yue, 1988). During a survey of Pyrenomycetes
in Xinjiang, some collections showing typical character-
istics of the genera Pleospora sensu lat. and Teichospora
were made within Xinjiang regions (province), mostly from
desert areas. These species have not been reported prev-
iously in China and some of them have not been described
either in China or elsewhere.#Misc-exposition*]

are deposited in the National Herbarium of Canada in
Ottawa (DAOM) and the isotypes in the Herbarium of

[@Two collections referrable to Pleospora are closely
related to P. richtophensis Ellis & Everh. (Wehmeyer
1961), having collabent ascomata whose peridium cells,
hyphae and hyphal appendages are thick walled and heavily

encrusted with pigment. The asci of these collections
tend to be longer and narrower, oblong rather than clavate
as in P. richtophensis. The ascospores differ from those

of P. richtophensis in more obtuse ends, into which the
longitudinal septum may extend, and in relatively small
sizes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@118#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gymnopilus Karst. is a large and complicated genus, in need of a monographic
study. Hesler (1969) treated 73 species, principally of North America, however many
tropical species remained unstudied. In this paper some aspects of the genus
classification are reviewed and a new species is proposed. Basidiomata slides were
mounted in 3 % KOH and in Melzer's reagent. The herbarium name abbreviations used
here follow Holmgren et al. (1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@GENUS CLASSIFICATION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Romagnesi (1942) was the first to divide the genus Gymnopilus in two
infrageneric groups, Annulati Romagnesi and Cortinati Romagnesi, according to the
veil. Singer (1949) considered the same divisions but as sections, the second one as
Sapinei Fr. and finally as Gymnopilus (Singer, 1986). Hesler (1969) also accepted these
divisions, but under the taxonomic rank of subgenus because he split subgenus
Gymnopilus in two sections, Microspori and Gymnopilus, the first one with spores 3.5-7
µm long and the second with spores (6-)7-9 µm long.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hesler included in Sect. Microspori species with 3.5-5.5 X 2.5-3.5 and 5.5-7(-
7.5) X 3.5-4.5 µm spores, and in Sect. Gymnopilus species with spores 6-9(-10) µm
long. According to the type examination of many species described by Hesler or species
considered in his work (Hesler, 1969), it became difficult to separate species in that
way, since a considerable number of species in two sections have spores 6-8 µm long.
For example, the type of G. obscurus Hesler (Thiers 9677, SFSC) has spores 6.8-8 µm
long, but Hesler described them as 5.5-7.5 µm long. In the type of G. subtropicus
Hesler (Thiers 6345, SFSC) the spores are 6-7.6 µm long (5.5-7 µm according to
Hesler) and in the type of G. sordidostipes Hesler (Smith 55808, MICH) the spores are
6-7.6(-8.5) µm long (idem as in Hesler). In the case of G. pacificus Hesler (Akamine
722, MICH, type) the difference is even greater because the spores measure 7-10 µm
long, against 5.5-7(-7.5) µm described by Hesler.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Based on the above examples, it is recommended to include all of the species
with spores 6-8 or 6-7.6 µm long in the section Gymnopilus to avoid confusion. The
species revised here and excluded from section Microspori by their big spores,
according to type examinations, are showed in table 1. On the other hand, in the section
Gymnopilus there is a group of species with bigger spores, 8-11(-12) µm long, easy to
distinguish from the rest and that could be segregated in a new section, which is
proposed here. The species included in the new section Macrospori are indicated in
table 2. In the case of G. magnus (Peck)Murr., Hesler (1969) described spores of 7.5-
10 µm long, but after revision of the specimen Imshaug 3944 (MICH), determined as
G. magnus by Hesler, it was found that the spores measure 8.5-12(-13) µm long.#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS. G. subfulgens is characterized by the size and color of the
basidiomata, by the size and form of the spores and by the radial pileus trama. The
spores in the revised materials changed to yellowish-brown in Melzer's reagent. This
can be interpreted as dextrinoid reaction, because the author has observed that in some
specimens of other species with typical dextrinoid spores, sometimes the spores discolor
to yellowish-brown or yellowish in Melzer's reagent (Guzmán-Dávalos, 1993). Both
studied specimens were originally identified as Phaeocollybia festiva (Fr.)Heim ex Sing.
at INIF Herbarium. This species is closely related to G. fulgens (Favre & Maire)Sing.,
in macro and microscopic characteristics, but they are distinct because G. fulgens has
distant lamellae and is mainly found in a terricolous habitat with mosses (Hesler, 1969).
Moreno (1980) described G. fulgens var. luteicystis Moreno, differing from the typical
variety by its’ smaller spores (7-8.5 X 4-5 µm) and for having some yellow cystidia.
The author of the present paper has observed that the last characteristic is very variable,
since materials in the same species present hyaline cystidia, or with yellow, yellowish
brown or orange-brown content. For this reason, it is not recommended to use the
cystidia color as a diagnostic characteristic in Gymnopilus. Another related species to
G. subfulgens is G. mesosporus Horak, which differs by the smaller basidioma, stipe
always eccentric, spores with a well developed plage and perisporium, and by the
absence of pleurocystidia (Horak, 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

hyphae, many with short side protrusions on the cells. The germlings

directions to produce the mature apothecia. A few branched initials were

[@Strobiloscypha shows definite affinities to the Sarcoscyphineae,
including the thick-walled, slender, apparently aporhynchous, J- asci;
much-branched, slender paraphyses; and ascospores that germinate
readily. Like some members of the Sarcoscyphaceae, e.g., Cookeina
tricholoma (Mont.) Kuntze (Pfister, 1978), the hymenium appears to be
exposed during it early development. In the Sarcosomataceae Chorioactis
geaster (Peck) Kupfer (Heald and Wolf, 1910; Seaver, 1942), Urnula
craterium (Schwein. : Fr.) Fr. (Davidson, 1950), and Neournula pouchetii
(Berthet and Riousset) Paden (N.S. Weber, personal observation), the
developing hymenium is enclosed within a hollow ascoma until the asci
are well developed. However, in Sarcosoma mexicana (Ellis and Holw. in
Holw.) Paden and Tylutki, the hymenium is exposed, often for several
weeks, before asci are evident and long before the ascospores mature
(Judy Roger and N.S. Weber, personal observations).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The asci arising deep in the subhymenium/medullary excipulum,
the dull coloration of the ascomata, and the hibernal fruiting pattern are
all features of the Sarcosomataceae. The combination of brown tones on
the abhymenial surface, dingy yellowish to olive yellow hymenial surface,
small fruiting bodies, substrate preference, and lack of gelatinization
appearsto be uniquein the family. The presence of cyanophilic markings,
although very small, on the ascospores indicates a possible placement in
tribe Galielleae. Cyanophilic ornamentation on the ascospores is the
primary character used to differentiate the tribe Galielleae from tribe
Sarcosomateae in the family Sarcosomataceae (Korf, 1970) and indeed
from all other members of the suborder Sarcoscyphineae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Korf (1973) included Nannfeldtiella Eckblad, Galiella Nannf. and Korf
in Korf, Wolfina Seaver ex Eckblad, and Neournula Paden and Tylutki in

family (i.e., Helvellaceae, Eckblad, 1968, and Eriksson and Hawksworth,
1988, or Pyronemataceae as a synonym of Pseudombrophila Boud.,
Harmaja, 1979); Wolfina has ascospores ornamented with longitudinal
ridges and corky ascomata; Neournula has distinctly warted ascospores
and urnulate, almost leathery, apothecia that are terrestrial. Galiella
shows the greatest similarity to Strobiloscypha but differs in having a well-
developed gelatinous medullary excipulum and well-developed vestiture#Misc-exposition*]

nus in the family Peltulaceae. Besides the type species of the
genus, WN. brasiliensis Zahlbr., the new species N. cataractae
Büdel & Sérusiaux from Zaire is included into the genus. The
ecology of the new species is discussed and a key is included.#Abstract*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cyanobacterial lichen family Peltulaceae was separated from the Heppi-
aceae on the basis of ascocarp development, ascus structure and function and
thallus anatomy (Biidel 1987a). In the past the genus Pe/tula, introduced in 1853
by Nylander for the desert soil living species Pe/tula radicata Nyl., was inclu-
ded into the genus Heppia or subdivided into a number of different taxa (Table
1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1909, Zahlbruckner introduced the new genus Neoheppia with
the type species N. brasiliensis Zahlbr., and placed it in the family Heppiaceae.
According to Zahlbruckner (1909), the new genus was separated from Heppia
byits truly crustose thallus, attached to the substrate by all parts of the lower
surface. Later on, Gyelnik (1935) excluded the genus Neoheppia from the Hep-
piaceae and transferred it to the Pyrenopsidaceae (= Lichinaceae according to
Henssen 1963). Since then, the status of the genus Neoheppia was not re-
vised, nor included in any other taxonomic treatment.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During a phytosociological survey of the vegetation along the
Tshopo river near Kisangani, Zaire, Léonard (1993) found a crustose lichen
growing on rock in the Tshopo river, periodically submerged during the rainy
season. It was sent to E. Sérusiaux (Liége, Belgium) and subsequently to me
for identification. It was found to be a new species of the genus Neoheppia. As
aresult, arevision of the genus is presented here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results and Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Neoheppia Zahlbr. is mainly characterized by its truly crustose-ri-
mose thallus (figs. 1-2, 4-6), attached to the substrate by the entire lower#Misc-exposition*]
[@139#Misc-exposition*]

[@surface (Zahlbruckner 1909). This attachment base is build up of anticlinally
arranged hyphae (fig. 7). The lichen has a pseudoparenchymatous or
prosoplectenchymatous, nongelatinous internal structure and the ascus of the
genus is polysporous, unitunicate-rostrate with a lacerate sheath surrounding
it (figs. 9 * 12). Ascomata and conidiomata are identical with those of the genus
Peltula (Büdel 1987a*b). All characters stated here support the placement of
Neoheppia as a good genus into the family Peltulaceae. Thus, Guelnik 's (1935)
transfer of the genus to the Pyrenopsidaceae can not be followed here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of the genus Pe/tula are attached to the substrate either
by rhizines (on rock or soil), tufts of rhizoidal hyphae (on soil) or an umbilicus
(on rock). They all share as a common feature a constriction of the single squa-
mule at the base, or, as in many soil inhabiting species, a more or less central
origin of rhizines and rhizoidal tufts. Even in crustose-effigurate species like
Peltula placodizans, P. tenuis (fig. 3) or P. impressa, the single, minute squa-
mules are attached bu a central umbilicus at the lower surface (comp. Büdel
19872, figs. 155, 183, 186 * 200).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genera Placoheppia and Solorinaria were separated from
Peltula by the mode of substrate fixation (Gyelnik 1935). Because the mode of
attachment varies with the substrate the species lived on, Wetmore (1971)
and later on Swinscow and Krog (1979) could not accept this as a usefull taxo-
nomic criterion. In the genus Neoheppia, the mode of attachment is always cor-
related with the crustose-rimose morphology of the thallus, and thus, is a sta-
ble character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genera Neoheppia and Peltula can easily be distinguished in
the side view or in cross sections: while the thallus or single squamules of Pe/-
tula always has the basal constriction, even in the smallest crustose species,
the attachment in Neoheppia is always performed by the entire lower surface.
As a result, species of Pelfula remind the shape of mushrooms, wheras spe-
cies of the genus Neoheppia are true flat crusts. The thallus of the genus Ne-
oheppia becomes secondarily areolated (= rimose) by cracks, developing in lar-
ger areoles or young thallus parts (figs. 1-6).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The thallus construction as a flat crust, tightly attached to the
rock surface in the two species resembles that of Pterygiopsis submersa Bü-
del, Henssen & Wessels and Porocyphus effiguratus Henssen, both species of
the lichen family Lichinaceae that also occur in running water along waterfalls
(Henssen et al. 1985). The flat, adnate and superficially smooth thalli with a
tight, prosoplectenchymatous internal morphology, thus might be interpreted
as an adaptation to the habitat on rocks in rapids or waterfalls of rivers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology: Neoheppia cataractae has been rarely observed (in 2 phytosociologi-
cal relevés out of 8) in the Leiothylax quangensis (Engl.) Warm. and Lederman-
niella congolana (Hauman) C. Cusset association (Podostamaceae) in which it
was forming a crustaceous stratum (Léonard 1993). This association was gro-
wing in the rapids and in the waterfalls on rocks frequently and violently beaten
by water, but generally not submerged during the low water period.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@The new species has mostly been observed (in 5 relevés out of 6,
but with low cover values) in the Eragrostis barteri Hubb. (Graminea) and Dy-
schoriste perrottetii (Nees) O. Ktze. (Acanthaceae) association (Léonard
1993). In this vegetation, the new species was forming a crustaceous stratum
covering 5-20% of the surface with 4 other species of lichens, including Pe/tula
euploca ( Ach.) Poelt ex PiSut and Peltula tortuosa (Nees) Wetmore (plus Leca-
nora sp. and a sterile crust). The Eragrostis-Dyschoriste-vegetation has
been found in the cracks of rocks either periodically flooded by a rapid of the
Tshopo river and not submerged during the low water-level period, or perio-
dically flooded during the high water-level period of the neighbouring Zaire ri-
ver and under light sprays during the low water-level period.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amongst the various types of vegetation existing from the centre
of the Tshopo waterfalls towards the banks, the optimum of development of N.
cataractae seems to be situated in the Eragrostis-Dyschoriste association
(see the synthetical association table in Léonard 1993: 336).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: The new species is distinguished from N. brasiliensis by its non effi-
gurate, olive-colored thallus with black margins along cracks and areoles, the
apothecia with punctiform discs and the remarkably larger spores. N. catarac-
tae is only known from the type locality.#Misc-exposition*]

that the species (Prerospora atrocyanea Métrod) belongs in Marasmiellus
Murrill, that other species placed in Prerospora by Horak (1983) [and later in
Tetrapyrgos E.Horak (Horak, 1987)) belong in Marasmiellus or, mostly, in
Campanella Henn. Prerospora olivaceonigra E.Horak was first described from New
Zealand (Horak, 1983), and is a common | of south-eastern Australia. A
collection from Victoria is illustrated by May (1989). The stipe is lateral, lamellae are
intervenose, the pileal context is gelatinised, and basidioles are clavate or only rarely
fusoid. Prerospora olivaceonigra is therefore best placed in Campanella.

[@The lichen genus Feigeana Mies, Lumbsch & Tehler was discovered in the
eastern part of Socotra, an island incompletely known to lichenology since
the works of Miiller-Aargau (1882, 1888), Darbishire (1903), and J.Steiner
(1907). The geologically isolated position of the Socotran archipelago since
late Cretaceous periods has resulted in a large number of endemic taxa,
contributing to the evolution of fungi and lichens respectively. There have
only been a few collections of lichens in this part of the Eritreo-Arabian
flora region - mostly described as endemics - by Balfour, Cockburn & Scott
1880 (in herbarium G), Schweinfurth 1881 (in G), and Simony, Paulay &#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type material was studied from two collections 1993 and 1994 from

performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of acetone extracts of thalli was
carried out using standard methods (Feige et al. 1993). The terms of
morphological and anatomical structures refer to Tehler (1990), the
phytogeographical categories to Zohary (1973) and Al-Hubaishi & Müller-

[@Notes: The ascomata are similar to those of Syncesia and Chiodecton. The

phytochemistry, the habitat, and the biogeographical distribution (actually
known).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Feigeana complies with the criteria for which Arthoniales are diagnosed
(Tehler 1990; Tehler 1993b). In order to determine its phylogenetic position
within the order Arthoniales the data set used in Feigeana socotrana was
added to the data set in Tehler (1990). The data coded for Feigeana
socotrana in the new matrix was 11012 ??211 ?2111 110?1 10000 0012?
10?0? (0&1)(0&1)021 12201 21111 12212 11200 11111 11202 10211
01010 00001 00000 11 consecutively following Tehler (1990). Character
exclusions and command and option settings for the phylogenetic analysis
computer program were set the same as in previous analysis (Tehler
1990). Five terminals, Cookella, Arthothelium, Arthonia, Chiodecton and
Schismatomma were excluded from the original data set and the present
cladogram was rooted with the genus Syncesia (Tehler 1993b; Tehler 1995)
which is the sister group to the families Opegraphaceae and Roccellaceae#Misc-exposition*]
[@161#Misc-exposition*]
[@(Tehler 1993a, b). Three trees were obtained with a length of a 204 steps, a
consistancy index of 0.379 and a retention index (Farris 1989) of 0.439.
As a result of the present analysis it was clear that Feigeana should be
included in the family Roccellaceae (Arthoniales). That family has been
shown to be a well corroborated group (Tehler 1990; 1993b) something
which is supported also by the present analysis. However, some of the
subgroups in Roccellaceae were known to be unstable and unconvincingly
supported and as was predicted already in Tehler (1990), rearrangements
could be expected when additional taxa were to be included in future
analyses. The inclusion of Feigeana in the data set resulted in some
considerable changes in tree topology within Roccellaceae, although the
gross topology is still supported. Feigeana socotrana forms a sister pair with
the endemic species Hubbsia lumbricoides from Isla Guadalupe outside the
coast of Baja California, Mexico. Feigeana and Hubbsia in turn, make up
the sister group to the sister pair Combea mollusca and Dolichocarpus
chilensis, the former endemic to the Cape Province in South Africa and the
latter endemic to the central parts of the Chilean west coast. Hence,
Dolichocarpus chilensis has been transferred from the clade with
Darbishirella, Gorgadesia and Roccellographa in Tehler (1990) over to the
clade with Schizopelte, Hubbsia, Combea, Dirina and Roccella.
The new cladogram is still unconvincingly supported which is evident from
the low consistency index and the low Bremer support index (Bremer 1988)
of only 1, i.e. hitherto the cladogram collapses when trees one step longer
than the shortest tree are included. Hence, firm relationships within the
family are to be awaited .#Misc-exposition*]

[@Distribution and habitat: Feigeana socotrana is hitherto only known from
the type locality. The Eocene reef complex of Ant Kashara is deeply
furrowed into 3 to 8 m high limestone blocks with steep faces, which are
densely covered by  7rentepohlia lichens of the Roccellaceae,
Opegraphaceae, Arthoniaceae, etc. beneath huge Dracaena cinnabari trees
(Mies & Zimmer 1993). At an elevation of 400 m a.s.l. the locality is still
influenced by the fringes of air-blown sea foam, which - together with high
aridity - merely enables halotolerant or halophytic plant species to grow
(Mies & Zimmer 1993). Feigeana socotrana was accompanied by Dirina
massiliensis, D. immersa, Helminthocarpon spp., Roccellina cinerea,
Rocccellographa cretacea, Simonyella variegata, Arthonia cinnabari, and a
overwhelming wealth of opegraphaceous and chiodectonaceous species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Five species of the genus Phanerochaete with brown
subicular hyphae have been studied. Specimens including types
of P. brunnea, P. fuscomarginata and P. singularis were
reexamined for their macroscopic and microscopic characters.
A new combination, P. monomitica, is proposed. P.
collected from Taipei, Taiwan, is presented as a new species.
Moreover, cultural studies for P. brunnea and P.
are given.#Abstract*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phanerochaete Karst. is a relatively abundant genus in
family Corticiaceae, with more than fifty species worldwide
(Burdsall 1985, Hjortstam 1987 and Wu 1990). Most members of
the genus Phanerochaete are with hyaline subicular hyphae,
but some species in this genus consists of a unique brown
subicular hyphae. First member (P. fuscomarginata) of
Phanerochaete with brown hyphae was noted by Gilbertson et
al. (1972). In 1985, a second species (P. ) of this
group was proposed by Burdsall (1985). He noted that "the
yellow-brown tinted hyphae are not typical of ?
but the other microscopic characters agree well". Recently,
Wu (1990) found a third species (P. brunnea) which also have
the brown subicular hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In July of 1991, a brownish basidiomycete on dead
angiosperm branch with a fairly large fruiting body, was
collected from lowland of northern Taiwan. The fruiting body
is effuse-with recurved margins, having fairly tough
consistency. The macroscopic characters look alike to a
member of genus Stereum Pers. However, its microscopic
features indicate that this species represents a

species with brown subicular hyphae. In this
paper, I propose this species, P. stereoides, as new to#Misc-exposition*]
[@164#Misc-exposition*]

[@science. In addition, I examined two specimens of Duportella
monomitica and found that features of these two specimens
match those of genus Phanerochaete. Therefore, a new
combination is also proposed in this study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Members of this brown hyphae group have been referred as
other genera. For example, Peniophora fuscomarginata Burt was
transferred by Gilbertson (Gilbertson et al. 1972) to
Phanerochaete, but was considered by Burdsall (1985) as more
appropriate in Peniophora Cooke. Duportella monomitica G.H.
Cunn. was placed by Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1990) in
Porostereum Pilát. The placements were largely based on the
presence of brown hyphae of most species of these genera.
However, the resemblances are superficial. Phanerochaete
fuscomarginata is not in possession of two main features of
Peniophora, the presence of either lamprocystidia or
gloeocystidia and pale-red spore deposit. Moreover, the brown
hyphae in subiculum of Phanerochaete monomitica are
generative hyphae, not the brown skeletal hyphae which
normally present in Duportella Pat. and Porostereum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study examines all five known species of this
brown subicular hyphae group using morphological comparisons
and cultural studies. Objectives of this study are to make
differences among species of this unique group, and to
propose a proper generic placement of this group in taxonomy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods for morphological studies of fruit bodies,
including both macroscopic and microscopic characters have
been described by Wu (1990). Cultural codes are from Nobles
(1965) with amendments by Boidin and Lanquetin (1983). Other
modifications included incubation of cultures at 25 @ and
plates inverted. The inverted plates correspond to the
orientation of fruit body formation in nature. Drop tests for
extracellular oxidases follow Marr (1979). Nuclear stainings
were made with Giemsa according to Boidin (1958). Terminology
for nuclear behaviour is based on Boidin and Lanquetin
(1984).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abbreviations of the herbaria follow Holmgren et al.
(1990). Many specimens are deposited at National Museum of
Natural Science of ROC, which is abbreviated as N.M.N.S.#Misc-exposition*]

subicular hyphae. Therefore, I suggest this species should be

[@The brown and thick-walled generative hyphae of

possibility of dimitism in this species. Additionly, the
hyaline and thin-walled subhymenial hyphae are arising from
the brown, thick-walled hyphae, again proving the brown ones
are generative hyphae. In culture, generative hyphae of
aerial mycelium are hyaline to brownish, thin- to thick-
walled, and the changes are continuous. This indicates that
the brown and thick-walled hyphae are not different from
generative hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This new species is similar to Phanerochaete monomitica

sized basidiospores. Two major differences are: First,
hymenial surface of P. monomitica is usually cracked, but it
is not cracked in the well-developed type specimen of P.

the similar sized basidiospores and the cystidia. However,
fruit body consistency and colors are distinctly different

fairly hard. In addition, subicular hyphae of P. stereeoides

[@If no or only very poor syntype material had survived, it would have been easy to drop
the name Leptosphaeria gigaspora sensu Niessl completely or to designate a neotype as
soon as the species was collected again. Recently, a satisfactory syntype specimen of L.
gigaspora from the Saccardo herbarium in PAD, most probably the collection described
and illustrated by Berlese (1894: 70; Tab. LVII/1), has become available. It agrees with
Berlese's illustrations, but a brief re-description seems appropriate. Mounts of dried
herbarium material were prepared in various media (tap water, 196 KOH, lactic blue) and
observed in bright field LM.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Miller (1950: 204) assigned Leptosphaeria gigaspora to the genus Wettsteinina, but the
epithet had to be changed because of the existence of W. gigaspora Höhn., the type

is available, and it seems premature to describe a new monotypic genus in the largely
unresolved tangle of herbicolous and graminicolous bitunicate species with hyaline,
mostly 1- or 3-septate ascospores, where a number of characters should be re-examined
with regard to possible convergent lines of evolution. Finally, at least one very similar
species in the genus Wettsteinina, W. candida Shoemaker & Babcock (1987: 377), also
has large fusiform ascospores, numerous asci and interascal filaments, and a similar, but
more rudimentary epidermal clypeus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are two major differences between the measurements in the descriptions of carts
authors and the present lectotype: (1) fruit body size: Berlese (1894: 70) gives 15 - Vs
mm; this might be the size of the accompanying Stagonospora pycnidia rather than the
larger ascomata of W. niesslii. (2) ascospore length: The longest ascospores in the
present collection measure 70 µm, about 8-10 µm longer than the measurements given
by Berlese (1894: 70) and Müller (1950: 205), and 15 µm longer than those in Winter
(1887: 450). In spite of this discrepancy, the ascospore proportions in Berlese's (1894:
Tab. LVII/1) drawing are correct, and the doubts raised by Scheuer (1988; 188, 257)
were not adequate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The former syntype specimen of V. niesslii from the Niessl collection in M, apparently
from a different locality in Moravia (Leptosphaeria gigaspora n.sp., auf Carex paludosa,
[handwriting illegible] bei Brünn, Niessl) does not contain any well developed
ascomata of this species. Only one small leaf fragment with some empty fruitbodies that
might have been W. niesslii could be found in this collection. The other leaves in this
syntype specimen still bear numerous pycnidia of a large-spored Stagonospora, most
probably Niessl's Hé , but no of W. niesslii. It is necessary
to designate a lectotype because Niessl has not given any detailed collecting data with
the protologue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A specimen from North Sweden (on leaves of Carex saxatilis x vesicaria, Torne
Lappmark, Jukkasjärvi s:n, Vassitjäkka, 16 Aug. 1936, J. A. Nannfeldt; UPS), listed by
Eriksson (1992: 112) is included here with some reluctance. It is definitely very close to
W. niesslii s.str., but because the morphological variability of W. niesslii is poorly
known, studies of further collections will be necessary to determine whether this one can
safely be regarded as conspecific. The following differences should be noted: (1) The
peridium is slightly thinner, less pigmented, pale to middle brown in transmitted light, but
with a conspicuous tomentum of concolorous, densely interwoven hyphae. (2) The
ascospores are slightly shorter (55-60 µm) and they apparently become (3-4-)5-septate
already before discharge (septation sequence usually 3:2:1:2:3). In fully mature ascomata
a few asci containing pale brown, S-septate ascospores with distinctly punctate walls
have been observed. Occasionally 6-septate ascospores occurred (septation sequence
4:3:2:1:2:3), very similar to those of W. candida Shoemaker & Babcock (1987: 377),
but the ascospores of this species are regularly 6-septate (septation sequence
4:3:2:1:2:4).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Excluded taxa and specimens#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collections on Carex paniculata L. treated as 'Wettsteinina cf. niesslii' by Scheuer
(1988: 187) are very similar to the lectotype of W. niesslii, but definitely smaller in all
parts, with a delicate, macroscopically + indiscernible epidermal clypeus, like in W.
candida Shoemaker & Babcock (1987: 377). The material in herb. Scheuer is too scant
to select a type specimen, therefore the species on Carex paniculata has to remain
unnamed. The species reported by Pugh (1958: 187) as 'Leptosphaeria? gigaspora', also
on Carex p lata, is probably identical with Scheuer’s 'We cf. niessli?', but it
has not been examined. Another fungus almost identical with W. niesslii in microscopical
structure, but much smaller in all parts is Didymella caricis H. Sydow (1921: 305), a
species which seems to be more common than W. niesslii (e.g., Scheuer 1988: 65), it has
also been reported from the Isle of Skye (Scotland) by Spooner & Dennis (1986: 296).#Misc-exposition*]


[@177#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus on Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. described by Müller (1950:
204; ZT) as W. niesslii has been re-examined. For a description of the ZT specimen see
Shoemaker & Babcock (1987: 391, as Lophiostoma species 2). Although the ascospore
measurements agree very well with the present lectotype, it is not conspecific and
apparently not congeneric with W. niesslii s.str. It should be noted here that the
gelatinous appendages of ascospores from herbarim material of this species on
Phragmites apparently do not swell and elongate in water in the same way as those from
living material (see, e.g., the drawings by Ingold 1955: 166). Baral (1992: 354-356) has
demonstrated the striking morphological differences between gelatinous ascospore wall
layers of freshly collected and rehydrated herbarium material. The somewhat radial
structure of the apical portion of the ascoma wall reminds of Lophiotrema or
Lophiostoma spp. and is very different from the one in W. niesslii, although the peridial
structure may be subject to considerable modification due to the mechanical properties of
the given substrate. The culms of Phragmites are much harder and tougher than the
leaves of the larger Carex spp. The dark 'clypeus' of the species on Phragmites is
superficially similar, but these ascomata bear numerous hyaline periphyses-like hyphae
lining the ± elongate ostiolar opening. Together with the thinner and more numerous
interascal filaments (apparently also pseudoparaphyses), the presence of these periphysis-
like hyphae supports Shoemaker & Babcock's (1987: 391) view that the species on
Phragmites belongs to the Lophiostomataceae, in spite of the absence of a protruding,
laterally compressed ostiolar papilla. Eriksson & Yue (1986; 252), Eriksson &
Hawksworth (1986; 142), and Barr (1987: 106) have only recently suggested to merge
Massarinaceae (with ± rounded ostioles) and Lophiostomataceae (with laterally
compressed ostioles). The species on Phragmites is apparently undescribed, but the ZT
specimen is too scant and should not serve as type material. Fresh collections are
desirable for the description of a new species. Contrary to Müller's (1950: 204)
illustration, both Wettsteinina niesslii s.str. on Carex and the species on Phragmites have
interascal filaments, most probably pseudoparaphyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Barr (1961: 308) reported two collections of Wettsteinina niesslii from Canada; one of
them, on Carex rostrata Stokes, is Wettsteinina candida Shoemaker & Babcock (1987:

(Shoemaker & Babcock 1987: 404), but has not so far been validly described, According
to Barr (1961: 308, 1972: 544) it resembles Monascostroma bacilliferum (P. Karst.) O.
E. Erikss. (apparently specific to Scheuchzeria palustris L.), but unfortunately her
suggestions have not been discussed by Eriksson (1982: 196) or by Shoemaker &
Babcock (1987: 377).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the taxonomical review of the genus Tulostoma in the
Mediterranean basin that we are carrying out, we have observed that in this
geographical region there are quite favourable environmental conditions for
the growth and fructification of Gasteromycetes. Even more, there are
some very interesting areas in the mentioned region that still keep
mycological novelties, due to the low number of the explorations carried
out there, the scarce mycologists studying them, and the inherent difficulties
of the physical medium. This is the case of the Northwestern Africa, an
especially important area for us on account of its relation with the Iberian
Peninsula. Lately we have described the new species Tulostoma
scrupososporum from Morocco (Altés et.al., 1994). This time we report the
presence of Tulostoma opacum Long in the same country, a species that
only has been recorded till now in Southern United States and Northern
Mexico (Wright, 1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods and terminology follow those of Tulloss ef al. (1992), Tulloss (1993),
and Tulloss (1994). Color codes of the form “6D6” are from (Kornerup & Wans-
cher, 1978). With one exception (RET—Tulloss’ personal herbarium), abbreviations
of names of herbaria follow Holmgren ef al. (199%). In carrying out the
phenoloxidase spot tests for this species, we did not wash a longitudinal section of a
specimen with reagent (e.g., Marr, 1979; Marr et al., 1986; Tulloss, 1993), but
applied the reagent by single drops in restricted spots: pileus surface at about mid-
radius, lamella surface near the free edge, interior tissue of volval limb, context of
stipe in portion above bulb, context of bulb, surface of annulus. Spot tests reported
for other reagents were applied in the same spots or a subset of them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita longitibiale is one of the relatively few taxa in section Phalloideae with
cylindric to bacilliform spores. Unlike all such taxa previously described, A.
longitibiale has a pigmented pileipellis. If pigmentation is set aside, the taxa that
should be examined with relation to a claim of novelty for A. longitibiale are A.
cylindrispora Beardslee (1936) known from the southeastern U.S.A., A. gilbertii
Beauseigneur (1925) known from the Mediterranean region, and A. virosiformis
(Murr.) Murr. (1941) [=?A. tenuifolia (Murr.) Murr. (1945)] known from the
southeastern U.S.A.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The appearance of the volval limb in some exsiccata of A. longitibiale is quite
reminiscent of the limb on the less radicating bulb of exsiccata of A. cylindrispora.
However, in several of the exsiccata examined (e.g., the portion of MEXU 23831 in
RET), it is clear that the volva of A. longitibiale is truly saccate—often being con-
nected to the bulb only in its lower 20+ %.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tulloss has examined many collections of A. cylindrispora including all of
Beardslee's original material that could be located (BPl; CUP; FLAS; L; MICH;
NCU; RET). The value of Q* obtained in this study exceeds 3.1. Also, while up to
two thirds of the stipe of A. cylindrispora may be found below the surface of the sub-
strate, the bulb is often not so markedly radicating as in A. longitibiale and takes up a
smaller portion of the stipe. Moreover, the partial veil in A. cylindrispora is often
rather small and delicate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@201#Misc-exposition*]

[@A number of southern European and north African collections of A. gilbertii
deposited in L have been examined by Tulloss. The spores of this species are very
comparable in size and shape to those of A. longitibiale, the variable bulb of A. gil-
bertii may be somewhat radicating although the drawing in the protologue and an
additional sketch by R. Bertault (deposited in L) show the base of the bulb as
rounded. The partial veil of this species has more inflated cells than were found in
that of A. longitibiale; and the subhymenium of A. gilbertii has considerably fewer
inflated elements than does the subhymenium of the New World species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The holotypes of A. renuifolia and A. virosiformis (FLAS) have been examined by
Tulloss—as part of an as yet unpublished study of North American white members of
section Phalloideae having limbate volvas. The bulb in these species is not radicating
as in A. longitibiale and the volval limb is brief; in the material examined to date, the
spores have Q in the range 2.45 - 2.65.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tulloss has examined the holotype collection (NYS) of A. peckiana, an isotype
(MICH), and, in all, more than 80 specimens of the species in preparing an as yet
unpublished monograph on Amanita section Amidella (E. J. Gilb.) Konr. & M. for
North America. Amanita longitibiale differs from A. peckiana by its nonappendicu-
late pileus margin, its more persistent annulus, its rather deeply radicating stipe base,
its subhymenium of inflated and partially inflated cells which is not dominated by
hyphae running subparallel to the hymenial surface, its broad and markedly divergent
lamella trama, etc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MEXU 17384 was selected as holotype because the collection is in good condi-
tion, good color transparencies of it are located in MEXU, and it has been figured as
an illustration of A. peckiana sensu Herrera & Pérez-Silva twice and (in both
instances) was one of the specimens contributing to the accompanying description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MEXU 4050b is immature with the partial veil still largely covering the lamellae
and few spores present on the hymenium. However, we have concluded that it is
appropriate to assign it to A. longitibiale because of its habit, coloring, and the
anatomy of its subhymenium and lamella trama.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anaerobic gut fungi from herbivores are classified in the
Chytridiomycota, a phylum popularly known as chytrids. Based on
biochemical evidence (Bartnicki-Garcia 1970, 1987), and on analysis of
the 18S rRNA (Bowman et al. 1992, Dore and Stahl 1991, Li and Heath
1992), it has been shown that chytrids are true fungi, albeit
morphologically primitive. The taxonomy of chytrids is as much an#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Contribution LRS#3879431#Misc-exposition*]
[@204#Misc-exposition*]

[@enigma to most mycologists as it is to bacteriologists. The problems in
the study of chytrids are that they are difficult to isolate and grow in
culture, and once in culture there is extensive morphological variation.
For example, when cultured under different growing conditions an isolate
may show so much variation that it could easily be mistaken as two or
three unlike species. Morphological variation can be attributed to
changes in the carbon source and medium (nutritional), the age of the
culture, and strain differences. Among aerobic chytrids morphological
variation crosses generic and family ranks, and attempts have been made
to classify genera and higher taxa on zoospore ultrastructure (Barr 1980,
1990), but for practical reasons species must be recognizable on thallus
morphology as seen in the light microscope. A full understanding of
morphological variation is therefore essential before the classification and
identification of gut fungi is perfected. However, much of the descriptive
work has been done on a relative few isolates, and for some species on a
single isolate. The examination of 85 isolates from the rumen of moose,
elk, and bison, and 19 additional isolates from sheep and cattle provides
useful information on morphological variation within the five species
found, and contributes to a better understanding of their classification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ruminal fluid was obtained by stomach tube and vacuum pump from
a moose, bison and two elk. These animals were maintained in outdoor
pens and the elk and bison were fed poor quality timothy hay ad libitum
twice daily. The moose was allowed to browse freely on aspen (Populus
tremuloides). Ruminal fluid was also collected from a ruminal fistulated
Holstein steer fed alfalfa hay and from three fistulated Hereford steers fed
either alfalfa or orchard grass of poor or good quality. Finally, samples
were collected from two ruminal fistulated sheep fed diets of either 50%
barley and 50% rye grass, or rye grass. Steers and sheep were housed in
individual metabolisms stalls and fed twice daily.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolations were conducted using the anaerbobic technique of Hungate
(1950) as modified by Bryant and Burkey (1953). A modification of
Joblin’s (1981) technique which included antibiotic control of bacterial
contaminants (Bouchop and Mountford 1981) was used to isolate ruminal
fungi from serial dilutions of ruminal fluid plated on agar. Plates were
incubated in an anaerobic chamber under an atmosphere of 90%
CO,:10% Hy at 39°C. Once isolated, fungi were maintained on defined
medium B (Lowe et al. 1985) modified to contain either Whatman No.#Misc-exposition*]

tubing was parboiled, washed, reboiled and rewashed to remove glycerol
before use. Cultures were viewed by light microscopy under phase
contrast illumination as described by Barr et al. (1989). Out of 104
isolates only four were unidentified because of poor growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]
[@Neocallimastix frontalis (Braune) Heath (Figs. 1-7)#Nomenclature*]

[@Fifty-three isolates were examined from sheep, moose, bison and elk.
The morphology of these on dialysis tubing compared very favorably with
the description of N. variabilis Ho & Barr (Ho et al. 1993). However,
there is substantial morphological variation influenced by nutrition.
Moreover, a critical comparison of the type isolates of N. frontalis from
New Zealand and N. patriciarum Orpin & Munn from the United
Kingdom, with isolates of Neocallimastix from the U.S.A. (Wubah 1991)
provides compelling evidence that N. variabilis, N. patriciarum, and
possibly N. hurleyensis Theodorou & Webb are synonymous with N.
frontalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There was no conspicuous variation between isolates in either
zoospore size or flagellum length. Zoospores were ovoid to globose and
most were 6-9 µm diameter, occasionally as small as 5 µm or as large as
13 µm. Flagella of fixed zoospores tend to cling together whereas those
of living zoospores are readily shed. The only certain way of counting the
number of flagella accurately is by ultrastructural examination of
zoospores in mature sporangia and counting the number of basal bodies
(kinetosomes) or flagella in cross section, a task which obviously cannot
be done for more than a few zoospores, and was beyond the scope of this
study. All active zoospores were polyflagellate but many quiescent, and
presumably moribund zoospores were uniflagellate. Ultrastructurally
there is a lateral root of micro- and megatubules (Heath et al. 1983, Li
etal. 1991), and most likely one basal body has firmer anchorage than the
others, and is shed last. Thus, on examination of a few quiescent
zoospores, a culture of N. frontalis might mistakenly be determined as
Piromyces communis Gold, a morphological similar species that is
uniflagellate.#Description*]

[@Endo- exogenous sporangial development was affected by the media.
Endogenous sporangia developed from enlargement of zoospore cysts#Description*]
[@206#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Figs. 1-2); there were no sporangiophores. Exogenous sporangia develop
from the apical germination of zoospore cysts; the germ tube grows into
a tubular sporangiophore (Fig. 3) and the sporangium develops terminally
(Fig. 4). On filter paper cultures examined were primarily endogenous
with globose sporangia. On dialysis tubing cultures were mostly
exogenous with ellipsoidal sporangia. Previous observations of isolates
of Neocallimastix sp. from a Holstein steer (Barr et al. 1989) reported that
sporangia grown on dialysis tubing were primarily endogenous, and only
about 5% were exogenous. This contrasts with our observations of
isolates from moose, bison, elk and sheep in which the sporangia were
primarily exogenous. Some sporangiophores were over 1 mm long. The
frequency of exogenous thalli may be a matter of natural selection related
to the environment of the host animal, and the quality of feed. Thus,
from range animals (this study) and animals in the tropics (Ho et al.
1993) where the quality of feed is generally poor, there may be a natural
selection for Neocallimastix with exogenous growth forms.#Description*]

[@The most striking variation in the morphology of our isolates was in
the branching of the sporangiophore. Most often the sporangiophore was
unbranched and developed a single sporangium. When branching
occurred (Fig. 5), a second sporangium started to develop but aborted
early in development, or if it developed it failed to produce zoospores.
Less often there were two mature sporangia (Figs. 6-7), and rarely three.
Multisporangial thalli appeared to be more common in some isolates than
in others and the frequency of these isolates was not correlated with host
species. In many isolates branched sporangiophores were not seen at all,
but in others they occurred infrequently, and in two isolates the frequency
of multisporangial forms probably exceeded 10%. The significance of this
observation is that a single isolate with a high frequency of
multisporangial forms could easily be considered sufficiently distinct to be
a new species. Our observations of numerous isolates show that this is#Description*]

[@Piromyces rhizinflata Breton et al. (Figs. 8-16)#Nomenclature*]

[@This species was originally isolated by Breton et al. (1991) from fecal
material of a Saharian ass in Tunisia. In our study twenty-one isolates
were examined from the rumen of bison, two from moose and one from
an elk. Sporangia developed both endogenously and exogenously. The
apparent difference in descriptions of the Tunisian and Albertan isolates
probably relates to the application of terms, but there are also real
morphological differences attributable to the substrate. Breton et al.
(1991) report the occasional presence of a short sporangiophore on thalli
grown on filter paper, but elsewhere state there is an absence of
sporangiophores, and that sporangia are strictly endogenous. We consider
the presence of a short sporangiophore (see their Fig. 1d) determines that
the sporangium can also be exogenous. On dialysis tubing our isolates
often developed a short sporangiophore, but did so infrequently on filter
paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conspicuous character of P. rhizinflata was the constricted neck,
that often appeared as a refringent ring or slightly elongated and
isthmus-like (Figs. 8-15). (The neck is a point between the sporangium
and rhizoid, and the port is the opening in the neck.) In this species
these characteristics are determined during very early thallus development

[@development of a fine (rhizoidal) germ tube. Then the base of the cyst
becomes slightly thickened as the apical side enlarges. The thickening of
the base presumably prevents expansion of the port, and contributes to
the refringent ring. Simultaneous with apical expansion of the cyst, there
was an expansion of the main rhizoid below the neck. The cyst enlarged
into an endogenous sporangium, or a sporangium formed from the apex
of the cyst (Fig. 12) with or without a septum, or a sporangium developed
from a short sporangiophore (Fig. 14). There was great variation in
sporangium shape and size. Sporangia were as small as 8 X 20 µm, and
these were elongated, ovate or pyriform. Larger sporangia were broadly
ellipsoidal to more or less spherical. The largest sporangia were 130 µm
in diameter but these became moribund. Zoospore discharge occurred
following dissolution of an apical pore, and following discharge the
sporangium wall remained temporarily intact.#Description*]

[@P. rhizinflata is distinct from P. communis based on rhizoidal
development, the absence of long sporangiophores when compared on
dialysis tubing, the presence of a wide discharge pore, a persistent
sporangium wall following discharge, and the shape of the sporangium.
P. rhizinflata differs from both P. spiralis Ho which has more spherical
sporangia, highly evanescent sporangial walls, and markedly coiled
rhizoids, and P. minutus Ho which has conspicuously small sporangia. P.
rhizinflata may be similar to P. dumbonica Li but information of the
morphology of this latter species is scant. Differences with P. mae Li are
discussed below.#Description*]

larger sporangia globose, 35-60 4 µm diam. The main rhizoid was not
conspicuously inflated, and only occasionally as broad as 8 µm. In the
two elk surveyed, P. mae occurred in one animal and P. rhizinflata in the
other. The differences between the two species are the discharge papillae,
the neck constriction, and our isolates of P. mae were strictly endogenous.
The discharge area in P. mae was usually conspicuous as a knob-like
projection (Fig. 17), and in many instances there was a noticeable arc of
hyaline material (Figs. 18-19). In both species following discharge there
was a wide pore (Fig. 20) and the wall was persistent for a while in
contrast to P. communis which has a highly evanescent wall. The neck in
P. mae was often constricted as in P. rhizinflata, but in other thalli it was
broader and the port wide. Nonetheless, there is an overlap in characters
between these two species, and on examination of a few thalli it might be
difficult to make an accurate determination.#Description*]

[@This species was described from the rumen of a sheep in France

Kudo from the rumen of a Holstein steer in Alberta (Barr et al. 1989).
We have four additional isolates from sheep. This species and
Anaeromyces mucronatus tend to lose their ability to produce sporangia
in culture. Sterile cultures cannot be identified with absolute certainly,
but there are morphological characteristics that distinguish the two
species. In sterile mycelium of O. joyonii there are small sporangiophore
initials consisting of swollen lateral outgrowths which generally become
lobed and a few develop into sporangiophore complexes without
producing mature sporangia (Figs. 21-22). In O. intercalaris Ho, a species
only recently described from Malaysia (Ho et al. 1994), sporangia develop
from the expansion or lateral outgrowth of a hypha, but not from lobed
complexes. In A. mucronatus these structures are absent.#Description*]

[@Endosporisorium differs from Ustilago (Persoon) Roussel in possessing groups of
seriis cells intermixed with the spores, and in forming loose spore balls when
the spores are young. Endosporisorium differs from Sporisorium Ehrenberg ex
Link in having "internal" sori, within the host tissues, lacking peridium and
columella. The sori of Endosporisorium are restricted to the stems. Those of
Sporisorium are usually in the flowers, spikelets or in the whole inflorescence,
only rarely extending to the stems, in this case the sori are "external", covered
by a fungal peridium and occasionally by leaf sheaths. For Sporisorium the
following characters are typical: the presence of a more or less well-developed
fungal peridium, one or several columellae of host origin and sterile cells (not
always present) between the more or less permanent spore balls. In Sorosporium
Rudolphi the spore balls, which differ from those of Sporisorium, are rather
permanent, sterile cells, peridium and columella are lacking. While species of
Endosporisorium and Sporisorium parasitize members of the Gramineae family,
Sorosporium does not occur on this host family; the reported Sorosporium species
on Gramineae belong to other fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

differences in the morphology of the sori, spores and sterile cells of these two

of the lack of chloroplasts in these cells, an effect of the infection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHANGES IN LYOPHILIZED CULTURES OF ASPERGILLI AND PENICILLIA#Misc-exposition*]

[@JYOTI SAXENA#Misc-exposition*]
[@Botany Department, Kumaun University, Nainital - 263002, INDIA#Institution*]

[@Abstract: Lyophilized cultures of Aspergillus and Penicillium stored for more than
thirty five years were examined for characters of taxonomic importance. There were
only few vanations recorded in microscopic characters eg. size and shape of
sterigmata, conidia etc. but a marked variation in many cases in the characteristic
exudates from the colonies and the soluble pigments in agar plates.#Abstract*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lyophilization technique has proved to be a most convenient and successful
method of preserving sporulating fungi. It has been in regular use since Raper and
Alexander (1945) reported good survivals for fungi at the Northern Regional Research
Laboratory, Peoria, Il. (USA). Cultures of Aspergilli and Penicillia, most of them brought
by Prof. B.S. Mehrotra, from NRRL Culture Collection, Peoria, IL (USA), way back in
1957 and others were lyophilized at the same time in India. In India they were stored
under fluctuating temperatures first in a refrigerator in the — climate of Allahabad
(at the time of power failure and brief breakdowns of the refrigerator, the temperature
may have varied from 20 to 48 °C)and then in a steel cabinet (temperature ranging from 2
to 30 °C) in the sub temperate climate of Nainital (Mehrotra, 1985). In the present report
cultures developed from those lyophilized tubes were examined with respect to characters
of taxonomic importance#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultures were grown in the media of the same composition (Czapek’s Dox
Agar and Czapek Yeast Autolysate Agar) as were used for the studies reported in Raper
and Fennell's (1977) and Pitt's (1979) manuals of Aspergilli and Penicillia, respectively.
The cultures were incubated at 25 °C and 37 °C temperatures for 7 days. In some cases
the incubation period was increased up to several weeks to observe the formation of
sclerotia, cleistothecia, etc. as per requirement. Morphological and microscopic
characteristics were compared to the characters given in manuals. For microscopic
observations high quality compound microscope equipped with objectives in range of 10X
to 100X oil immersion was used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Almost all (98%) of the cultures revived and sporulated well on media. It is clear
from the taxonomic studies that there were little variations in microscopic characters,
while there were marked variation in many cases in the characteristic exudates from the
colonies and the soluble pigments in the agar plates. A list of principal differences noted
from the type description given in the manuals is given below in Table I for the sake of
brevity#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]
[@Low temerature storage of ampoules had been advocated for the longevityy of the
cultures and 4 °C seemed to be the beer (Hacky, 1978). Earlier Mehrotra and Hesseltine
(1958) had reported that lyophilized cultures stored in a refrigerator for 15 years were
found to be more or less stable. At CMI the ampoules were stored at between 15 and
20 °C and fungi survived over 15 years (Smith, 1983). Our results show that the
lyophilized cultures can endure even high and fluctuating temperatures without losing
their viability.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It can be concluded that lyophilization of cultures and their subsequent uncared
storage for more than 35 years at room ensure does not bring material change in the
morphological characters of Penicillia but it does bring certain cultural
changes e.g. in the production of soluble pigr and exudates or slight change in the
texture of colony.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Andalusia region is located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula,
occupying an area or about 87.000 km*, including eight provinces (Almeria,
Cadiz, Córdoba, Granada, Huelva, Jaén, Málaga and Sevilla)-see nap-. It shows
an enormous ombroclimatic variability (five different types of ombroclimate
can be identitied: semiarid, dry, subhumid, humid and hyperhumid); the same
applies to its thermoclimate (with five types too: thermo-, meso-, supra-,
oro- and crioro-mediterranean); these factors give rise to an extremely
diverse vegetation, with more than 3.000 species of vascular plants
catalogued (Valdés, 1993). The Andalusian vascular flora is typically
mediterranean and many species are common in northern Africa, though part
of its vegetation has a difterent origin having reached the region through
other migratorian pathways.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Io understand the ecological behaviour of many ectomycorrhizal agarics
in Andalusia, a short comment about the plant-communities which have been
studied by us seems necessary. First, the cork-oak (Quercus suber) forests
or “alcornocales", mainly Jocated in western Andalusia (Cádiz, Huelva, Málaga
and Sevilla), are characterized by a subhumid ombroclimate, lack of frost
periods in winter and siliceous substrate, Q. suber being the dominant
plant, accompanied by others such as Q. canariensis, Q. faginea, Q. ilex

[@river banks, are commonly formed by caducicolous plants with mesophytous
inclinations; among them we emphasize the alder (Alnus glutinosa)
communities or “alisedas", located in the stream proximities, with more
hydric requirements, and the poplar (Populus sps.) communities or
“choperas", which thrive in commonly flooded soils. The conifer vegetal
formations are mostly reafforested communities, traditionally favoured by
man with exploitation purposes. The most trequently used conifer species
are Pinus pinaster, P. nigra subsp. saizmannii, P. halepensis, P. sylvestris
and P, pinea; along with them, though vestigially, some representatives of
Cedrus, Cupressus, ..etc, may appear. Lastly, the Cistus bushes or "jarales"
constitute the most extended serial stage in the southern part of the
Iberian Peninsula, being more frequent in the provinces of Cádiz, Córdoba,
Huelva, Jaén, Malaga and Sevilla, developing on acid and poor soils, being
the most characteristic serial stage of the "alcornocales" and "encinares".
The main components are cístus ladanifer, C. laurifolius, C. monepeliensis,
C. populifolius, C. salvifolius,...etc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As for Inocybe in Andalusia, owing to this great floristic variability
and the interesting convergence of northernafrican and eurosiberian
elements in this region, many agaricologists have carried out mycological
studies, some or them including isolate records of Inocybe species; among
these, we can mention Varo & al. (1976), Calonge à Tellería (19805, Malencon
à Llimona (1980) and Ortega & Garcia-Buendía (1986). However, the first
monographic contribution tor the region was made by Ortega & Esteve-
Raventös (1989), with a total of 28 records of Inocybe taxa. All the taxa
reported in this paper are included in the subgenera Jnocybe, Inosperma
Kühner and Inocybivm (Earle) Sing.; up to now, taxa belonging to the
recently proposed subgenus Leptocybe T. Kobayashi (Kobayashi, 1993), have
not been either reported or described in the Iberian Peninsula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is dissapointing that in some very important monographical works
about Jnocybe in Europe (e.g. Heim, 1931; Kuyper, 1986), the Iberian taxa
belonging to this genus have not been either studied or do they receive
comment; the Andalusian records can  otfer a wider spectrum of
distributional parameters ot this genus between central and northern Burope
and North Atrica, where many new taxa probably remain undescribed (cf.
Malencon & Bertault, 1970). The aim of this check-list is to offer as much
infornation as possible and start to fill the existent gap in the knowledge
ot this genus in the "often rorgotten" Iberian Peninsula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The samples were studied under the light microscope using distilled
water, KOH 5%, Congo Red 2% and NHaOH 5%, measuring at least 20 spores
trom lamellae. All the material has been deposited and preserved at the
herbaria of Granada (GDAC) and Alcalá de Henares, Madrid CAH).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basically, we have followed the taxonomic treatment of Kuyper (1986)
and Stangl (1989), except where indicated; also, the contributions of
Malengon & Bertault (1970), where many Jnocybe species from Morocco are
studied, and Nishida (1989), which includes a practical key ot the species
from California are recommended, both introducing many typical species of
mediterranean character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following list of taxa includes synonyms of common use, reference
to all the material studied by us, previous records from the region and
taxonomical comments in the case of rare or problematical taxa or “species
complexes". We have strictly respected the taxonomic treatment of the
different authors who have reported Inocybe records in the region, but#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comment,- It seems to be a very common taxon under Cistus sps,, showing a vide range of
variability in some macroscopical characters, notably the color of the pileus and lamellae
and overall size, In Andalusia, there seems to be much intergradation among populations
and the yellow color ot the lamellae can be variable, even in the same collection, This
is why we do not consider this to be a good character, even at varietal level, and propose
the new combination for those populations showing a pallid to strong yellowish tint in the
lamellae and stipe, [his variability was already pointed out by Alessio (1984b) before,
when dealing with “the J, jutescens Velen, group".#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]



[@The four-celled more or less trapezium-shaped teliospores of Diabolidum
calliandrae are very distinctive (Figs. 1, 3, 4). Most often the four cells are arranged
in a plane (Figs. 1a-d), but in some spores the lower cells project, one back, one to
the front, from the plane of the trapezium (Fig. le). Despite careful examination of
the wall of the teliospores, germ pores could not be found. The ontogeny of the
teliospores could be reconstructed from different ontogenetic stages of the spores
(Figs. 2, 4). First two cells are cut off (Figs. 2a-b) from an elongated, slightly
inflated terminal hymenial cell by two oblique septa. The originating spore initials
divide to produce a four-celled stage (Figs. 2c-d). The upper cells differentiate
further into teliospore cells; the lower cells divide again giving rise to the lower
teliospores and the apical cells (Figs. 1a, 2e).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The telia of D. calliandrae are formed subcuticularly (Fig. 5). A distinctive feature
of the species is the formation of a rigid peridium (Figs. 5, 6). The peridium derives
from elongated cells which are formed early in the telial ontogeny. The outer
periclinal walls of these cells are thick and gelatinized (Figs. 5, 6). During the
development of the telia these cells die and almost vanish. Only the outer
periclinal walls remain and form the rigid peridium. A somewhat similar kind of
peridium formation has been illustrated by Cunningham (1889) for Ravenelia
sessilis Berk., and could also be found in R. pithecolobii Arthur and R. havanensis
Arthur (Berndt, unpublished). In these cases, however, the cuticle of the host just
sloughed off together with remnants of hyphae of the subcuticular mycelium; a
persisting peridium was not formed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pedicelate teliospores arise from a pseudo-parenchymatous hymenium of

[@host were penetrated by the parasite, and intracellular hyphae were formed within
the epidermal cells. Intracellular hyphae could also be found in the mesophyll cells
(Fig. 7).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Proximally the intracellular hyphae were septated and relatively broad. They
became thinner apically and branched into extremely fine, coiled processes
(Fig. 7). The parasitic interaction of the raveneliaceous rusts has not been studied
in much detail. Rajendren (1972) and Tyagi & Prasad (1972) investigated several
Ravenelia spp. Rajendren (1972) found that the parasitic mycelium of Ravenelia
sessilis Berk. and R. berkeley Mundk. & Thirumal. was strictly intracellular and did
not form haustoria. This type of interaction was also found in D. calliandrae. There
is considerable diversity of the parasitic interaction, however, within the genus
Ravenelia, and also species forming typical D-haustoria are known (Rajendren,
1972).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Systematic position of Diabolidium calliandrae. - D. calliandrae shares the
presence of apical cells with only a few other genera of rust fungi: These are
Anthomyces, Apra, Diabole, Dicheirinia, and Diorchidiella, all belonging to the
Raveneliaceae (Cummins & Hiratsuka 1983, Hennen & Freire 1979). Trachyspora,
also with an apical cell on the teliospore pedicel, does not belong in this family but
to the Sphaerophragmiaceae (Cummins & Hiratsuka, 1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Judging from the teliospore characters and the subcuticular ontogeny of the telia,
Diabolidium most probably belongs to the Raveneliaceae. As pycnidia have not yet
been found, a more definite assignment is not possible.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Delimitation of the genus. - Diabolidium calliandrae can be distinguished easily
from the monotypic genera Diorchidiella and Apra whose species have two-celled
teliospores. The teliospore cells of Apra bispora are not laterally joined and have
separate apical cells. The single species of the genus Anthomyces, A. brasiliensis
Dietel, has smooth teliospores and is probably close to Dicheirinia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Diabolidium appears to be related most closely to the genera Diabole and Dicheiri-
nia, considering the overall similarity of their teliospores. There are, however, im-#Misc-exposition*]

[@*The observations concerning the pores are contradictory: Arthur (1922) described
ME germ-pore "in upper part of cell". Cummins (1935) could not definitely
establish the site of the pores but assumed two pores in a subequatorial position.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Diabole, with the single species D. cubensis Arthur, the telia develop
subcuticularly and are non-paraphysate as in Diabolidium calliandrae. The telia do
not have a peridium, however, and soon become naked. In contrast to Diabolidium,
the teliospores arise in pairs on a single apical cell. Usually only one pair is present,
but up to four pairs have been observed (Arthur 1925).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Diabolidium calliandrae differs from Dicheirinia spp. by several characters:
(1) Arrangement of teliospores. - D. calliandrae invariably has four-celled teliospo-
res with seriate teliospore cells, i. e. they are arranged more or less in a row. In
Dicheirinia spp. the teliospore heads are two-celled, three-celled or rarely four- to
eight-celled (D. spinulosa (Baxter) Hennen & Cummins, comp. Hennen &#Misc-exposition*]
[@270#Misc-exposition*]

[@the species with more than two teliospores per head the spores are not seriate. (2)
Number of apical cells. - In Diabolidium calliandrae there are always two
teliospore cells per apical cell. In Dicheirinia the number of teliospore cells
normally equals the number of apical cells. In D. ormosiae (Arthur) Cummins,
however, the two-celled teliospores are borne on a single apical cell, and the three-
celled teliospores of D. guianensis are sometimes borne on two apical cells
(Cummins 1935). Because of this variability of the number of apical cells, the
seriate arrangement of the teliospores in Diabolidium calliandrae appears to be the
most important telial character for a separation of the genus. (3) Peridium forma-
tion. - The telial peridium of D. calliandrae may serve as a further important deli-
miting character, as formation of peridia has never been observed in Dicheirinia.
(4) Position of the telia. - In contrast to the subepidermal telia of all known Dichei-
rinia spp., the telia of Diabolidium calliandrae are subcuticular in origin. Possibly,
this is not an important character for generic delimitation, as also in the genus Ra-
venelia species with subcuticular or subepidermal telia/uredia are found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction:#Misc-exposition*]

[@A review of the literature reveals over 400 fungal taxa associated with
Cannabis substrate. Many names among the 400 taxa represent obligate or
facultative taxonomic synonyms. For instance, the fungus causing gray mold
appears in the Cannabis literature under seven different names: Botryotinia
fuckeliana, Sclerotinia fuckeliana, Botrytis cinerea, Botrytis infestana,
Polyactis infestana, Botrytis felisiana,and Botrytis vulgaris. Similarly, fungi
causing foot rot, hemp canker, and charcol rot each appear under six names.
There are many others. Of course, not all taxonomists agree with ai/ these
synonyms, but most agree with most.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to these previously recognized synonyms, twelve additional
names are are reduced to synonyms of older taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

(Holmgren et al., 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fruiting bodies in voucher specimens were dislodged from host tissue with
dissecting needles and rehydrated in 3% KOH, then measured at their widest
part. They were either hand-sectioned with a razor blade or teased apart with
needles under a 4x objective. Material was stained with either cotton blue in
lactic acid or 196 phloxine in water (phloxine subsequently replaced with water
by capillary action under cover slips). Curved spores were measured along their
circumference, widths measured at their widest part, and means determined#Misc-exposition*]

correspond to D. arctii. (D. tulasnei Nitschke 1867 is probably a synonym of D.
arctii, but I haven't inspected Nitschke's type.) Another cause of Phomopsis
stem canker appears in the literature: P. cannabina Curzi 1927. But Curzi's
descriptions of pycnidia, A-conidia and 8-conidia seem distinct from the
anamorph of D. arctii. His type specimen is missing from the Pavia herbarium
(Dr.ssa V. Terzo, Curator, personal communication). No specimens exist at any

[@According to the original generic descriptions, Arthropsis (Sigler et al.,
1982) differs from Arthrographis Cochet ex Sigler & J.W. Carmich.
(1976) in being dematiaceous and having undifferentiated conidiophores
with distinct connectives between arthroconidia. Within the former,
however, some heterogeneity has been observed. The genus Arthropsis
includes species with slightly to strongly pigmented hyphae/arthroconidia,
and occasionally with a Humicola-synanamorph. Additionally, because of
incomplete information on the presence and ultrastructure of arthroconidial
connectives, van Oorschot & de Hoog (1984) found the distinction
between both genera to be vague and suggested that the majority of
Arthrographis species, except the type species, A. kalrae (Tewari &
Macpherson) Sigler & J.W. Carmich., should be transferred to
Arthropsis. Later, Malloch & Sigler (1988) and Sigler et al. (1990)
rejected this proposition. Our species adds some unusual characteristics to
the above mentioned heterogeneity such as fast-growing and strongly
tufted colonies in culture, and hyaline to subhyaline arthroconidia among
which high variability in size is seen. However, attending to the presence
of conidial connectives and the absence of differentiated conidiophores, we
think this species is closer to Arthropsis than Arthrographis. As it
appears, the concept of Arthropsis could accommodate all the present
species if conidial and mycelial pigmentation were excluded. Both
pigmented and non-pigmented conidial types occur in other arthroconidial
form-genera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Mycelium radicis atrovirens complex is a group of usually sterile
hyphomycetes associated with the roots of plants growing in cool, humus-rich
soils. Leptodontidium orchidicola is a relatively common, but poorly known,
species in this complex. The cultural and vegetative morphology of L. orchidicola
make it superficially similar to Phialocephala fortinii but differences are discernible
at the microscopic level. We have obtained in pure culture several sporulating
strains from alpine habitats in Alberta and have observed conidiogenesis using
light and scanning electron microscopy. Observations indicate that the single-
celled conidia develop blastically at non-specific loci along the lateral or terminal
walls of conidiogenous hyphae. Mature conidia are variable in shape and may
be sessile or short-stalked. Secondary conidia often develop blastically from the
distal end of undehisced primary conidia. When grown in axenic culture with
native host plants in the genera Picea, Betula and Potentilla, the fungus
penetrated and colonized epidermal and cortical cells but did not cause any
discernible pathogenic effects.#Abstract*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dematiaceous fungi are commonly isolated from roots of plants growing
in cool, humus-rich soils (Wang and Wilcox, 1985; Currah et al., 1987; Stoyke
and Currah, 1991; Stoyke et al., 1992; Currah and Tsuneda, 1993). Many of
these fungi are sterile or produce inconspicuous conidiogenous cells and conidia
that are easily overlooked. Melin (1922) grouped these dematiaceous root
associates under the name Mycelium radicis atrovirens (MRA). Three MRA taxa#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Phialophora finlandia, Chloridium paucisporum, and Phialocephala fortinii) were
described by Wang and Wilcox (1985) and a fourth Qorchidicola
Sigler and Currah) was described by Currah et al. (1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Leptodontidium de Hoog encompasses dematiaceous fungi
that produce conidia in a more or less sympodial order at the apex of
conidiogenous cells (de Hoog, 1977; 1979). The type specimen of L. orchidicola
was derived from an isolate from the root of a native Alberta orchid, Platanthera
(L.) Lindl. This fungus has been reported from the mycorrhizas of
a wide range of terrestrial species of Orchidaceae. Ultrastructurally, L. orchidicola
has a simple septum with single central pore flanked on either side by Woronin
bodies which indicates that it is ascomycetous (Currah and Sherburne, 1992).
Currah et al. (1987) noted that among the species of Leptodontidium, conidium
development in L. orchidicola is most similar to L. boreale and L. obscurum.
Phialocephala fortinii resembles L. orchidicola in cultural (refer to Figs. 1 and 2)
and vegetative morphology but conidiogenesis in the former involves incubation
in the cold for about 3 months and formation of phialides with the subsequent
release of dimorphic conidia. The vegetative and reproductive morphology of P.
fortinii has been characterized by Currah and Tsuneda (1993) but similar work
with L. orchidicola has not been done.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The objectives of this study were to: (1) characterize conidiogenesis of L.
Qrchidicola using light and scanning electron microscopy; (2) make an initial
assessment of its ecological niche by observing its effect on some host plant
species when grown together in axenic culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Provenance for the strains of L. orchidicola is provided in Table 1. Strains
were grown on corn meal agar (CMA) at 23?C in a dark incubator. Specimens
from 2 strains (UAMH 5422 and F-AaN1a) were prepared for SEM following the
procedure of Currah and Tsuneda (1993) and examined with a Cambridge

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Light and scanning electron microscopic observations of the eight isolates
of L. orchidicola indicate that single-celled conidia develop blastically in an
apparently random pattern along the lateral and terminal walls of hyaline or
pigmented conidiogenous hyphae (Figs. 3-13). ^ Swollen or unswollen
conidiogenous cells may also occur on the same hyphae or on short lateral
branches (Fig. 9). Lateral conidia are mostly solitary (Figs. 3-11) and terminal
conidia may also be solitary (Fig. 13) but are often in clusters produced
sympodially (Figs. 3-5, 8, 9 and 12). The production of solitary lateral conidia on
conidiogenous hyphae is a characteristic of L. orchidicola and makes this species
distinct from others in the genus (Currah et al., 1987). In the early stage of
conidiogenesis, lateral conidia are observed more often than the terminal
sympodial type. Strains that produce few conidia, i.e., UAMH 5420, F-PsN4A,
and Z45.OR.a(2), rarely form clusters of terminal sympodial conidia whereas
strains that sporulate more abundantly, i.e., Z63.NR.2A, UAMH 5422, and
Z107.Rh.a, often produce clusters of terminal sympodial conidia. As observed
in slide cultures, the onset of conidiogenesis in these more prolifically sporulating
isolates is within 7 to 9 days.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mature conidia are 1 - 3 x 3 - 6 µm and may be globose, subglobose,
ellipsoidal, oval, ovate, obovate, pyriform, clavate, or spathulate (Figs. 3-13).
Each one of the isolates of L. orchidicola exhibits most or all of the different
shapes. However, a particular shape can predominate in some isolates, e.g., the
type UAMH 5422 has mostly pyriform (Figs. 3 and 7) whereas F-CxN1A most
often has globose to subglobose conidia (Figs. 4, 6, and 9). The conidia are#Description*]
[@290#Misc-exposition*]

[@mostly sessile but some have short stalks (Fig. 10). Some conidia are able to
form secondary spores (Figs. 3, 6 and 7). These are formed blastically, usually
on the apex of existing conidia, and are morphologically similar to the parent
conidium.#Description*]

[@The liberation of conidia may be schizolytic or by disintegration of the stalk
or part of the subtending structure (Fig. 13) leaving indistinct scars. Detached
conidia were rare; this is another characteristic of L. orchidicola which
distinguishes it from other species of Leptodontidium (Currah et al., 1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidiogenesis in Leptodontidium is similar to that of Rhinocladiella Nannf.
‘sensu stricto, Acrodontium de Hoog, and Ramichloridium Stahel ex de Hoog but
the conidia of the latter genera are borne on denticles (de Hoog, 1977).
Leptodontidium aciculare Rao and de Hoog is the only reported species of the
genus which produces conidia on minute denticles but is different from the
above-mentioned genera on the basis of its formation of hyaline and often
intercalary fertile apparatus in later transfers (Rao and de Hoog, 1986).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In axenic culture, L. orchidicola formed associations with the roots of
seedlings from three different plant taxa studied. Leptodontidium orchidicola
invaded the proximal region of the roots, specifically the cortical and epidermal
areas. A network of intra- and intercellular hyphae formed throughout the
epidermal and cortical areas of Picea glauca roots after 46 days. With seedlings
of Potentilla fruticosa, intracortical branched, swollen and lobed fungal cells were
observed after 54 days (Fig. 14). In Betula pumila intracellular sclerotia filled some
cortical cells within 64 days (Fig 15). These structures formed by L. orchidicola
on the roots of P. glauca, P. fruticosa, and B. pumila were morphologically similar#Misc-exposition*]

[@to those formed by P. fortinii on the roots of Menziesia ferruginea as reported by
Stoyke and Currah (1993). The presence of L. orchidicola in and on the roots
did not inhibit root elongation and it did not have any apparent effect on seedling
growth and survival. Currah et al. (1990) observed no indication of pathogenicity
in orchids colonized by this root endophyte in nature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leptodontidium orchidicola produces polyphenol oxidases, the group of
enzymes produced by white rot fungi which are involved in the breakdown of
lignin. The presence of these enzymes is manifested by a dark brown to almost
black zone around the plug of fungal mycelium on tannic acid medium within 24
hours (Davidson et al., 1938). Hutchison (1990) reviewed the possible ecological
significance of polyphenol oxidase production in fungi, particularly laccase.
Besides lignin breakdown, an indicator of potential saprobic ability, it could also
function in confering resistance to antifungal phenolic compounds. Such
compounds are apparently found in the humus layer of certain soils and also
produced by the roots of trees as defense barriers. The aforementioned
significance of polyphenol oxidase is in agreement with the report of Currah and
Tsuneda (1993) regarding the relationship of polyphenol oxidase production in
P. fortinii and its specialized niche as a root-dwelling fungus. Since they are both
commonly isolated from roots of plants in alpine and subalpine habitats, L.
orchidicola and P. fortinii may share a similar ecological niche.#Misc-exposition*]

[@REMARKS: Because it lacks cystidia, P. andreae belongs in subgenus
Phanericium Parm. of Phanerochaete. It is distinguished by its broad
subicular hyphae, mostly encrusted, subhymenium of a textura
intricata-porrecta and large basidia. It is closely related to Phanerochaete
bubalina Burdsall, also known only from the Canary Islands (Tenerife),
and P. aurata (Bourd. & Galzin) Burdsall, from France and South Africa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phanerochaete bubalina differs from P. andreae in its thinner, grayish
yellow basidiome, its smooth subicular hyphae mostly less than 6 µm
diam, with slight wall thickening; by subhymenium with textura porrecta
of short celled narrow hyphae (2.5-3.5 µm); and in smaller basidia (30-42
X 7-9 µm). The hymenial surface of P. bubalina also differs in its nearly
smooth hymenial surface with scattered small tufts of Hyphodontia-like
teeth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phanerochaete aurata posses non agglutinated subicular hyphae near the
substrate; a subhymenium of textura porrecta, short celled, narrow hyphae
(4-5 µm); and smaller basidia (25-40 X 6-8.5 µm), with sterigmata 3-4 µm
long. The basidiome is frequently less than 300 µm thick.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, the basidiospores of the three species are nearly similar in shape

[@TAXONOMY OF SOME ARGENTINE SPECIES
OF SACCOBOLUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Maria E. Ranalli and Oscar A. Mercuri#Misc-exposition*]
[@Departamento de Ciencias Biológicas, Universidad de Buenos Aires
Ciudad Universitaria, 1428 Buenos Aires, Argentina#Institution*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nine Saccobolus species with 100 isolates from diverse locations of Argentina were
analysed on the basis of morphological and cultural characters, using either ordination or
sequential techniques. The results support the classical speciation of Saccoboius based on
morphology of reproductive structures, and show that the nine studied species are clearly
independent taxonomic entities.#Abstract*]

[@Key words: Saccobolus, taxonomy, factor analysis, cluster analysis, Argentina.#Misc-exposition*]
[@316#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@When Boudier (1869) established Saccobolus, the presence of a common
mucilaginous hyaline sack around the ascospores was considered one of the
major criteria. Although this mucus occurs only in a limited number of
species, many authors have maintained it as the most important
distinguishing character. Brummelen (1967) characterized the genus within
the subfamily Ascoboloideae as producing clustered ascospores, relatively
short and broad, clavate, truncate asci, and relatively short paraphyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nine species in the current report were thoroughly studied previously for
ascocarp development and cytology of the ascus (Gamundi & Ranalli, 1969;
Ranalli, 1974; Ranalli & Gamundi, 1975; Ranalli & Forchiassin, 1976;
Dokmetzian et al., 1986; Ranalli & González Castelain, 1994; Mouso &
Ranalli, 1986; Forchiassin & Dokmetzian, 1982), and for diverse phisiological
purposes (Mercuri & Forchiassin, 1978; Galvagno et al., 1984: Ramos,
1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The use of numerical methods to solve taxonomic problems appears to be
an excellent tool since the pioneering reports of Sneath & Sokal (1962),
resumed later in two admirable books (Sokal & Sneath, 1963; Sneath &
Sokal, 1973).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study aimed to find additional diagnostic characters, other than
classic morphology, for a group of Saccobolus species, using either
ordination (Factor analysis) or sequential (Cluster analysis) techniques to
determine the taxonomic structure.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Factor analysis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Data matrix were computed to obtain a correlation matrix from which
principal components were extracted. Orthogonal rotation (gamma = 1) of
the correlations of the principal components with the original variables were
performed. Estimated factor scores and Mahalanobis distances were
obtained. The factor score covariance matrix, recomputed using the factor
scores, serves as a check for numerical accuracy. Then, the factor scores
were plotted one against the other.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Factor analysis were performed using the BMDP (Multivariate Analysis)
statistical package (Dixon, 1981)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cluster analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Manhattan metric distance coefficient (Rohlf & Sokal, 1965) were computed
for each pair of species in the standarized data matrix, and the resulting
matrices were analysed by average linkage cluster analysis (UPGMA)
(Sneath & Sokal, 1973).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The goodness of fit of the phenogram was examined on the basis of
cophenetic matrix computed from the tree matrix, with similarity matrix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Factor Analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nine species of Saccobolus studied can be distinguished by factor
analysis. The model fit the data satisfactorily since the variance explained by
the first four factors was 81.4 % of the total variance (The first seven factors
explain the 100 % of the total variance in the data space).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The factor 2 provides a cleary discrimination between two groups of species
(A, B) (Figure 1). The colour of apothecia and paraphyses, and the spore
pack characteristics loads the 78.4 % of the variance explained by factor 2
(Table III).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological and cultural characters were used by Gamundi & Ranalli

characters as apothecial morphology or distribution in culture showed poor
contribution to the explained variance as discussed previously.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The other five species are grouped in section Saccobolus. S. saccoboloides,
S. platensis and S. longevisporus clustered closely together (Figure 1, B1;
Figure 5). Morphological differences among these species are subtle at best.
However, based on ascopore germination characteristics, the three species

[@Remarks.--The color and form of the teeth of P.
fascicularia are quite distinctive but variable and
difficult to describe (Figs. 5-6). Fresh specimens
often develop a violet or purple coloration and are
distinctly gelatinous. Hyphae and hymenial elements
cannot be separated as they are embedded in a clear,
gelatinous matrix. Specimens that develop only warts
are phenotypically similar to Phlebia livida (Fr.)
Bres. Although the basidia of P. fascicularia are only
half as long as most phlebias, other features, such as
the thickening subhymenium, ceraceous texture, and
cultural traits, are typical of true phlebias.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After studying and describing the isotype specimen
of Hydnum fascicularia, Gilbertson (1965) placed it in
synonymy with Hydnum stenodon Pers. (- Mycoacia aurea
(Fr.) Erikss. & Ryv.). Although basidiospores of the
two taxa are similar in size, those of H. stenodon are
typically curved, in contrast to the straight spores of
H. fascicularia. In addition, the teeth of H.
fascicularia are coarse and unlike the very slender
teeth of H. stenodon.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Examination of type specimens confirms that Radulum
vinosum is conspecific with H. fascicularia. There is a
specimen of Hydnum fasciculare Berk. & M. A. Curtis in

[@Remarks.--Phlebia setulosa is easily recognized
because of the pubescent teeth, encrusted cystidia, and
relatively large spores. Although locally abundant, it
is not common. The cystidia of the tooth axis may
resemble skeletal hyphae, thus P. setulosa was placed in
the genus Steccherinum and later in Hyphodontia.
However, cultural and molecular evidence suggest that
the correct placement of this species is in Phlebia
(Nakasone, 1990a, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

is known only from Louisiana. It was first described by
Overholts (1938) as Odontia brunnescens; because a Latin
description was lacking, the name is invalid. The even,
small warts and heavily encrusted, embedded cystidia are
diagnostic for this taxon. However, the cystidia are
fragile and easily destroyed in squash mounts. At
times, the embedded encrusted cystidia appeared to be#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phlebia is poorly defined and delimited (Eriksson,
et al., 1981), and the limits of the genus are still
being explored. Species of Phlebia are characterized by
ceraceous texture, thickening subhymenium, clamp
connections, narrowly clavate basidia, and hyaline
spores and are associated with white-rot decay. In pure
culture, phlebias grow rapidly and develop broad,
simple-septate hyphae in the margin from which nodose
Sepate branches arise and proliferate (Boidin, 1964;
Nobles, 1958; Stalpers 1978). Some species described
herein challenge this traditional concept of the genus.
For example, P. floridensis lacks clamp connections in
the basidiocarp. All species of Phlebia, except for P.
Geflectens (Karst.) en are regularly nodose septate.
Culturally, however, P. floridensis displays typical
Phlebia features, SXGEBE that regularly clamped hyphae
are lacking.  Phlebia nanthaliensis is very thin and
lacks a distinct, thickening subhymenium that is
characteristic of phlebias. Similarly, the gerieric
placement of P. hydnoidea has been questioned.
Gilbertson (1971) suggested that this taxon could be
placed in Steccherinum, but Ginns (1970) saw some
resemblence to Veluticeps. However, preliminary
sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer
region of the ribosomal DNA repeat suggest that P.
hydnoidea, P. floridensis, P. nanthaliensis, and P.
Setulosa belong to Phlebia sensu stricto (Nakasone,
1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species of the genus Phellinus Quelet
actively degrade lignin and cellulose, causing a
white-rot of wood, both in living trees and woody
debris. It is a large genus distributed principal
ly in tropical regions (Larsen & Coobb-Poulle,
1990; Ryvarden & Johansen, 1980).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fundamental characteristics that distin
guish the genus within the family Hymenochaetaceae
are the dimitic hyphal system (Cunningham, (1947)
and the rigid basidiome (Ryvarden, 1991). Phellinus
is very similar to Inonutus Karsten, and at times
they are difficult to separate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spore colour, a distinctive feature original
ly used by Bourdot & Galzin, was completely aban-
doned by Fiasson & Niemela (1984) who emphasize
that the only differential character between Phe-
llinus and the other genera is dimiticy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Island of Santa Catarina, there was
no record of species of this genus for about hund

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The specimens studied were collected on the
Island of Santa Catarina, twice per year (summer

de Federal de Santa Catarina, Brasil) and BAFC
(Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina) were stud
ied. Herbaria abbreviations follow Holmgren & Keu

[@For the taxonomic study mecro-and microsco
pical features were analysed, including general
aspect, pore size in mm, and basidiome color.
Colors are those of Munsell (1975). Microscopic
preparations were mounted in 5% KOH, 1% aqueous
solution of phloxine, Melzer's reagent (Singer,
1949) and lactophenol cotton-blue (Kotlaba & Pouzar

spores and setae of similar shapes and sizes. For
this reason we considered it valid. Larsen & Lom-

the nomenclature and types of these two species,

[@Remarks: The species is very similar to P.

effuse-reflexed basidiomes and grows on living
conifers (Gilbertson, 1979). Its resemblance to
the P. robustus complex was noted by Lowe (1966)
and Gilbertson (1979). The former author considers
the present species to be a resupinate form of P.
robustus (Karst.) Boud. & Galz., which is pileate.
Larsen & Cobb-Poulle (1990) in their survey of
the genus Phellinus considered P. punctatus (Fr.
ex Karst.) Pilat as a valid name for the species.
Ryvarden (1981) stated that the original spithet
was published as P. punctatus Jungh. (-Rigidoporus
lineatus) in 1838, whereby P. punctatus Fr. pu-
blished in 1874 is a later homonym and illegitima
te. However, according to Ryvarden (1991, p. 314)
Karsten in 1882 erected the binomial Poria puncta
ta, which should be the basionym for the , present
taxon, namely Ph. punctatus (Karst.) Pilat. We
have adopted Ryvarden's criterion of using the
latter authorship for the binomial.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@The monotypic genus Calbovista was originally published invalidly (Morse 1935),
lacking a Latin description. Herein is provided the necessary Latin for both the genus
and species thus validating these taxa. A brief discussion is presented regarding
relations at the generic level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Calbovista is a well known monotypic puffball genus of higher elevations,
occurring in the western mountains of North America following snowmelt. The
known distribution includes the following mountain ranges: Cascades, Sierra Nevada,
Olympics, Rocky Mountains and mountains of northern Idaho. Originally published
in 1935 by Elizabeth E. Morse, the genus is invalid due to the absence of a Latin
diagnosis. According to the International Code of Botanical N 1 (Greuter et
al. 1988), the name of à new taxon published on or after 1 January 1935, must be
accompanied by a Latin description (article 36.1). The necessary Latin diagnoses are
supplied herein, thus validating the previously described monotypic genus. Calbovista
has been exclusively used for this taxon by various workers during the past 60 years
(Seaver & Shope 1935; Zeller 1947, 1948, 1949; Smith 1963, 1975; Miller 1977;
Smith, Smith & Weber 1981; Lincoff 1981; Arora 1986; McKenney & Stuntz 1987;
McKnight & McKnight 1987; Miller & Miller 1988; States 1990, Kreis] 1992), thus
the name will be conserved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type specimens are deposited at the University of California, Berkeley Herbarium
(UC1). Microscopic examinations involved sections mounted in water, 3% potassium
hydroxide solution and Melzer's reagent (I5KI in chloral hydrate solution).#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Morse (1935), the original description was based on a composite
which she collected between May 7-23, 1934. Type material was deposited in the UC
herbarium as no. 525436. Handwritten on the outside of this boxed collection are the
following notes: collected by W. H. Sanders at railroad staion close to summit; det.
E. E. Morse; type. It does not appear to be a composite as stated in the 1935 (Morse)
publication. After examination of this material, the Sanders collection UC 525436,
was chosen as the type for this taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments. The genus Calbovista is characterized by a two layered, thick peridium,
the exoperidium breaking up into blunt, truncate, pyramidal warts, the presence of a
large sterile base, and branched capillitium which lacks perforations and has pointed
apices. As Morse originally stated (1935), the name Calbovista suggests alliance with
Calvatia, Bovista and Bovistella. The peridium is similar to Calvatia, yet the
capillitium of Calbovista sets it apart by having short, tapered to pointed, small side
branches, and is never perforated. The deep, sterile, rooting base and the capillitium
of discrete units compares closely with Bovistella, but the endoperidium of Calbovista
lacks a pore, is not tough in consistency, nor metallic or silvery in coloration. The
branched capillitium resembles that of Bovista, Bovistella and Mycenastrum. Bovista
differs by lacking a sterile base, possessing a fragile exoperidium that eventually
sloughs off, and the basidiome becomes detached from the substrate at maturity.
Mycenastrum differs by having a smooth exoperidium, an inner peridium which splits
stellately at maturity (Zeller 1949), and intricately branched capillitium with multiple,
terminal spine-like processes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alexander H. Smith (1965) described a variety, C. subsculpta var. fumosa, based
primarily on the gray coloration of the outer peridium and the formation of very
rudimentary squamules. This infraspecific taxon is only known from the type
locality, and certainly warrants further study to determine its proper placement.
However, it is invalid since it was based on an invalid genus name.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Calbovista has been placed in the family Lycoperdaceac, order
Lycoperdales by various workers (Kreis! 1992; Miller & Miller 1988; Smith, Smith
& Weber 1981). Other workers have placed Calbovista in the Mycenastraceae along
with Mycenastrum (Zeller 1948, 1949). Zeller (1948) erected the family
Mycenastraceae to include Calbovista and Mycenastrum, which is united by the
presence of capillitial threads having short, spine-like or pointed side branches. There
has been no conflicting publications regarding where Calbovista belongs at the ordinal
level. There is some question as to which family it belongs, but recent workers place
it in Lycoperdaceae. With the advent of molecular techniques, perhaps a better idea
of its relations to other bers of the Lycoperdales can be established#Misc-exposition*]

[@Niebla tuberculata is characterized by: 1) being saxicolous; 2) having
terminal/sub-terminal + marginal apothecia on angular to flattened, or terete
branches; 3) having uniseptate spores straight to gently curved, 11-14 µm x 3-5 µm;
4) being isidiose-papillate, the papillae often developed upon tubercules and
conspicuously tipped with black pycnidia; 5) possessing a central mass or thickened
strands of agglutinated hyphae; 6) a triterpenoid chemistry lacking diterpenes,
depsidones, and para or meta-depsides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Niebla combeoides (Nyl.) Rundel and Bowler, and Desmezieria ceruchoides
Follm. and Hun. (a nomen nudum that will be redefined in the near future; Bowler
et al, in prep.) are other saxicolous species with terminal and/or sub-terminal
apothecia with terete to angular branches that might be confused with N. ruberculata.
These taxa produce floccose deposits that extrude between cracks in the cortex with
age. The mold-like appearance of this deposit has been attributed to the presence of
ceruchdiol (Bendz et al., 1965), a diterpene that is absent or the concentrations too
low to be detected by TLC in N. tuberculata. Also, neither of these taxa produces
isidiose-papillae that are characteristic of N. ruberculata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Niebla combeoides is-also easily separated by the absence of a coalesced
central mass of chondroid strands, the common occurrence of terminal apothecia
(usually one per blade) on unbranched stalks, different chemotypes including the#Misc-exposition*]

[@content of + salazinic acid + zeorin, and a rugose cortex. Otherwise N. combeoides
also has a similar thickened cortex much like that of N. tuberculata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Desmezieria ceruchoides is an easily recognized taxon, and is distinguished
from N, tuberculata by its caespitose habit that lacks a distinct holdfast, and bifurcate
branched apices; it is rarely fertile having spores 10-13 µm x 3-4 µm. Bush-like
morphologies of D. ceruchoides may superficially resemble N. ruberculata but lack
its roughened papillate cortex and more strongly flattened branches.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Niebla robusta (R.H. Howe) Rundel and Bowler also occurs within the
saxicolous community in this region of the Pacific fog-belt and is identified readily
by its squat, inflated branches, terpenoid chemistry (including zeorin) + salazinic
acid, and shorter spores measuring 10-12 µm in length. Niebla robusta also lacks
the central strands of agglutinated hyphae found in N. tuberculata and has a puffy,
cottony medulla most similar to N. ceruchis (Ach.) Rundel and Bowler. Although
Howe (1913) considered N. robusta to be a variety of N. combeoides, the medullary
characteristics shared between N. robusta and N. ceruchis may reflect a closer
evolutionary relationship between these two species than previously considered.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is another locally common, but undescribed, saxicolous taxon with
slender tubular branches that also shares the same anatomical medullary
characteristics of the N. ceruchis-robusta group. It is readily distinguished by the
p of 1 of small apothecia and the usual content of
salazinic acid (Bowler et al., in prep.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The angular blade-like morphology of N. ruberculata, and the presence of the
central mass (often cord-like in larger branches) of agglutinated strands of hyphae
(interpreted as mechanical and moisture retention tissue) in N. tuberculata may imply
an evolutionary history allied to the hypothetical saxicolous Ramalinoid group
ancestral to Niebla previously postulated by Bowler (1981). Taxa of the Niebla
homalea group, also having angular to flattened blades, are recognized anatomically
by the presence of distinct chondroid strands in the medulla (Bowler 1981) which
serve as an aid in identifying immature specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Usnea subfusca Stirton also occurs in central California and may superficially
resemble N. ruberculata in having a central cord and a thallus deformed by isidiate
tubercules. It may be distinguished by its non-septate spores, a K+ medulla, and an
elastic central cord.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Niebla tuberculata is locally abundant above the supralittoral zone on the
fog- -shrouded sea cliffs and outcrops of Morro Rock Reserve. It has not been found

here on the mainland, but is to be expected on the Channel Islands. Other
California lichen endemics, such as Caloplaca brattiae W. Weber, exhibit a disjunct
distribution pattern that includes Morro Bay and the offshore Islands (Weber 1989).
Morro Rock (historically an island at the entrance to Morro Bay since the last glacial)
is an ancient volcanic plug 581 feet in height that has been dated at 22 million years
BP (Daughtery 1986). Niebla tuberculata and related taxa may be relicts
(paleoendemics) of moister climatic regimes occurring prior to the emergence of the
xeric Mediterranean type of climate in the mid-Miocene (Axelrod 1989), and may
now be restricted to mesophytic refugia. Stebbins and Major (1965) correlated the
presence of relict species occurring in California to mesic regions influenced by
relatively high warm season precipitation. The Morro Bay region has been
previously identified as an area commonly influenced by summer fogs and a refugia
for disjunct/relict lichen taxa (Riefner 1990), including narrow endemics such as the#Misc-exposition*]

Holubovä-Jechovä (1986) and E. dingleyae Hughes (1978) are slightly similar
to E. occidentalis because their conidia are 0-septate. However, the conidia of
E. dingleyae have roughened walls; in E. albiziae they are spherical or sub-

pileus surface is dry and pruinose to subtomentose, the stipe is finely
reticulate, and the basidiospores are 20-26 (28.6) X 9-10.4 (11) µm while

ovate, ellipsoid to oblong face view, somewhat inequilateral in profile,
measuring 9.5-18.9 (20) X 5.5-9.5 µm (Fig. 7), and the stipe becomes
finally glabrescent, without reticulation. A bolete with a volva is
uncommon. The genus Volvoboletus was described by P. Hennings (S.
Killermann, 1928), based on Boletus volvatus Pers. = Volvoboletus
volvatus (Pers.) Henn. but a type specimen is not extant. Singer (1986)
has reviewed this genus. The genus Paragyrodon (Singer) Singer has a
volva-like annulus which is viscid, white and membranous, but it does not
develop an obvious volva at the base of the stipe and thus is different
from G. doii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many new names of fungi recently proposed have been shown by
listings in the Index of Fungi to be not validly published under the
International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Unfortunately
many of these errors were committed by highly respected
mycologists, and published in thoroughly respectable journals.
Fourteen new generic names and 127 other new names not validly
published are analyzed. The reasons for rejection of these names are
primarily inattention to the details for valid publication spelled
out in that Code. Though the ultimate responsibility for publish-
ing correct names lies with authors, clearly reviewers and editors
are shirking their duties to advise authors of such errors prior to
publication. A few simple guidelines for authors, reviewers, and
editors are offered.#Abstract*]

[@KEYWORDS: Nomenclature, valid publication, new taxa, new
names, new combinations, authors, reviewers, editors#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE PROBLEMS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In my perusal of the most recent semi-annual issue of the Index
of Fungi (Anon., 1994) I was once again struck by the large
number of names being proposed that are either incorrect or, far
worse, not validly published. That publication performs an
exceptionally important service, not only in recording new taxa
as well as new names and new combinations for old taxa that are
published, some in obscure journals or books, but also in
pointing out such errors as the editors of that Index detect, and,
recently, in citing the specific Articles of the International Code
of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) (Greuter, & al. 1988) that
render such names "not validly published." In this article I have#Misc-exposition*]
[@414#Misc-exposition*]

[@used the Article numbers as they appear in the 1988 Code.
Readers should be aware that if they consult the newly published
Code (Greuter, & al. 1994) the Articles have been re-numbered
following Art. 50.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of the most common errors made is that the wrong Latin
termination is given, typically where a species epithet fails to
agree in gender with the generic name. This merely renders the
name incorrect, and a correction can be made (by anyone). From
the above-cited issue of the Index, thirty of the new taxa or new
combinations had such less than fatal flaws, and the corrections
and indication of the original misspellings were made there.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fatal flaws, however, result in names not being validly
published. For new taxa, the ICBN now has many specific,
detailed requirements which must be met before valid
publication can occur. Many of these requirements only apply to
names proposed after a specific date, while others are retroactive.
Almost everyone, for example, realizes that a new taxon of the
rank of family or below! is not validly published after
1.1.1935? without a Latin diagnosis or description. All old and
many more recent requirements apply to new taxa being
proposed now, the subject of this note. A particularly plaguing
problem is that when the type species of a new genus does not
meet all those requirements, the new generic name itself
becomes “not validly published.” One tiny misstep may doom a
new generic name and all its species and new combinations. I
noted fourteen generic names in that issue of the Index that fall
because of such fatal flaws, and briefly annotate them here, as a
series of case studies. All fourteen generic names fail because
their holotypes (i.e., type species) are not validly published, for a
variety of reasons. In some cases not only the generic name and
its holotype (HT) fall, but also all additional species, paratypes
(PT), fall as well, since the inverse also applies: a species cannot
be validly published if the generic name to which it is assigned is
not validly published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Seventeen names were indicated by their authors to be
provisional names (indicated by such notations as nom.
prov., ined., pro tem., etc.). Publication of such names
merely clutters the literature (Art. 34.1(b)).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eleven names lack the required Latin diagnosis or
description (Art. 36).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ten names involved incorrect designation of the type,
such as failure to designate a holotype or to use the word
typus or holotypus or its abbreviation or equivalent in a
modern language (Art. 37.4) or failure to cite the
herbarium in which the type is permanently deposited
(Art. 37.5), or the holotype collection was divided and both
parts were cited as type (Art. 9.1), or where a living culture
was cited as the type (Art. 9.5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two instances involve names deemed superfluous because
among the included elements was the type of a previously
published valid name that should have been adopted (Art.
63).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Later homonyms? (duplicate names based on different types)
caused publication of five illegitimate names (Art. 64):#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Three new taxa had names which were spelled exactly the
same as previously published names based on a different

type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Two new combinations resulted in names which were
exactly the same as names published earlier based on a
different type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SA problem I do not comment on in this note concerns publication of homonyms, i.c.,
names whose spelling exactly duplicate names published earlier with different types. In
nearly all such cases the fault lies with the author not knowing all of the available
literature. With literature so widely scattered this seems an almost insurmountable
problem, which now can often be caught by, e.g., the editors of the Index of Fungi, where
large databases are on hand. When a system of registration of new names is implemented
and the provision already in the Tokyo Code is activated, most such errors could possibly
be avoided. Though transfers of homonyms are normally prohibited, such “transfers” are
acceptable as new taxa with a new author citation inferred (see Art. 72, Note 1, and its
Examples 2 and 3). There seems little excuse for the publication today of homonyms of
names already recorded in, e.g., Saccardo's (1882-1966) Sylloge Fungorum or in
published issues of the Index of Fungi, inclusive of Petrak's Lists, two series hopefully
available to all serious mycological taxonomists.#Misc-exposition*]
[@417#Misc-exposition*]

[@New combinations and new names or new ranks for old taxa fall
into a slightly different category, for these of course do not
require a Latin description or diagnosis, yet they must meet
certain criteria of the ICBN. These errors appear in that issue of
the Index:#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Ten names that are superfluous combinations were noted,
where the same combination based on the same type had
been made earlier (in some instances even by the same
author).#Misc-exposition*]

[@An astonishing fifty-five names are invalid because of
failure to cite the basionym of the name correctly. (In all
fairness, it should noted that 39 of these are attributable to
one publication.) Article 33 of the Code thus appears to be
the major stumbling block producing invalid names. Typi-
cal causes are failure to cite the basionym at all, or if cited
missing part of that citation, such as author’s name, exact
place and date of publication including page or pages on
which the basionym appeared (or, in some cases, providing
too many pages, i.e., listing the full pagination of the
article rather than just the page or pages on which the
basionym was validly published; see footnote 1 to Art. 33).#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE SOLUTIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whose fault are such errors? Clearly the ultimate responsibility
lies with the authors of such names, who supposedly are
taxonomists cognizant of the rules of the ICBN. Obviously
many of our foremost taxonomists are not meticulous in
nomenclatural matters. It seems clear to me that since these
errors continue to be published, our journal and book review
processes can not be functioning correctly. Among the duties of a
reviewer of a taxonomic paper in which nomenclatural
novelties are proposed is, prior to accepting it, to check whether
the author(s) complied with the provisions of the ICBN. If a
reviewer lacks sufficient expertise, that person is surely the
wrong reviewer, and the choice of that reviewer by the editor
(or, in the case of Mycotaxon and a few other journals, by the
author) was wrong. If an editor is unaware of or inexperienced
with the rules, and relies only on reviewers to flag
nomenclatural mistakes, perhaps that journal ought to consider
ceasing publication of nomenclatural novelties (as, indeed, some
journals have wisely decided to do).#Misc-exposition*]

and to save the space used by correctly republishing invalid
names in later papers once the errors have been detected, I offer

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Previously only one location was known for Gyalidea in The
Netherlands (Brand et al. 1988). It concerns G. psammoica, found ten
years ago on the Wadden Sea Island Texel, were it was growing
terricolous in stable calcareous dunes. In the summer of 1993, during
an excursion in the province Noord-Brabant (The Netherlands), the
first author made several lichen collections from an old brick wall of
the monumental tower at Cuijk, including a Gyalidea, which appeared
to be unidentifiable with the recent key to the 24 known species
(Vézda & Poelt 1991). It was sent to the second author and after his
study and a comparison with the type-collection of G. hyalinescens, it
became clear that it represents a new variety. G. hyalinescens s.s. is
known in Europe from N. Scotland in the north to the French
Pyrenees in the south, the Azores in the west and Germany in the east
(Purvis et al. 1992). It occurs on basalt or siliceous rock in damp
habitats. The spores of this species are 3-septate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a study of lichens from Portugal, mainly from the province
Algarve, in the summer of 1993, the first author collected an
undescribed species of the genus Gyalidea. This very inconspicuous
lichen was collected from a trunk of A/nus glutinosa in a very shaded
situation, with only a few associated species. It seems to be the first
record of the genus Gyalidea for Portugal, since the synopsis by
Vézda & Poelt (1991), in which the known distribution for the genus
is given, includes no records from that country.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three new polypores are described from the Nothofagus forests of
Argentina. Aurantioporus albidus sp. nov. is associated with a white pocket
rot in standing and fallen trees of Nothofagus species and has effused-
reflexed, white, cartilagineous and thin fruitbodies composed of tightly
packed and clamped generative hyphae, and has broadly ellipsoid spores
with thickened walls. It is similar to Aurantioporus pulcherrimus (Rodw.)
P.K. Buchanan & I. Hood, a species known from Australia, New Zealand
and southem Brazil which grows on Eucalyptus and Nothofagus.
Compatibility tests between A. albidus and A. pulcherrimus are presented,
and the taxonomic circunscription of these species is discussed. Fomitopsis
minutispora sp. nov. is associated with a brown rot in Nothofagus alpina
and N. dombeyi. It is distinguished by effussed, effused-reflexed,
triquetrous or ungulate, perennial fruitbodies and small pores and spores.
Postia carbophila sp. nov. is a highly characteristic resupinate taxon
growing on fallen stems of charred Nothofagus species. Cultural characters,
nuclear behavior and mating systems are reported for A. albidus, F.
minutispora and P. carbophila.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the last four years the author has regularly visited the
Nothofagus forests of southern Argentina and collected wood-rotting fungi.
Several publications regarding new records of Polyporaceae (Rajchenberg#Misc-exposition*]
[@428#Misc-exposition*]

[@1993, 1994) have shown a richer flora than previously known from that
area (Wright & Deschamps 1972, 1975; Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1984;
Rajchenberg 1989). It is likely that more species will be found as these
forests are better surveyed. Wetter areas in the west, towards the border
with Chile, seem a reservoir of yet undetected taxa. In this work three new
polypores are described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic examination of fruitbodies was made from freehand sections
mounted in 5% KOH aqueous phloxine, Melzer's reagent, cresyl-blue (CrB) and cotton-
blue. Cultural features were studied and described according to Nobles (1965). The
species' code describing 6 wk old cultures follow the system of Nobles (1965), with the
modifications summarized by Nakasone (1990). The nuclear behavior (Boidin 1971)
was studied according to the staining procedure described by Boidin (1958). Color
names are in accordance with Munsell (1954). Herbarium abbreviations are according
to Holmgren & Keuken (1974), Compatibility tests were performed by confronting
selected single spore cultures representing mating types of one specimen with selected
single spore cultures representing mating types of a different specimen (Hallenberg
1984). Di x mono compatibility tests were also performed, consisting of the
confrontation of tissue/polysporic cultures of one specimen with monospore cultures of
a different species (Hallenberg 1984). Duplicates of specimens and cultures are
deposited at the author's laboratory. MR refers to collections and numbering made by
the author. CIEFAP/cc refers to cultures kept at the author's laboratory.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Selection of the holotype: Collection BAFC 33339 (MR 10696) was
chosen as holotype because it consists of a well developed, effused-
reflexed fruitbody. The other collections consist of either smaller, strictly
effused or only slightly reflexed fruitbodies. Thus, they were dismissed as
holotypes, even though the material was larger than in the holotype. Also,
there is a reference culture isolated from the holotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultural studies#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures studied (CIEFAP/cc): 120 (= BAFC 33338, from wood-rot), 111 (=

[@Microscopic characters: Margin of simple-septate generative hyphae,
4-8 µm diam., unbranched or scarcely so, with hyaline, thin walls in the
growing margin (Fig. 7) but become thickened to 3 µm or almost solid,
then appearing glossy (Fig. 8) behind the edge of the margin. These hyphae
lack septa at the growing margin but are simple-septate further back. They
give rise to thin-walled, simple-septate or falsely-clamped generative
hyphae, 1.5-4 µm; at about 2-4 cm from the margin, true clamps are formed
on the generative hyphae (Fig. 9). These generative hyphae are thin-walled
and (1)-1.5-4 µm diam. Clamped generative hyphae predominate as the mat
matures (Fig. 11), but simple-septate hyphae were still present at the end of
the study, even in the old areas around the inoculum. After the 4th week
there were clamped generative hyphae, 4-6 µm diam., with hyaline,
thickened, gelatinous and roughened walls (Fig. 10); their abundance varies
from one culture to another. Chlamydospores globose or ellipsoid, terminal
or intercalary, 7-15 x 5-12 µm, with hyaline, thickened walls (Fig. 12),
present throughout the dish but more abundant toward the inoculum.
Towards the end of the study the clamped generative hyphae may become
thick-walled (Fig. 14) or may produce wall thickenings in the clamp or
nearby (Fig. 13). Also, the simple-septate generative hyphae may exhibit
unevenly thickened walls, leaving a meandering lumen (Fig. 15). Cultures
did not fruit during the study but many of them fruited later. Regularly,
daedaloid or lanceolated hymenophores are formed and they may produce
thick spore prints.#Description*]

[@size in both species. Also the features of the hyphal construction are
similar, in both species the generative hyphae are thick-walled, strongly
agglutinated and embedded in a resinous-like substance. In A. pulcherrimus
this substance is orange, whereas in A. albidus it is uncolored.
Aurantioporus pulcherrimus is different from A. albidus in the following
macroscopic features:#Misc-exposition*]

[@a) Larger fruitbodies, up to 15 mm thick.#Misc-exposition*]

drying.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Having personally studied specimens of both taxa (Rajchenberg &

[@The results of MONO x MONO compatibility tests are presented in#Misc-exposition*]
[@Table I. The results of DI x MONO compatibility tests are presented in
Table II. Table III summarizes the results of Table | as percentages of
wholly positive, negative or partially positive results.
#Misc-exposition*]
[@The results of the compatibility tests show partial compatibility
between A. albidus and A. pulcherrimus. About 5596 of the confrontations
had stable clamps either in the confrontation line exclusively or in one of
the two partners only (i.e., only one of the mated strains was dikaryotized).
Stability of the clamps present only in the confrontation line was confirmed
by subculturing mycelia in a different test tube. The partial compatibility
shown by both taxa was enhanced by the fact that positive hemicompatible
results were obtained only after 10 weeks of confrontation. Prior checking
of clamps showed their incomplete development, i.e. did not fully replace
the monosporic strains and were restricted to a portion of the mycelium
only. This indicates a very slow rate of dikaryotization in hemicompatible
confrontations, as the growth velocity of all the cultures was rapid. Totally
positive results, i.e. with both partners totally dikaryotized, were obtained
in 6 weeks. Only 12.5% of the confrontations were totally positive. These
results support A. albidus as a distinct taxon at the specific level. The
common origin of 4. albidus and A. pulcherrimus or the derivation of A.
albidus from A. pulcherrimus seems evident.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results of confrontations between specimens from Brazil and New
Zealand are certainly puzzling (Table I). Here, a higher degree of totally
negative results and a similar degree of hemicompatible results were
obtained (Table II). This can certainly invalidate the previous interpretation.
The DI x MONO mating test results (Table II) were negative between the
polyspore cultures from Australia (CIEFAP/cc 81) and New Zealand
(CIEFAP/cc 80) and the monospore ones from Argentina. But they were
also negative between the New Zealand polysporic culture CIEFAP/cc 80
and the monosporic New Zealand cultures from CIEFAP/cc 82. On the
contrary, totally positive results were obtained between the Australian
polysporic culture and the monosporic cultures from New Zealand
(CIEFAP/cc 82).#Misc-exposition*]

[@hyphae and hyaline, smooth, ellipsoid spores. It differs by its thinner, white
fruitbodies and the thickened spore walls. The latter feature points towards
a relationship with Spongipellis Pat. Aurantioporus albidus, as well as A.
pulcherrimus, can 'technically' be incorporated in that genus on account of
their monomitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, the
associated white rot, the thick-walled, ellipsoid spores, bipolarity and
astatocoenocity (David, 1969b). Nevertheless, it is still debatable whether
to give more taxonomic weight to spore wall thickening or to fruitbody
construction. Jahn (1973) pointed out the differences between
Aurantioporus Murr., Hapalopilus Karst. and Tyromyces Karst., and
underlined the similar hyphal construction of the species he included in
Aurantioporus. He pointed out that the fruitbody coloration in A. croceus
was not the same as the one found in species of Hapalopilus, a genus
where A. croceus has generally been included (Domanski et al. 1973,
Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1986, Bernicchia 1990, Ryvarden & Gilbertson
1993). Instead, he pointed out the similarities with A. fissilis (Berk. &
Curt.) Jahn and A. alborubescens (Bourd. & Galz.) Jahn. Cultural features
of Aurantioporus, Spongipellis and Hapalopilus are similar and cannot be
used to distinguish between these genera. The same can be said regarding
their nuclear behavior and sexuality (David 1969a, 1969b, 1988).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species like A. albidus and A. pulcherrimus emphasize the difficulty
in determing their ‘proper’ taxonomic placement of some species. The
affinity between A. albidus and A. pulcherrimus, and the similarities of the
latter with A. croceus (Buchanan & Hood 1992) would lead us to include
all of them in Hapalopilus should Aurantioporus be neglected or
considered a synonym of Hapalopilus (Ryvarden 1991, Ryvarden &
Gilbertson 1993). If so, that genus would incorporate white and orange-
pink species that do not show the characteristic reaction on KOH.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally, the species in Aurantioporus can perhaps be related with
several tropical F/aviporus Murr. species (sensu Ginns 1980) which have a
monomitic hyphal system composed of tightly agglutinated, clamped
generative hyphae, i.e. Flaviporus venustus David & Rajchenberg (1985)

in having slightly thickened walls. Also, the fruitbody is cream colored and
much more cottony and fragile in consistency. It usually exhibits a mass of

[@From other species in Postia Fr., P. carbophila differs by the
combination of spore size, pore size, color of the hymenial surface,
fruitbody shape and attachment to the substrate, by the presence of a
resinous-like substance between the hyphae and/or the hymenial elements,
and the particular habitat and substrate. Cultures of this species are
remarkable for their extremely slow growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Postia carbophila has a distinct ecological niche, so far restricted to
old, burnt trunks of Nothofagus spp., and apparently requires undisturbed
and quiet conditions to fruit. The associated wood-rot is difficult to discern
in nature, as in most of the specimens studied the basidiomes were fruiting
on charcoal. Nevertheless, the associated brown wood-rot could distinctly
be checked in the trunk where the holotype was growing, and was
confirmed while studying its culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From a strictly morphological point of view P. carbophila could be
placed in Ceriporiopsis Dom. because of the presence of the resinous-like
substance that covers the vegetative and hymenial elements in the
fruitbody, the resupinate habit and the thin-walled ellipsoid to cylindric
spores. However, Ceriporiopsis species produce a white rot of wood.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Germinating ascospores of Cyclaneusma minus (Butin) Di Cosmo, Peredo and Minter
were found to form hyaline appressoria on needles of Pinus radiata D. Don and on glass
slides. Formation of appressoria, and ascospores with a mucilaginous coat or
appendages, are diagnostic characters for species of Rhytismataceae infecting conifers.#Abstract*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ascospores of species of Rhytismataceae which infect conifer needles, germinate and
form appressoria (Darker, 1932; Costonis, Sinclair & Zycha, 1970; Diwani & Millar,
1986: Osorio & Stephan, 1989). Species of Cyclaneusma DiCosmo, Peredo & Minter
are reported to be an exception. According to Karadzic (1981), ascospores of C. minus#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Address for correspondence.#Misc-exposition*]
[@456#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Butin) DiCosmo, Peredo & Minter germinate by means of one or more germ tubes
which penetrate the host through stomata without appressorium formation. Osorio &
Stephan (1989) reported that ascospores of C. minus did not produce appressoria when
germinated in vitro for 12-24 h. However, in the course of studies of needle cast caused
by C. minus on Pinus radiata D. Don we observed appressorium formation.#Misc-exposition*]



[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascospore inoculum of C. minus was obtained by incubating at 21°C symptomatic,
yellow-brown P. radiata needles inside moist chambers consisting of small plastic
containers lined with moist filter papers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Current year's shoots were cut from P. radiata trees, age eight years, in Sunny Corner
State Forest (33? 25' S 149? 43' E), brought to the laboratory on the same day, and then
stored in plastic bags at 4°C for not more than seven days. Undamaged healthy needle
fascicles were removed from current year's shoot internodes. To enhance the longevity
of the needles, the fascicular sheaths were not removed. Sheathed ends of the fascicles
were surface sterilized in 4% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min., then the entire
fascicles were washed thoroughly in tap water, rinsed in distilled water and blotted dry
on filter papers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Only one needle per fascicle was inoculated with C. minus ascospores. Using a
micropipette, one small drop of sterile distilled water was placed on the abaxial surface
of the needle. Ascospores of C. minus were discharged into this drop of water by
suspending a small portion of hymenium picked from a fresh mature apothecium.
When ascospores had been discharged (checked under a dissecting microscope at X40
magnification) the h was ed, and the i lation site marked
using indian ink. Inoculated needles were air dried at room temperature for 30 min.
then, with the inoculated surface facing upward, placed inside Petri dishes containing
sterile moist filter papers. The fascicles were incubated at 25?C in diffuse light.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Inoculated portions of the needles were excised, stained in 0.5% aqueous basic fuchsin,
rinsed in distilled water and examined using an incident light microscope at X200
magnification. Selected segments were processed for scanning electron microscopy.
The needle segments were fixed overnight in 3% glutaraldehyde in 0.025 M phosphate
buffer (pH 6.8). The fixed materials were rinsed with 3 changes of the same buffer
solution, then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol (30%, 50%, 70% ethanol). They
were usually stored in 70% ethanol for several days before being processed in a graded
acetone dehydration series (70%, 80%, 90%, then 3 changes of 100% acetone). The
samples were critical point dried using liquid carbon dioxide, coated with gold and
examined with a SEM at 12kV.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascospores of C. minus were discharged into a small drop of sterile distilled water
smeared onto a glass slide. The spore film was air dried at room temperature for
approximately 30 min. Each slide was then incubated at room temperature overnight
inside a 90 mm diameter plastic Petri dish. — Germinated spores were fixed by#Misc-exposition*]

for 10 min. and stained using the HCI-Giemsa method (Hrushovetz, 1956).#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascospores of C. minus have long anterior and posterior cells and a short middle cell.
Each cell of the spore has one nucleus. Spores germinated by producing usually one or
two germ-tubes, 1.0-2.5 µm diameter, from both or cither the anterior or posterior cell
(Fig. 1). They very rarely germinated from the middle cell whose nucleus appeared to
be more condensed and less active. Each germ-tube usually produced one or more side
branches. After the germ-tubes had grown 10-210 µm long, they ceased elongating and
their terminal ends started to swell (Fig. 1). The germ-tube remained aseptate, and the
nucleus of the germinated cell began to migrate slowly into the germ-tube (into the
older, leading germ-tube if more than one was produced by the cell) and then into the
swollen apex of the main branch (Fig. 1). A hyaline appressorium was formed as the
swollen apex containing the nucleus was delimited from the germ-tube by a septum (Fig.
1). Appressoria were usually clavate or spherical (Figs. 1, 2). All this took place
within 24 h from the time ascospores were discharged into water droplets on glass slides
or on pine needles. Wall thickening and melanization of the app µm was not
observed even after 3 weeks. After 24 h the nucleus in the middle cell usually broke
down into a faint chromatin mass which sometimes appeared to adhere to the cell wall
(Fig. 1). Occaisionally the nucleus of the middle cell migrated through the septal pore
and into one of the adjacent cells, whose nucleus had migrated into a germ-tube. What
happened to the nucleus then could not be determined.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the presence of free water seems to be essential for spore germination, too
much water caused germ-tubes to float and continue elongating without appressorium
formation. Germ-tubes of C. minus showed no affinity to stomatal openings and they
usually grew over them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Contrary to the results of other previously published studies we found ascospores of C.
minus to germinate and form appressoria in a similar manner to other conifer inhabiting
= of Rhytismataceae. Formation of appressoria seems to be a diagnostic character,
as important as a mucilaginous coat of appendages on the ascospores (DiCosmo, Nag
Raj & Kendrick, 1984), for this group of fungi. Among the conifer inhabiting
Rhytismataceae, the shape of the C. minus appressorium is most like that of species of
Lirula Darker and of Lophodermium juniperinum (Fr.) de Not. (Osorio & Stephan,
1989).#Misc-exposition*]



[@The pattern of behaviour of the nuclei in germinating ascospores of C. minus is rather
different to that observed in other species of Rhytismataceae where the nucleus divides
before a germ-tube develops (Osorio & Stephan, 1989). In C. minus, mitotic division of#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Australia, C. minus has been observed to be more prevalent on needles of P. radiata
growing in relatively dry sites than Lophodermium pinastri (Schrad. ex Hook.) Chev.
which is more abundant in moist sites (Stahl, 1966). Nuclear division in the maturing
rather than the germinating ascospore, and rapid formation of non-mclanised
appressoria can be interpreted as adaptations to more xeric environments.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the survey for soil-inhabiting keratinophilic fungi and related dermatophytes
in Agra soils, Microsporrum gypseum (Bodini) Guiart & Grigorakis was found to be the
most frequently occurring dermatophyte (Singh ef al., 1990). Several unusual strains of
this fungus were reported which differ from its type strain. An attempt was made to study
them in detail in order to have a better understanding of their taxonomy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The preliminary occurrence of this fungus in soil was confirmed under hand lens by
its development of typical macroconidia on different keratin baits. Existence of the spores
of this organism in soils suggests the possibility of the natural occurence of this
keratinophilic organism as a geophilic fungus which is acting as a source of infection for
man and animals.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These fungi were purified by transferring and maintaining them on suitable culture
media. It was observed that these strains exhibit different morphological and physiological

characters.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials and Methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@I. Morphological Characters:#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates of M. gypseum were grown on Sabouraud's Dextrose Agar medium
(Peptone-10g, Dextrose-40g, Agar 20g in 1 liter of Distilled Water) at 26° C.for 8-20 days.
During this growth period, these cultures were observed and their morphological characters
such as colony ch etc., were ded (Table 1 and Fig.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1). In the same way, certain physiological studies of these strains were also conducted as
explained below and the results were recorded in Table 2.#Misc-exposition*]



[@II. Effect of medium on the growth of M. gypseum isolates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultures of these strains were grown in different culture En Chicos Gelatin
medium, Richard's medium, Glucose Asparagine medium, Sabouraud's Dextrose
medium and Potato Dextrose medium) in order to find out their ie requirements.
Fifty ml of each of the above broth media were dispensed into 150 ml Erlenmeyer flasks
and sterilized at 15 Ib pressure for 15 min. Inoculum discs of 6 mm diameter were obtained
from 8 day old cultures of each M. gypseum strain from its growing margin. After
inoculation, the flasks were incubated at 28° C for 8 days. The flasks were taken out and
the contents were filtered through pre-weighed filter papers. The mycelial weight of each
fungus was obtained by subtracting the weight of the filter paper from the total weight.#Misc-exposition*]

[@III. Effect of M. gypseum isolates in colonizing and degrading human hair.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To confirm the keratinolytic nature of these strains, a new method explained by the
authors (Singh, et al., 1989) was employed. Each strain was inoculated from 8 day old
cultures grown on SDA in the middle of a sterile hair kept in a paired petri plate under
aseptic conditions. A small amount of cotton dipped in distilled water was spread at the
bottom of each glass rod to provide a humid atmosphere for the growing fungus. This
cotton would also act as a cushion for the glass rods and keeps them in position. The
whole assembly was kept in an incubator at 28° C for 20-50 days. The fungus developed a
colony on the hair and its growth continued. After a few days, the hair was broken at the
point of inoculation indicating the digestion of keratin of the hair and its disintegration by
the test fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@IV. Keratin Degradation by M. gypseum isolates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to measure the difference in their keratin degradation, the cultures were
grown in Sabouraud's Dextrose Broth medium with buffalo skin as a keratin source for 20
days through the "weight loss" method (Fergus, 1969). The keratin substrates were
cleansed by washing several times in tap water, cut into small pieces, washed with
chloroform and finally rinsed in sterile distilled water as also suggested by Weary, et al.
(1965). The substrates were sterilized by "dry-autoclaving" (Geetha Singh, 1981). An
aliquot of 30 ml of the above SD broth was taken into 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks. Two
hundred and fifty mg of sterilized keratin substrate was added into each flask and sterilized
at 15 Ib pressure for 15 min. The flasks were inoculated with an inoculum disc of 6 mm
diameter obtained from an 8 day old culture of the fungi and incubated at 28° C. for 20
days. In the same way, controls were run separately without adding the keratin substrate.
After 20 days, the flasks were harvested and the mycelial mats were removed and dried at
80° C. for 24 hrs. The keratinolytic activity was measured through the "weight loss”
methods described by Fergus (1969). The percentage weight loss of keratin materials by
each fungus was calculated against controls and the values were shown in Table 2.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultures of M. gypseum strains were grown in different culture media i in order
to find out their nutritional s Dx (SD) was p d most
followed by Glucose Gelatine medium (GGM), Potato Dextrose medium (PD), Richard's

[@III. Effect of M. gypseum isolates in colonizing and degrading human hair.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Activity of these strains on human hair was found to be different by the use of a
new method devised by the authors (Singh, et al., 1989). Among these, the Type species
took only 10 days to break the human hair followed by strain I (16 days), strain III (17
days), strain IV (18 days), strain VIII (23 days), strain VI (24 days), strain II (25 days),
strain V (26 days) and strain VII (34 days).#Misc-exposition*]

[@All the strains of M. gypseum exhibited keratinolytic activity. However, the
difference in their keratinolytic activity may be due to the varied amounts of keratinase
enzyme produced by them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@IV. Keratin degradation by M. gypseum isolates in Sabouraud's dextrose broth medium
after 20 days.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Studies were carried out to measure the differences in their keratin degradation by
the use of buffalo skin SD broth medium after 20 days of incubation by the "weight-loss"
method (Fer, ers 1969). In this, strain I was found to have the maximum ability to digest
the buffalo skin (37.6%) followed by strain VI (18.2%), strain III (18.0%), strain II
(13.4%), Type species (10.8%), strain IV (9.896), strain VII (2.896) and strain VIIT
(2.896), strain V (2.096). The order of the keratin degradation by these isolates varied in
the case of buffalo skin when compared to that of human hair in the previous experiment.
This may be due to the preferential utilization of keratin source by different fungi. This
variation is quite obvious from the present study even among the strains of the same
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HELOTIUM CITRINOCOLOR#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helotium citrinocolor was introduced by the Crouan brothers for a
discomycete collected on twigs of Rubus in west France pease
with a “Réceptacle de 2 4 4 milim., sessile, couleur citron,” (P. & H.
Crouan, 1867). Later, the species was reported by Saccardo (1889),
Boudier (1907), who transferred it to Calycella, and by Grelet (1947).
All three have cited the specific name erroneously as ‘citrinicolor’
and, since no additional data were presented, it is evident that they
were not familiar with the fungus from their own experience. The
only known recent record of Helotium citrinocolor was reported by
Svrcek (1962, as '"citrinicolor) who collected the fungus in Nizke
Tatry Mountains, Slovakia. in 1960. An investigation of the
specimen at PRM by the senior author, while studying Slovak species
of the genus Hymenoscyphus (Nees) S. F. Gray (Lizon, 1992), has
indicated that Helotium citrinocolor is clearly not a member of
Hymenoscyphus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@472#Misc-exposition*]

[@Authentic material of Helotium citrinocolor P. & H. Crouan at CO
includes 5 specimens. The “type” specimen of Helotium citrinocolor is
a mixture of three collections, of which one apothecium, packed
separately, was marked by Le Gal as lectotype. The collection on
Rubus twig(s) "Sur ..de Ronce' (P. & H. Crouan, 1867) should be
separated after recognizing the host and designated as a lectotype.
Apothecia of the lectotype and other specimens of the Crouans’
collections are shallow cupulate, sessile, bright yellow, the disc is
bright yellow to golden yellow, the receptacle is paler and naked.
The excipulum is not clearly divided to ectal and medullary layers
and is composed of thick-walled cells with gelatinized walls, forming
a refractive tissue of interwoven to parallel hyphae. Ascospores are
ellipsoid to fusoid, 0-1-septate, 7.0-80 x 20-2. µm and 8-11 x
2-2.5-3 µm according to Le Gal (1953), and paraphyses extend
above the asci. A few hyaline phialides, up to 5 µm long, were
observed by us on the outer surface of the receptacle.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Slovak specimen of Helotium citrinocolor appears to be
conspecific, and has golden yellow apothecia when dry, becoming
straw yellow when rehydrated, 1-2 mm diam., sessile to subsessile.
The ectal and medullary excipulum is composed of parallel to
interwoven cells 5-11.5 µm long, with clearly gelatinized walls,
elongated toward the margin. Asci are 56-81.5 x 5.3-7 µm, pore
blue in Melzer's reagent. Ascospores are ellipsoid, ellipso-clavate or
inequilateral, nonseptate, 0-3-gutttulate, (8.4-) 10.4-12.4 (-13.4) x
(2.4-) 2.7-3.4 (-3.7) µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HELOTIUM DISCEDENS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helotium discedens P. Karst. was described from a Brasilian
collection on the bark of an unidentified broad-leaved tree.
Carpenter considered Helotium citrinocolor synonymous with
Bisporella discendens (P. Karst.) S. E. Carpenter judging by his notes
on the type specimen of the former. We have examined a lectotype
(designated by Carpenter, 1975) and another Karsten specimen at H
and a specimen of Bisporella discedens collected in Puerto Rico
(CUP-PR 4164) as identified by him and agree with his conclusion.
We have not studied type specimens of Niptera subiculata Seaver or
of Trichopeziza aurea Rick, and we accept Carpenter's decision#Misc-exposition*]

[@1 All observations based on dry specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Carpenter, 1975) that they are synonymous with Bisporella
discedens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HELOTIUM PEZIZOIDEUM#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have studied the holotype of Helotium pezizoideum M. C.
Cooke & W. Phillips which contains probably only one apothecium.
It has similar characters to Peziza claroflava but we have some
reservations on the excipular structure and thus we report it as a
synonym with a question mark.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PEZIZA CLAROFLAVA#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Crouans (on the type specimen label and on drawings at CO)
annotated their new Helotium citrinocolor as "Helotium claroflavum
Berk. Outlines?” and as "Helotium claroflavum (Grev.) Berk.” Le Gal
(1953) has pointed out that the name Peziza claroflava Grev.
(=Helotium claroflavum (Grev.) Berk.)] could have priority if the
names are synonyms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Greville’s collections at E, labeled Peziza claroflava, consist of three
specimens. The type specimen envelope includes two collections
(syntypes), both from Braid Hermitage [near Edinburgh], one dated
September 1821 and the other November 1821. Nannfeldt (1936)
“saw what may be the specimen referred to by Massee, viz. in
Cooke's handwriting: Helotium claroflavum - ex Grev." at K (which
is a portion of one of the syntypes) and has noted “this specimen is
typical young Calycella citrina (Hedw. ex Fr)" Dennis (1956)
examined probably the same "authentic material at Kew" of Peziza
claroflava and agreed with Nannfeldt's conclusion. Nannfeldt's (and
Dennis) conclusion was followed by Cannon, Hawksworth &
Sherwood-Pike (1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Greville did not designate the type (holotype) specimen in his
collection at E and the collection at K is presumably (as noted on
the label) a part of one of these specimens removed by M. C.
Cooke: thus both the September and November portion of the type
collection at E, as well as the portion of one of these at K are
syntypes.? Since both at E are immature we designate the
specimen at K, which possesses mature characters, as the lectotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE GENUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many species of Bisporella are associated with other fungi (Korf &
Carpenter, 1974). Although there are several perithecia of Nectria
magnusiana Rehm in the specimen of Helotium  claroflavum
collected by Carmichael (E), no connection between these two fungi
has been found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Carpenter (1975) has assigned the anamorph of Bisporella discedens
to Cystodendron Bubak, but Johnston (1988) stated that it should be
placed in the genus Bloxamia Berk. & Br. The junior author
(unpublished data) studied anamorphs in several Bisporella species
and also concluded that Bloxamia is the logical genus for them. We
have observed similar phialides in specimens we studied determined
as Helotium citrinocolor and Bisporella discedens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Korf & Zhuang (1985) expressed doubt if B. discedens can be really
distinguished from the common Bisporella sulphurina (Quél) S. E.
Carpenter. This species seems to be really closely related to B.
claroflava and it may be conspecific. Quélet's collections were partly
destroyed (Gilbert, 1949) and also the type specimen of Helotium
sulphurinum Quél. is missing at PC (R. Cailleux, in litt). Until a
lectotype or neotype is chosen for Quélet's species, no conclusions
can be made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascomycete Systematics: Problems and _ Perspectives
in the Nineties, edited by David L. Hawksworth. Hardcover,

[@This book is a fascinating report of the First
International Workshop on Ascomycete Systematics, held in
Paris on May 11-14, 1993, involving 140 researchers from 24
countries, and supported by the Association Frangaise de
Lichénologie and NATO (as one of their NATO Advanced
Research Workshop series). The first paragraph of the
Foreword states the raison d'etre for such a workshop: "In the
important world of the Fungi, the ascomycete group is not only
the largest in the number of species, but also the one with the
most medical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional applications."
There were two distinct parts to the Workshop, the first two days
being devoted to reviews of criteria used in ascomycete
systematics and general characteristics and problems in
Ascomycetes. The last two days were more technical, basically
discussions arranged around the "Outline of the Ascomycetes"
proposals that are the foundation of the ascomycete
presentations in the volumes of the journal Systema
Ascomycetum. (The 1993 "Outline" prepared after the Workshop
appears on pp 425-429.) What is particularly delightful is that
not merely the prepared texts of the talks and discussion groups
are presented here, along with the figures from the slides that
were projected, but also the lively discussions that followed
have been included, edited from tapes and notes presented to the
organizers by the speakers. While there are obviously some
errors in transcription of those comments, most appear to this
reviewer (who was an audience and rarely panel discussant
during many of the talks) to capture the essence of the
discussions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first chapter, "Ascomycete Systematics in the
Nineties," by D. L. Hawksworth and J. Mouchacca, summarizes
the "key issues" that emerged at the Workshop: "The Systematic
Value of Different Categories of Characters" is broken down into
(i) Ascoma, Conidioma, and Thallus Structure and Ontogeny, (ii)#Misc-exposition*]
[@480#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascus and Ascospore Structure, (iii) Septal Structure, (iv)
Secondary Metabolites, (v) Paleomycology and Biogeography,
(vi) Ecological Strategies, Species Concepts, and Population
Biology, (vii) Cladistics, and (viii) Molecular Biology. "Problems
in Particular Groups" reflects some of the technical matters
discussed on the last two days of the Workshop. "Challenges for
the Future" reflects Hawksworth and Mouchacca's views under
the headings (i) The Holomorph Concept, (ii) Supraordinal
Ranks, (iii) Terminology, (iv) Working Practices and Data
Capture, (v) Meeting the Needs of Users, and (vi) The Mismatch
Between Resources and the Knowledge Gap.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In no way can a brief book review attempt to point out
even the most important conclusions and conjectures that arose
at this Workshop. So many major workers had so much to say on
so many diverse topics that all this reviewer can suggest is that
each serious or even fledgling student of the Ascomycetes (and
their anamorphs) examine the book carefully. Each will find
this volume to be an awesome source of inspiration for its
attention to the unanswered (and perhaps unanswerable)
questions awaiting researchers of the future. It will certainly
lead the novice to discover how little most of us who have been
active in the field of Ascomycete Systematics know about our
subject!#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book deserves to be on the bookshelf of all teaching
institutions where mycology is presented, should be consulted
by all commercial concerns that hope to make a profit from
fungi and fungal products, and perhaps most of all should be
perused by granting agencies and the panels that decide on
what mycological work needs support: the evidence is detailed
here, from compelling arguments to fund expensive and
sophisticated studies on molecular systematics to a tacit
understanding that without massive support for additional field-
based studies we will have lost our opportunity to "use" the
fungi we otherwise will have lost as man continues to destroy
the tropical rainforests and other refuges of biological
diversity. Richard P. Korf, Plant Pathology Herbarium, Cornell

[@Europe. The generic concepts and the range of genera and
families treated here are essentially the same as in the
corresponding two-volume treatment of North American
Polypores, by the same authors. The family level#Misc-exposition*]

[@classification followed is again that of Donk. By the author's
own admission, the taxa treated here are not a monophyletic
group, and certain non-poroid taxa that are presumably closely
related to polypores have been specifically excluded (e.g.
Lentinus and certain corticioid fungi). This may limit the value
of the book for some specialists, but it in no way detracts from
its utility as a floristic treatment and diagnostic tool for
polypores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Part 1 included introductory chapters discussing
taxonomic characters, pathology, decay, mycogeography, and a
key to families and genera, followed by descriptions of species
in the genera Abortiporus to Lindtneria. Part 2 carries on with
descriptions of species in Meripilus to Tyromyces, followed by a
list of authorities and their abbreviations, a treatment of the
etymology of specific and generic names, the references, and a
taxonomic index. The latter two items will be especially
welcomed by those who until now have had to work with Part 1
alone. In general, Part 2 adheres to the same standardized
format that was adopted in Part 1. Genera represented by
multiple species are provided with dichotomous keys to species,
and the larger genera have useful synoptic keys as well (e.g.
Phellinus, Polyporus, Trametes). Each species is described in
terms of a standardized set of character fields:
macromorphology, hyphal system, cystidia and other sterile
hymenial elements, basidia, basidiospores, rot type, mating
system, substrate, and distribution. Cultural characters are not
discussed, but there is ample reference to available literature
for each species. Anatomical illustrations and a European range
map are provided for each species. Many of the species treated
here were also described in North American Polypores, but
in all such cases new illustrations have been prepared for the
present volume. This enables the reader to gain a sense of the
range of morphological variation in certain species. Habit
sketches have been provided for twenty-six species, but were
not present in Part 1. These nicely illustrate certain
macromorphological features, but would be more useful for
identification if all species had been drawn.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are a few minor discrepancies between Parts 1 and
2, but none that seriously limit the utility of the pair. For
example, a glossary was promised in part 1, but is absent from
Part 2. However, chapters 2 and 3 in Part 1 adequately describe
and illustrate morphological characters, rendering a glossary
for this material superfluous. The treatment of Ceriporiopsis is#Misc-exposition*]
[@482#Misc-exposition*]

[@a potential source of confusion. In Part 2, several species of
Skeletocutis are transferred into Ceriporiopsis, which was
covered in Part 1. The transfers necessitated an expanded key to
Ceriporiopsis as well as descriptions and illustrations of the new
combinations in Part 2, under Skeletocutis, where they might
not be expected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite these minor flaws, European  Polypores Part 2
presents a coherent and useful taxonomy for a diverse,
important group of fungi. It would be an error to conclude that
this book is only relevant for students of European polypores.
As noted, many of the species treated here occur outside of
Europe. Furthermore, the present volume should be considered
in the context of the authors' previous contributions to
taxonomy of polypores on a global scale. Throughout these
works, the authors clearly define generic concepts and
taxonomic characters, and adhere to a standardized set of
character fields for descriptions and illustrations. This makes
the character basis of their taxonomy readily apparent and
accessible, and promises to contribute to a unified, stable
classification for polypores worldwide. This is an important
reference for all students of polypores and should serve as a
model for other floristic studies. D. S.H.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Myxomycetes make up a fascinating group of organisms
that are frequently overlooked even by mycologists. This new
handbook promises to introduce many new students and
amateur mycologists to the myxomycetes, as well as entice
professional mycologists to seek out myxomycetes in nature, and
devote more time to myxomycetes in general mycology and
biodiversity-oriented classes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book is arranged in six chapters. The first includes
an introduction to basic biology and life cycles of slime molds.
The second describes and illustrates with clear drawings and
photographs the taxonomic characters used for identification.
The third describes methods for collecting and culturing
myxomycetes, including step-by-step methods for isolation from
bark and other substrates, as well as a guide to construction of a
myxomycete herbarium using cheap, readily available
materials. This chapter will be particularly useful to biology
teachers who wish to incorporate myxomycetes into their#Misc-exposition*]
[@483#Misc-exposition*]

[@courses. The fourth chapter discusses biogeography of
myxomycetes and characteristic myxomycetes of specialized
habitats, such as snow-melt areas. The fifth chapter concerns
myxomycete ecology, including interesting, often suggestive,
discussions on associations between myxomycetes and insects,
fungi, and bryophytes. Chapter six, on classification and
identification, makes up the bulk of the book. Brief passages on
nomenclature and the structure of hierarchical classifications
are followed by keys to the orders of myxomycetes, and selected
species in each order. Next come the descriptions and
illustrations for each of the 56 species found in the key. For
each species, there is an illustration showing macromorphology
of the sporangia or plasmodiocarp as well as anatomical
sketches of spores, capillitia, etc. Nineteen of the species are
also illustrated in the excellent watercolors presented in the
color plates (one of my favorites includes a developmental
series showing ontogeny of Stemonities axifera sporangia).
With only 56 species in the key, this is not meant to be an
exhaustive treatment of all myxomycete species. Nevertheless,
under the "comments" section for each species, closely related
or similar species and their diagnostic characters are discussed.
Thus, in the Preface, this book is justifiably presented as "a field
guide to approximately 175 of the common species of
myxomycetes." The glossary that follows the species
descriptions will be appreciated by students trying to work the
keys. The thorough list of references will provide entry to
specialized literature and encourage further study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is an attractive, beautifully produced book. In fact,
one of my only negative comments is that it may be too pretty to
take into the field. The hardcover format with dustjacket does
not lend itself to being stuffed into a pocket or collecting basket.
A more substantive criticism concerns the section in the
introductory chapter with the heading, "What are
Myxomycetes?" Here the authors recall the conflicting
classifications of myxomycetes either as fungi or as Mycetozoa,
related to animals, and conclude that "whatever their
relationships to other living organisms, study of myxomycetes
has been, and still is, carried out by botanists, particularly
mycologists. ^ Although this statement is true (if vague), it does
not reflect the current understanding that myxomycetes are not
in the same lineage as the chytrids, zygomycetes, ascomycetes,
and basidiomycetes, and therefore are not true fungi. However,
this is a minor criticism of an otherwise excellent book that will
undoubtedly increase awareness and appreciation of
myxomycetes. I recommend it highly. D.S.H.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This mycology illustrates the great diversity of life styles and activities of
fungi, using over 600 figures. Most of the figures are SEM or TEM micrographs
which are nicely reproduced and delightful to see. The text consists of three
chapters: (1) Introduction, (2) Taxonomy and morphology of fungi, and (3)
Ecology of fungi. In the Introduction, major characteristics of fungi, especially
their cell structures are discussed and illustrated in comparison with those of
other organisms. In the second chapter the structure, development, and method
of spore discharge of diverse fungi ranging from the Myxomycetes to the
Basidiomycotina are shown, using original micrographs wherever possible.
Fungi belonging to the hyphomycetes are categorized on the basis of conidium
ontogeny. The third chapter deals with such aspects as (i) saprobic fungi and
their sucession on natural substrates, (ii) fungal interactions with other fungi and
other organisms, and (iii) survival in diverse conditions. Important concepts in
categorizing the fungal OR 0.9. antagonism (antibiosis), parasitism,
commensalism, and mutualism are discussed and illustrated. Various survival
structures are demonstrated in the e fool section with emphasis on the
morphological variations among sclerotia of different genera. Reviews of this
