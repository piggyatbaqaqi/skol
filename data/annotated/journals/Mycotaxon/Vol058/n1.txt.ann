[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material of Gloeocystidiellum Donk sensu lato for this study was collected in
Taiwan during 1988-1994. Apart from the main purpose of surveying components of
this group in Taiwan, efforts were also made to delimit several genera which have been
segregated from Gloeocystidiellum s.|. The main features used to separate these genera
include nuclear behavior, basidial shape, hyphal septation, hyphal system and spore
ornamentation. Special emphasis is also given to discussion of the taxonomic placement
of Gloeocystidiellum s.l. Auriscalpioideae, Hericioideae and Wrightoporioideae are
proposed as new subfamilies in the Auriscalpiaceae. Six genera are recognized in this
study including a proposed new genus, Gloeomyces. Based on the Taiwanese collections,
twenty-two species are described. Six species are newly recorded from Taiwan, viz.
Conferticium heimii, C. ochraceum, C. ravum, Gloeocystidiellum aspellum, G.
porosum and Megalocystidium luridum. Fifteen new species are described, viz. Boidinia
cana, B. granulata, B. luteola, B. macrospora, Gloeocystidiellum aculeatum, G.
compactum, G. formosanum, G. laxum, G. moniliforme, G. purpureum, G. tabacinum,
Gloeomyces ginnsii, G. graminicola, Gloiothele citrinoidea and G. globosa. Collections
of most new species, were made from subtropical or tropical belts of Taiwan. New
combinations are proposed for: Boidinia inconstans, C. heimii, Gloiothele zawitense,
Megalocystidium luteocystidiatum and Stereum wakullum. Descriptions and_ line
drawings are given for each species. Basidiospore SEM photographs are provided for
those with ornamented surfaces. Results of cultural and cytological studies are provided
for many species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Page-header*]
[@Gloeocystidiellum sensu lato#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gloeocystidiellum s.|. is interpreted in the sense of the emended genus
Gloeocystidiellum Donk em. Donk proposed by Donk (1956). The genus
Gloeocystidiellum Donk was originally erected by Donk (1931) for
nomenclatural reasons as a substitute for Gloeocystidium Karst. Héhnel &
Litschauer (1908) and Bourdot & Galzin (1913, 1928) misapplied the
Gloeocystidium concept of Karsten (1889). Gloeocystidium was conceived by
them as different from Corticium Fr. by the presence of glococystidia, and from
Peniophora by the lack of "cystidia" (encrusted cystidia). However, two of
Karsten's species of Gloeocystidium, G. guttuliferum and G. exsudans, lack
gloeocystidia. Thus, the species treated by Karsten in Gloeocystidium were
transferred by these mycologists to other genera, but the name G/oeocystidium
was retained in a different sense. Burt (1926) thus rejected Gloeocystidium and
transferred the apparently misapplied members to Corticium, because he did not
regard the presence of glococystidia as important for recognizing a separate
genus. Donk (1931) proposed a new genus Gloeocystidiellum for the misapplied
Gloeocystidium, but meanwhile stated that it was an artificial genus. Later, Donk
(1956) emended and restricted Gloeocystidiellum to certain species of Bourdot &
Galzin's sections Amyloidea Bourd. & Galz., Ceracea Bourd. & Galz. and
Insidiosa Bourd. & Galz., which are characterized by gloeocystidia and amyloid
basidiospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The emended Gloeocystidiellum was widely accepted for corticioid
basidiomycetes with monomitic hyphal system, euhymenium, gloeocystidia and
amyloid basidiospores (¢.g., Eriksson 1958, Donk 1964, Parmasto 1968, Eriksson
& Ryvarden 1975 and Freeman 1978). Before this study, Gloeocystidiellum s.l.
contained about forty species, mainly from temperate zones. However, even in its
more restricted sense the emended Gloeocystidiellum was (e.g., Donk 1964:271)
regarded as rather heterogeneous. Eriksson & Ryvarden (1975:404) also
remarked that the presence of gloeocystidia and amyloid spores alone does not
form a sufficient base for a natural genus. Therefore Eriksson & Ryvarden (1975)
subdivided Gloeocystidiellum s.\. into seven groups, based on features such as
hyphal septation, cyanophily of hyphae, texture of fruit body, nature of spore wall,
shape of spore and sulfoaldehyde reaction of glococystidia. The seven groups are:
G. porosum group, G. convolvens group, G. ochraceum group, G. furfuraceum
group. G. luridum group, G. lactescens group and G. citrinum group. This
subdivision was subsequently accepted by some other mycologists as a basis for
new genera segregated from Gloeocystidiellum s.l.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genera segregated from Gloeocystidielltam s.1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first genus to be segregated from Gloeocystidiellum s.l. was
Vesiculomyces Hagstrém (Hagstrém 1977), accommodating Thelephora citrina#Misc-exposition*]
[@3#Page-header*]

[@Pers. Vesiculomyces was proposed to represent the G. citrinum group, which is
characterized by SA— gloeocystidia, simple-septate hyphae, almost spherical
basidiospores and long and narrow basidia (according to Hagstróm 1977).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Megalocystidium Jül., based on members of the G. /uridum and G. lactescens
groups, was erected by Jülich (1978). But in the protologue, no explanation was
given for the concept of this genus. Etymologically, it seems that the main
diagnostic feature of Megalocystidium lies in the big cystidia (gloeocystidia).
Nevertheless, gloeocystidia of the species included by Jülich are not distinctly
bigger than those of others among Gloeocystidiellum s.\. Species of the G.
luridum and G. lactescens groups have SA+ gloeocystidia and smooth
basidiospores, but the G. /uridum group consists of clamped species and G.
lactescens species lack clamps. Boidin & Lanquetin (1983) broadened the
concept of Vesiculomyces to accommodate species with SA+ gloeocystidia and
clamped hyphae because they did not consider hyphal septation to be a consistent
feature for delimiting a genus, and also because the gloeocystidia of G. citrinum
are SA+ in culture (Boidin 1958). Consequently, they regarded Megalocystidium
as a synonym of Vesiculomyces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hjortstam (1987a:69) found features of the type species of Gloiothele Bres.,
G. lamellosa (P. Henn.) Bres., agree perfectly with those of Thelephora
lactescens Berk. (Gloeocystidiellum lactescens group), except that the former has
hyphal pegs. He thus treated some species characterized by features of the G.
lactescens group in the genus Gloiothele. Vesiculomyces epitheloides Boid. &
Lanquetin (Boidin & Lanquetin 1983), was regarded by Hjortstam (1987a) the
same as the type species of Gloiothele. Ginns & Freeman (1994) transferred the
type species of Vesiculomyces, T. citrira to Gloiothele. The combination of the
Gloeocystidiellum citrinum group and the G. lactescens group together in the
genus Glojothele is accepted in this study. The only main difference between the
two groups is the SA reaction of the gloeocystidia, which is SA+ in
Gloeocystidiellum lactescens group, and SA- in other one. But as mentioned
above, this reaction of the G. citrinum group is positive in cultures. Moreover, the
known nuclear behaviors of members of these two groups, viz. Gloiothele citrina
(Pers.) Ginns & Freeman (Boidin 1958), G. /actescens (Boidin 1958) and G.
lammellosa (as V. epitheloides, Boidin & Lanquetin 1983) are all subnormal,
strongly supporting the close affinity between the two groups.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study, Megalocystidium is restricted only to the G/oeocystidiellum
luridum group, characterized by clamped hyphae, clavate basidia, as well as
smooth or minutely verrucose basidiospores. Known species of this genus also
have longer basidia and bigger basidiospores, compared with other genera of
Gloeocystidiellum s.l. From cytological studies, M. /eucoxanthum was reported
(Boidin 1958) as having heterocytic nuclear behavior. The plurinucleate state of
monosporous mycelium in M. /uridum (Boidin 1958) suggests the same nuclear
behavior.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Conferticium Hallenb. was segregated from Gloeocystidiellum s.l.
by Hallenberg (1980). This genus is representative of the C. ochraceum group.#Misc-exposition*]
[@4#Page-header*]

[@Conferticium is distinguished from other genera of Gloeocystidiellum s.1. by
combined characteristics such as  simple-septate hyphae, very dense
pseudoparenchymatic context consisting of vertical and cyanophilous hyphae,
and the internal basidial repetition. The holocoenocytic nuclear behavior of this
genus (C. ochraceum, reported by Boidin 1966b) further distinguishes this genus.
In this study, the finding of holocoenocytic nuclear behavior of C. heimii and C.
ravum, confirms that these three species belong into the same genus. All studies
based on fruit bodies revealed that Conferticium is a clampless genus. However,
the presence of single, double and multiple clamped hyphae in cultures (e.g.,
Nakasone 1990) of this genus may reflect the phenomenon of holocoenocytic
nuclear behavior.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boidinia Stalpers & Hjortst. was segregated by Hjortstam & Stalpers (1982)
from Gloeocystidiellum s.\., and the type species, B. furfuracea (Bres.) Stalpers &
Hjortst. represents the G. furfuraceum group. This genus is diagnostically
characterized by the presence of suburniform basidia and ornamented
basidiospores. At first, only a clamped species was treated in Boidinia (Hjortstam
& Stalpers 1982). Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1988) broadened the generic concept
and included in Boidinia some clampless species. The emended Boidinia is
temporarily accepted in this study. Owing to the addition of more species in this
genus, the original sense of the G. furfuraceum group based on only one species
(Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975:404), such as loose texture, clamped hyphae and
globose spores, somewhat deviates from the concept of Boidinia we know now.
Cytologically, B. furfuracea seems to have normal nuclear behavior (Boidin &
Lanquetin 1984). In this study, B. granulata is found to have bipolar sexuality
with normal nuclear behavior. while B. macrospora is homothallic with
holodikaryotic nuclear behavior. In corticioid basidiomycetes, homothallic
species and heterothallic species can be accommodated in the same genus (cf.
Boidin 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Amylosporomyces Rattan was erected based on a cystidium-
lacking species (Rattan 1977). Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1988) added Corticium
subasperisporum Litsch. as second species of Amylosporomyces and remarked
that two species share dense tissue of basidiome and similar shape of basidia and
basidiospores, although C. subasperisporum have gloeocystidia. Ginns &
Freeman (1994) accepted the treatment of Hjortstam & Ryvarden. Corticium
subasperisporum was placed by Jiilich (1982) in Boidinia, viz. B. subasperispora
(Litsch.) Jiil., because having main features of this genus. Further evidence is
needed to group species with "reniform" basidiospores together in
Amylosporomyces, as taxonomically distinguished from those of Boidinia.
Presently I still regard Amylosporomyces as a cystidium-lacking Boidinia-like
genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Jülich (1982) established Gloeocystidiopsis Jül. based on Gloeocystidiellum
flammeum Boid. and G. heimii, and designated the former as type species. In the
protologue, the only feature mentioned for this genus was the coenocytic hyphae,
which lack clamps or only sometimes have a few verticillate clamps. However,#Misc-exposition*]
[@5#Page-header*]

[@this characteristic is found in the genus Conferticium. Holocoenocytic nuclear
behavior of these two species have been reported by Boidin (1966b). After
studying specimens of G. flammeum (holotype, LY 5284) and G. heimii (LY
6116), features of the latter fit well the concept of Conferticium described above.
The holotype of G. flammeum studied by me, hyphae are acyanophilous, further
basidia are fairly uniformly thin-walled and without indication of basidial
repetition. The cyanophilic hyphae may not always be a consistent feature in a
genus. For instance, the basidiome hyphae of Hyphodontia John Erikss. and
Peniophora Cooke are cyanophilous in some species, acyanophilous in others.
However, whether presence of repetitive basidia in G. flammeum can be
understood by ultrastructural studies as have been undertaken by Hallenberg
(1981) for Conferticium species, to prove should Gloeocystidiopsis be a synonym
of Conferticium, or an independent genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The segregation of several genera from Gloeocystidiellum s.l. by the abovc-
mentioned authors, chiefly according to the several groups proposed by Eriksson
& Ryvarden (1975), is basically accepted with some amendments in this study.
Gloeocystidiellum s.s. presently consists of the GC. porosum and C. convolvens
groups. i.c. also accommodating clampless members. Further study is needed to
determine whether they should be kept together. Homogeneous genera composed
of clamped and clampless members, are not uncommon in corticioid
basidiomycetes. With caution, separation of these genera can be achieved based
on fruit body studies alone. However, cultural and cytological studies may aid for
their separation. Both the broad and narrow concepts of G/oeocystidiellum, are
currently being used for describing species. Clear delimitations of these genera,
have not been examined or accepted by many mycologists. Diagnostic features of

new record, but they reported that the Taiwanese collection had distinctly larger
basidiospores than those in collections from temperate zones of other countrics.
The specimen Wu & Chen studied is treated in this paper as a new species: G.
citrinoidea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lin & Chen (1990) reported Gloeocystidiellum lactescens (= Gloiothele
lactescens) as a new record, and Gloeocystidiellum luridum (= Megalocystidium
luridum) var. microsporum Z.C. Chen & S.H. Lin as a new variety in their studies
of corticioid basidiomycetes of Taiwan. I have studied specimen no. NTU-2567
which they identified as "G. lactescens". The basidiospore dimensions, accurately
measured by them as 6.2-7 x 5-6 µm, are broader than those of G. /actescens. In
this and other features NTU-2567 conforms to Gloeocystidiellum orientale Parm.
The Taiwanese collection was collected at 2600 m altitude, sharing a temperate
habitat similar to that of the type specimen from Europe. Features such as simple-
septate hyphae, smooth-walled and globose-subglobose basidiospores correspond
with the concept of Gloiothele. Nevertheless, Gloeocystidiellum orientale was
questioned to be a young form of G. lactescens by Eriksson & Ryvarden (1975:
424).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unfortunately | could not find from TAI type material of G. luridum var.
microsporum. According to the protologue, G. /uridum var. microsporum may be
a synonym of G. /uteocystidium (Talbot) Boid. var. brevisporum Rattan.
Basidiospores of the latter were reported to be 4.5-6.5 (-8.5) x 4-4.5 µm (Rattan
1977), but those of the same specimen were measured by Freeman (1978) as 5.5-
6 x 3-3.5 µm, similar to those described for G. luridum var. microsporum (5-6
X 3-3.5 µm, from the protologue). The thin fruit body and thin hymenial layer,
described for G. /uridum var. microsporum, may reflect the young growth stage
of the type collection. Basidiospores of Gr. /uteocystidium var. brevisporum are
much smaller than those of the type variety, and with no overlap between them
(measurements from type specimens of two varictics by Freeman 1978).
Therefore var. brevisporum should be promoted to species level, but then its
generic placement would become a problem. It could be regarded as a member of
Megalocystidium, on account of its clamped hyphae and smooth-walled
basidiospores, but known species of this genus have fairly long basidia and larger
basidiospores. Judging from the length of basidia and size of basidiospores,
another possibility is the genus Gloeocystidiellum s.s., if smooth-spored species
can be accommodated. Cytological studies should be undertaken before the
decision of its generic placement is made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taxonomic placement of Glococystidiellum s.1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The problem of taxonomic placement of Gloeocystidiellum s.l. is far from
settled, like many other members of the corticioid basidiomycetes. In Donk's
(1964) treatment of the families of the Aphyllophorales, he regarded
Gloeocystidiellum as partly in the Corticiaceae (the family also regarded by him
as a highly artificial assemblage), but he also mentioned the connection (as a
resupinate form) with the Hericiaceae. Parmasto (1968) established the subfamily
Gloeocystidielloideae in the Corticiaceae to accommodate Gloeocystidiellum and
Laxitextum. Gloeocystidiellum s.l. has long been treated by most mycologists as a
member of the Corticiaceae s.l. (e.g., Eriksson 1958, Donk 1964, Gilbertson 1974,
Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975, Parmasto 1986, Tellería 1990). A few mycologists
regard this group as a member of the Hericiaceae (e.g., Rattan 1977). Jülich
(1981) erected the new family Gloeocystidiellaceae Jiil., and placed this family
and some others characterized by gloeocystidia (or gloeoplerous hyphae) and
amyloid basidiospores under his new order Hericiales Jül. Ginns & Freeman
(1994) adopted the Gloeocystidiellaceae for their studies of the eight genera of
North America, but they remarked that the family is heterogeneous and
apparently polyphyletic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are several groups of lignicolous basidiomycetes with glococystidia

[@Characters currently used by mycologists for the taxonomy of these groups,
are mostly morphological and these are not sufficient for final decisions in
systematics. The proposed family and subfamily system is constructed following
comprehensive consideration. This scheme can be used for further testing,
according to new results obtained from molecular and ultrastructural studies in
future. In arranging the subfamilies of the Auriscalpiaceae, additional
explanations are provided as follows.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After detailed studies of macro- and microscopic characters, Maas
Geesteranus (1963) concluded that the agaric genus Lentinellus is close to
Auriscalpium, and he proposed the family Auriscalpiaceae to accommodate these
two genera and also Gloiodon. This arrangement has been accepted, e.g., by
Donk (1964) and Singer (1986). Results from molecular sequence data (Hibbett
1994) indicated that Auriscalpium and Lentinellus are monophyletic. Donk (1964)
established the Hericiaceae in contrast to the Auriscalpiaceae by accommodating
species with a monomitic hyphal system and SA-— gloeocystidia. The dimitic
nature of the hyphal system of Gloioden was questioned, for example by Maas
Geesteranus (1963). Thus the subfamily Auriscalpioideae is here confined to
stipitate taxa: Auriscalpium and Lentinellus, while Gloiodon is placed in the
Hericioideae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Gloeodontia was proposed by Boidin (1966a) and he
placed this genus in the family Auriscalpiaceae because type species,G. discolor
(Berk. & Curt.) Boid., has a dimitic hyphal system and SA+ gloeocystidia. G.
columbiensis Burt ex Burdsall & Lombard was reported by Burdsall & Lombard
(1976) to be monomitic. However, after studying specimens of these two species,
I regard their hyphal systems as quite similar. For me, the encrusted cystidia of C.
columbiensis are similar to the normal skeletal cystidia, but with restricted length.
Nevertheless, skeletals can be developed in many evolutionary lines. Gloeodontia
is herein placed in Gloeocystidielloideae instead of Auriscalpioideae, because the
latter is considered to be limited to stipitate and strictly dimitic species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Clavicoronaceae Corner was erected based on Clavicorona s.l. (Corner
1970). This family was accepted, for example by Jiilich (1981). However, Donk
(1971) discussed the resemblance between Clavicorona and Hericium. ^s a result,
Clavicorona (also Artomyces) is presently placed in the Hericioideae. In addition,
Donk (1971) regarded Mucronella as a strongly reduced form of Hericium, and
noted that the finding of Dentipratulum (Domafüski 1965) links Hericium and
Mucronella. Fruit bodies in the Hericioideae are fairly variable, but with hydnoid
tendencies for the hymenial surfaces. Members of this subfamily usually have
SA- glococystidia. Macroscopically, it was interesting to find (Miller & Stewart
1971) that in cultures of Lentinellus cochleatus clavarioid sporophores developed
at low temperatures. Microscopically, the hyphal system and gloeocystidium#Misc-exposition*]
[@10#Page-header*]

[@sulfo-reaction are not sufficient characters for differentiating between families.
Ultrastructural studies performed by Capellano & Keller (1978), indicated that
there are no differences in basidiospore architectures between members of the
"Auriscalpiaceae" and the "Hericiaceae". Based on these reasons, the
Auriscalpiaceae and Hericiaceae are thus regarded as the same family.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Corticiaceae s.l. was earlier encompassed within the Thelephoraceae s.l.
After segregation of many families from the Thelephoraceae s.l. in recent decades,
the Corticiaceae has become a residual group, due to lacks of distinctive features.
Nowadays the Corticiaceae is still a heterogeneous entity with numerous genera
and species. Parmasto (1994) cladistically studied genera of the Corticiaceae s.I.,
and concluded that it is a paraphyletic group. He also suggested that the
classification of this group is only reasonable when non-corticioid genera are also
included. A/eurodiscus s.l. (in the Aleurodiscoideae here) has often been treated
in the Corticiaccae, but it also has gloeocystidia and amyloid spores in common
with Gloeocystidiellum s.l. Moreover, members of Acanthophysium (or the
synonym: Acanthophysellum Parm., in Aleurodiscoideae here) have been
regarded as intermediate between Aleurodiscus and Gloeocystidiellum s.l. (e.g..
Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975). The Aleurodiscoideae should be isolated from the
Corticiaceae and is moved, together with some other groups which also have
gloeocystidia and amyloid basidiospores, to the Auriscalpiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Stereoideae as used here has the same concept as the well known
Stereaceae but reduced in rank. Concept of the "Stereaceae" is not consistent
among mycologists, and many genera have been customarily accepted in this
group because superficially they have stereoid fruit bodies and skeletal hyphae
(e.g., Lopharia Kalchbr. & McOwan). Stereum is regarded by many mycologists
(e.g., Boidin et al. 1979, Eriksson et al. 1984) as dimitic because of its
"pseudocystidia" with long and thick-walled skeletal-like basal parts. To me, the
"pseudocystidia" represent a modified form of gloeocystidia. The finding of a
"monomitic" species bearing fairly typical glococystidia (S. wakullum) as
reported in appendix of this paper, may explain this. Recognition of hyphal
system in Stereum is thus rather subjective. I prefer to consider this genus as
hemidimitic, because the skeletal-like structures are usually dominant in the
context of Stereum. The family name Stereaceae has long been used, but in my
opinion mainly due to tradition. I would like to treat it under the Auriscalpiaceae,
because all features are within the concept of the latter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Jülich (1981) erected the Wrightoporiaceae under the Hericiales. Though
Wrightoporia exhibits dextrinoid skeletal hyphae, like those in the
Lachnocladiaceae, it lacks the utriform basidia of the latter. Dextrinoid skeletal
hyphae can be found in many polypore genera, indicating that this feature
developed separately for many groups. The Lachnocladiaceae is herein
considered to be separate from the Auriscalpiaceae because it is uniformly
characterized by branched and dextrinoid skeletal hyphae (or asterosetae) and
utriform basidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The presence of gloeocystidia (or gloeoplerous hyphae) and amyloid#Misc-exposition*]

[@basidiospores are important features in recognizing the Auriscalpiaceae. However,
loss of either gloeocystidia (or gloeoplerous hyphae) or amyloid basidiospores in
some members can be found (e.g., Amylosporomyces, Clavicorona S.s.,
Mucronella). The acceptance of them in the Auriscalpiaceae is based on other
combined features. However, sufficient evidence is needed in searching
additional amyloid-spored or gloeocystidium-exhibiting members (e.g.,
Amylostereum Boid., Echinodontium Ell. & Ev., Gloeohypochnicium (Parm.)
Hjortst., Laurilia Pouz.) for the Auriscalpiaceae.#Description*]

[@At a higher rank, where do the Auriscalpiaceae and Lachnocladiaceae belong?
An answer of Aphyllophorales seems to be far from satisfactory. Donk (1971)
probably was the first to discuss the possibility of connecting the Russulales to
some groups in the Aphyllophorales possessing glocoplerous hyphae and amyloid
spores. Since then, very few mycologists (e.g., Oberwinkler 1977, Redhead &
Norvell 1993) have mentioned this possibility, mostly because the Russulales has
long been treated in the agaric group. Is it possible that long ago a branch of the
Russulales evolved as lignicolous organisms and that the Auriscalpiaceae and
Lachnocladiaceae are two groups on this branch? New evidence based on
molecular and ultrastructural studies may aid further consideration of this
possibility and also may help with arrangement of subdivisions of the
Auriscalpiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials for this study were collected in Taiwan from various localities
during 1988-1994. For interpretation of collection data such as altitudinal zones,
vegetation, and names of administrative arcas, refer to Wu (1990). The general
methods for dealing with specimens and examination of specimens, and general
terms used for describing various characters, have also been explained by Wu
(1990). Some amendments and additional methods and terms are detailed below.
All studied specimens, as well as fungal cultures, are deposited at the herbarium
of National Museum of Natural Science of ROC (abbreviated as N.M.N.S.).
Some duplicate specimens including isotypes will be distributed to other herbaria.
The abbreviations of herbaria follow Holmgren et al. (1990). Color names used
for describing fruit bodies are from Kornerup & Wanscher (1978).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Observations and measurements of basidiospores#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Gloeocystidiellum s.\., basidiospore ornamentation is retained when
material is mounted in Melzer's reagent (IKI) but the ornamentation disappears in
KOH. In this study definitions for describing ornamentation of spore surfaces
follow Larsson (1994). Accordingly, "aculeate" is defined as having blunt
processes of length/width > 1, and l/w x 1 for "verrucose". To ensure accurate use
of the terms, SEM observations were performed. Dried specimens attached to#Misc-exposition*]
[@12#Page-header*]

[@stubs were coated with gold, and were observed under SEM (HITACHI Model S-
570) at 20 kV. Measurements of basidiospore lengths and widths are based on the
side view -- adaxial and abaxial sides. Apiculi and ornamentation are excluded in
spore measurements. Only spore-prints (abbreviated as SPR) were used for the
purpose of statistical analyses, because spores from SPR can be regarded as
mature. Spores adhering to the hymenial surface may be immature, and choice of
spores for measurement is fairly subjective. In this study, I have decided to use 5
% KOH as the standard mounting medium for all measurements. This medium is
widely accepted for measurement of corticioid and other basidiomycetes, to
ensure that spores have rehydrated. Some mycologists use IKI as the mounting
medium for observation and measurement of Gloeocystidiellum s.1. basidiospores
because it reveals the ornamentation of the spore surface. Some reported spore
measurements may be larger than my measurements from the same material, if
spore ornamentation was included in the former. But in studying this group most
authors did not mention which kind of mounting medium they used for
measuring basidiospores, and whether they have included ornamentation in
measurements. Therefore confusion may arise in comparisons. However, IKI is
mainly used for detecting amyloidity and dextrinoidity, rather than for spore
measurements. The problem becomes more serious if measurements are made
from diversified groups or fungal flora; how is one to know whether spore
measurements are made in IKI or in KOH without indication. One exception is
the study of Ginns & Freeman (1994), where ornamentation is not included in the
sizes of the basidiospores (evidently in KOH). Therefore the measurements by
Ginns & Freeman are comparable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultural and cytological studies#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures of the studied group were obtained in two ways. First, from
isolation of mycelium in the wood beneath the fruit body. Because corticioid
basidiomycetes have fairly thin fruit bodies it is very difficult to obtain cultures
from fruit body internal tissue. The mycelium in the wood is regarded as the same
as that from fruit body, and designated as fruit body mycelium (abbreviated as
FB-mycelium). Secondly, by sequential dilutions of spores from spore-prints,
poured on MEA plates. Several days later, monosporous mycelia and
polysporous mycelia are isolated following germination of spores. In this study,
monosporous mycelium is abbreviated as MS-myceliüm and polysporous
mycelium as PS-mycelium. In many cases cultural studies were performed based
on secondary mycelium (as SC-mycelium) derived from two compatible MS-
mycclium. Though FB-mycelium is often originated from SC-mycelium, it is
better to have separate terms in distinguishing them.#Misc-exposition*]

mycelium, SC-mycelium and PS-mycelium may be used for cultural descriptions
and species codes. In MEA cultures macroscopic features were described each
week until the mycelia covered the plate. Both macroscopic and microscopic
features were described after 6 weeks of growth. Gallic acid agar (GAA) and
tannic acid agar (TAA) were used to test for laccase, and tyrosine agar (TYA)
was used to detect tyrosinase. The methods for preparing these agars and the
expression of the reactions are described by Nakasone (1990). Different sources
of gallic and tannic acid will give consistent oxidase reactions but variable
growth rates (Nakasone 1990). In this study these acids were analytical grade
from "Fluka". The drop tests recommended by Marr (1979) for laccase and
tyrosinase were also used as a comparison.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MS-mycelia were used for determination of sexuality of single-clamped
species. Eight to 10 MS-mycelia were crossed in pairs in all combinations, the
inocula separated by a distance of 1-2 cm. Four weeks after contact, the presence
of normal clamped hyphae from the zone of confrontation indicates compatibility.
Compatibility between two groups of  MS-mycelia indicates bipolar
heterothallism of the specimen. In this case, crossings among the same mating
type should be incompatible. The crossing response for a tetrapolar heterothallic
organism is more complicated. For common AB (A=B=) and common A (A-Bz)
crossings, no clamped hyphae can be found in the zone of confrontation. Normal
clamped hyphae are present for the non-common AB (A#B#) case. False-
clamped hyphae can be found from the zone of confrontation of common B (Az
B=) crossings. The presence of clamped hyphae in all MS-mycelia indicates
homothallism.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For distinguishing "biological species" between closely related species,
compatibility tests were performed by crossing a dikaryotic mycelium with a
haploid mycelium of another specimen, the latter surrounding the dikaryon on the
plate. After four weeks of contact, dikaryotization of the haploid mycelium (as
evidenced by the formation of clamped hyphae) indicates intercompatibility. The
haploid mycelia used for compatibility tests must show fertile capability, usually
sourced from the identified "polarities" in sexuality studies. Nuclear staining with
Giemsa followed the method of Boidin (1958). Fluorescent stains for nuclei were
additionally used. DAPI (4'-6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was found to be
effective in this study at a concentration of 0.25 g/ml. Terminology for nuclear
behavior is based on Boidin & Lanquetin (1984).#Misc-exposition*]

separate them. Conferticium ravum has larger gloeocystidia which often have a
schizopapillate apical constriction. Basidiospores are slightly longer in C. ravum.

[@Remarks: The separation of Conferticium ochraceum from C. insidiosum (Bourd. &
Galz.) Hallenb. is not vet resolved. C. insidiosum was reported to grow on deciduous
trees (Freeman 1978, Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1988), while C. ochraceum occurs on
conifers (Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975, Freeman 1978) but can also be found on
deciduous trees (Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1988). These two species have judged to be
microscopically inseparable (Freeman 1978, Hjortstam & Ryvarden 1988). According
to Bourdot & Galzin (1928), C. ochraceum has bigger basidiospores than C. insidiosum
(5-6 x 3-3.5 µm for the former, and 3-5 x 2-3 µm for the latter). Nevertheless, Freeman
(1978) measured basidiospores of a C. insidiosum specimen (collected and determined
by Bourdot, no. 300063 at PC) as 4-5 x 2.5-3 µm, he also designated neotype (collected
by Fries, at S) for C. ochraceum and measured its basidiospores as 4-4.5 x 2-2.5 µm;
both are similar. However, Hjortstam (1987a) designated another specimen (Sweden.
Upperland, Uppsala, Värdsätra, 13 Oct. 1947, leg. Berit & John Eriksson 2317, Fungi
exc. suec. no. 1851, as Gloeocystidium friesii, deposited at UPS) as neotype of C.
ochraceum. The designation of Hjortstam was accepted by Ginns & Freeman (1994).
Ginns & Freeman (1994) measured basidiospores of North America C. ochraceum
collections as 3.5-5.5 x 2-3 µm. Hjortstam & Ryvarden (1988) designated a lectotype
for C. insidiosum (leg. Galzin 8788, deposited at PC). Basidiospores of Iranian C.
insidiosum specimens are 4-5 x 2-2.5 µm (Hallenberg 1980). Basidiospores of specimen
from temperate Taiwan are larger, 4.2-5.5 »« 2.8-3.3 µm. The measurements based on
North European C. ochraceum specimens (4.5-6 x 3-3.5 µm, from Eriksson & Ryvarden
1975) are close to those from Taiwan. The name C. ochraceum is used for the Taiwan
sample pending better understanding of its relationship with C. insidiosum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: Gloeocystidiellum laxum belongs to the G. convolvens group which is
characterized by simple-septate hyphae and encrusted cystidia. This new species is very
closely related to G. convolvens, although several characteristics combine to separate
them. Macroscopically, the hymenial surface of G. convolvens is tuberculate with dense
warts, while that of G. /axum is strictly smooth. Microscopically, the subiculum of G.
/axum is distinctly looser in texture, and with wider subicular hyphae which are more
thick-walled. Gloeocystidiellum laxum also resembles G. fimbriatum Burds., Nakas. &
Freeman but the latter lacks lamprocystidia. In the protologue (Burdsall et al. 1981),
basidiospores of G. fimbriatum were reported to be 5.5-6 (-6.5) x 3.5-4 µm; while those
which I measured from the holotype (Burdsall 4620, CFMR) were 4-4.8 x 3-3.5 µm,

luteocystidiatum Talbot has been treated in Gloeocystidiellum (Boidin 1966). This

basidiospores, and fairly large basidia and basidiospores. A new combination is made

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiome morphology, hyphal system, basidium morphology and spore
ornamentation are considered to be features of primary importance in systematics
of the G/oeocystidiellum s.l., according to the taxonomy developed for corticioid
basidiomycetes in recent decades, as well as the studies in this paper. Features
such as IKI reaction of basidiome elements, SA reaction of glococystidia and
hyphal septation, can be generally regarded as of secondary importance. Nuclear
behavior in the corticioid basidiomycetes studied mainly by Prof. Boidin for
several decades, is demonstrated in this study to be important for delimitating
genera in Gloeocystidiellum s.\. Nuclear behavior, however, does not appear to be
a definitive character above the genus level. Molecular and ultrastructural studies
are expected to provide additional information for systematics of this group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Four of the six species newly recorded from Taiwan are pantemperate in
their world distribution. The other two species, Conferticium heimii and
Gloeocystidiellum aspellum, are so far known only from Africa and Taiwan. Such
a disjunct distribution accords with the high dispersal capability of corticioid
basidiomycetes, as considered by Wu (1990). Thirteen of the fifteen new species
were collected from the subtropical and tropical belts of Taiwan. Two new#Misc-exposition*]
[@60#Page-header*]

[@species of the new genus Gloeomyces, however, were collected from warm-
temperate - temperate belts of Taiwan. The description of numerous new species
in Taiwan is mainly due to poor investigation of this group in other subtropical-
tropical regions of the world. Many of the new taxa reported here, are expected to
occur in other countries with similar climates. About one third of studied species
were new to science in Wu's (1990) studies of three subfamilies of the
Corticiaceae in Taiwan. In this study, two thirds of Taiwanese species of
Gloeocystidiellum s.l. are new taxa, due to poor investigation of this group
previously of the world and the more complete survey in this study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sulfoaldehyde reaction of gloeocystidia, is best tested on fresh material.
It is quite often observed that this reaction becomes negative after storage of a
collection for a period of time, probably explaining why negative reactions have
been reported for many Gloeocystidiellum species (e.g., Burdsall et al. 1981).
Larsen & Burdsall (1976) indicated that results of the test are sometimes
inconsistent, even for the same specimen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study, specimens were occasionally found to be eaten by invertebrates
in the field or in storage. This probably is due to the presence of fragrant
gloeocystidia in basidiomes. Therefore, it is important to put specimens in self-
sealing plastic bags to avoid invasion by pests.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tyrosine agar, prepared in this study for testing the presence of tyrosinase,
seems to be more sensitive than the use of p-Cresol and L-tyrosine which were
recommended by Marr (1979). However, further studies are necessary to prove
this.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The use of DAPI as a fluorescent stain in the observation of nuclei in
basidiospores and mycelia was practiced in this study as an effective and rapid
method. However, this method is more difficult than the Giemsa staining to
determine nucleus numbers for cells of clampless hyphae, because the positions
of primary septa are quite often difficult to observe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks: Recognition of this species in Stereum is based on a combination of key
features: the presence of acanthophyses, clampless hyphae and smooth basidiospores
which are amyloid. Acanthophyses are comparatively sparse in the holotype, and more
common in the paratype (FP 101812), but this feature was not mentioned in the
protologue and in the study of Ginns & Freeman (1994). Fruit body of this species is
strictly resupinate, without the recurved margins of many Stereum species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Microscopically, gloeocystidia of this species lack the elongate skeletal-like basal parts
which are normally dominant in the context of Stereum species. Basal parts of
gloeocystidia of this species are stalked or fairly narrow for a certain length, and are
slightly brownish and thick-walled as in many other Stereum species. Placement of this
species in Stereum can be confirmed from cultural studies. Nakasone (1990:123)
mentioned the resemblance of this species to Stereum, because of the development of
multiple clamps and fiber hyphae in cultures. In conclusion, S. wakullum possesses the
diagnostic features of Stereum.#Misc-exposition*]

both species she had examined, they were identical.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@When Hansford (1954) erected the species Cystopus
centaurii he distinguished it from C. swertiae on its larger
conidia and oospores. Biga (1955) maintained the species
separation based on those characters and reported differences
in ornamentation of the oospores and, in addition, C. centaurii
was transferred to Albugo. Albugo swertiae was described by
Biga (1955) as having oospores with ornamentation that was
reticulate-papillate, 45-50 µm diam and conidia 11-16 µm in
diam. Albugo centaurii was described as having oospores that
were reticulate-sulcate 50-60 µm in diameter and conidia 18-26
µm in diam.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examination of the type of A. centaurii and many
Australian collections has shown that the conidia are of
average 18 µm diam. Only one available collection of A.
swertiae (isotype material) was examined and it had conidia
averaging 16 µm. There was also a difference in the equatorial#Misc-exposition*]
[@72#Page-header*]

[@thickening in both species, that of A. centaurii being slightly
thicker.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Oogonial size and ornamentation has also revealed
several differences in both species. In A. centaurii the mature
oosporesare very dark brown while those of A.swertiae appear
to remain golden brown. In A. centaurii the ornamentation in
immature oospores is reticulate but at maturity the areolae
become very irregular and elongated (Figure 1a). In A. swertiae
the ornamentation remains reticulate (Figure 1b). The
descriptions of A. swertiae (Saccardo, 1912; and the isotype
packet label ) state that the oospore is reticulate-papillate but
examination of the type did not confirm the presence of
papillae (G. Waterhouse’s notes accompanying the specimen
also agree with this finding). The term sulcate used by
Hansford (1954) in describing the oosporeof A. centaurii would
appear to be inappropriate here given the definition of sulcate
which strictly means “furrows descending into the wall". Such
furrows are not present. In size, the oospores of A-centaurii
average 52 µm compared with A.swertiae which average 41 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These morphological differences are also supported by
apparent host and geographical differences. Albugo swertiae
was described from the Amur region of Russia but does not
appear to have been collected since its original description.
The recent European literature ( Jdrstad, 1964; Sávulescu and
Rayss, 1930) and Asian and North American regional checklists
(Tai, 1979; Ginns, 1986; Farr et al, 1989) have failed to reveal
any records of a species of Albugo on any member of the
Gentianaceae in the Northern Hemisphere other than the
original description of A. swertiae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Centaurium J. Hill is widely distributed
throughoutthe Northern Hemisphere but no species of Albugo
is recorded on it, in contrast to the Southern Hemisphere
where A. centaurii is found apparently commonly on the
introduced species of Centaurium in both Australia and New
Zealand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@73#Page-header*]

[@The genus Swertia L. is also widely distibuted
throughout the Northern Hemisphere through India, China,
Japan and America (Chittenden, 1956) but no species of
Albugo has been reported on any species of Swertia. Orphium
frutescens is a native of South Africa but no species of Albugo
is recorded onit in South Africa (Wakefield, 1927; Dyer, 1952).
In Australia, only the introduced species of Centaurium and
Eustoma have to this time been recorded as hosts of A
centaurii. The original description of A.centaurii gave the type
host as C. spicatum (the only native species of Centaurium in
Australia). Re-examination of the type host has revealed that
the original identification was in error and has been re-
identified as C. erythraea Rafn. (L. Johnson, Herb NSW pers.
comm.), an introduced species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The available evidence suggests that A. centaurii is
probably native on the Southern Hemisphere Gentianaceae. It
is not conspecific with A. swertiae which is known at present
from one collection only and does not occur in the Northern
Hemisphere on the widely distributed genus Centaurium which
is its widely recorded host in the Southern Hemisphere. With
only one specimen of A. swertiae in existence, it appears to be
premature to synonymise both species until further collections
of A. swertiae become available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Krog (1982), Krog & Swinscow (1977) and Swinscow & Krog
(1988) included Punctelia stictica (Del. ex Duby) Krog as a
valid species in this genus but no data regarding the type
of conidia were reported. In Krog's synopsis of the genus
(Krog, 1982) only three species were recorded as having
filiform conidia: P. hypoleucites (Nyl.) Krog, P. wmicro-
sticta (Müll. Arg.) Krog and FP. negata (Nyl.) Krog. Similar-
ly Stenroos' description of P. stictica (Stenroos, 1991)
does not describe the conidia present. Nevertheless my
examination of pycnidiate collections of this species
(Adler, unpublished data) established that it did indeed
have filiform conidia as described previously by Nylander
(1896).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since 1982, further species of Punctelia with filiform
conidia were described: namely P. colombiana (Sérusiaux,
1984) which has also recently been recorded from Argentina
(Adler, 1989), P. subalbicans (Stirt.) D. Gall. & Elix
(Galloway & Elix, 1984), P. nebulata Elix & J. Johnst., P.
novozelandica Elix & J. Johnst. (Elix & Johnston, 1988) and
P. jujensis (Adler, 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The objective of the present work was to compare the
closely allied species P. colombiana and P. stictica (both
of which have filiform conidia) and discuss their differ-
ences.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The vegetative propagules, although showing a wide
range of forms (Fig. 5), must be interpreted as
phyllidia:"... leaf or scale like and dorsiventral struct-
ures..." (Hawksworth, 1984) (Fig. 1). Typical phyllidia
(Fig. 1 a) predominate in the Colombian specimens whereas
the Argentine ones show a predominance of "isidioid" (Fig.
ic, 2b, 4a) and "coralloid" (Fig. 3d) phyllidia. The
interrelationship between diverse forms of these propagules
has been elucidated through a reconstruction of their onto-
geny (Fig. 5): the development of 59» 6, 5 P- 8 and 311
produces forms of flattened leaf-like phyllidia in Colombian
specimens; the development of 39-16 produces less flattened
isidioid phyllidia in Argentine specimens. In saxicolous
collections it is possible to find lobules (Fig. 5 -~ 12) or-
iginating secondarily from the pseudocyphellae through a
phy llidial modification. Punctiform  pseudocyphellae are
frequently formed dorsally (e.g. Fig. 5 - 16) or marginally
(Fig. 5 — 15) in the phyllidia. Large marginal pseudocyphe-
llae can also be found (Fig. 5 - 8), some of which occasion-
ally develop small secondary phyllidia (Fig. 5 - 11). The
phyllidia of P. colombiana are always dorsally corticate
with a paraplectenchymatic tissue (Fig. 1 and 3). The ventr-
al cortex is not always well developed which results in
partial (Fig. 14 - 2, b, c - 2, d) or complete (Fig. 2b) ex-
posure of the medulla.#Misc-exposition*]

secondarily from the pseudocyphellae (Fig. 5). Occasionally
large soredia are found mixed with "isidioid" structures
(Fig. 6 b), which are commonly dorsiventral (Fig.7- 8, 9,

small phyllidia develop into lobules (Fig. 7 - 13), as seen
in saxicolous collections of P. colombiana.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The variation of morphological features with environmental
factors#Misc-exposition*]

[@The brown pigmentation of the upper surface was a
feature of almost all of the collections examined, except
for the corticolous specimens of P. colombiana. The propor-
tion of the thallus tinged with brown was very variable -
from almost the complete upper surface to merely the lobe
margins. This appeared to depend on exposure to the sun,
with exposed specimens from the paramo commonly being
completely brown whereas those growing at protected sites
were only slightly pigmented. This brown pigmentation is
known in other taxa such as Parmelia saxatilis Ach. and is
considered a possible response to strong illumination and a
protection against irradiation (Kappen, 1973).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In both species the pseudocyphellae on the upper
surface vary in size, shape and density and appear to be
dependant upon microclimatic conditions during the thallus#Misc-exposition*]

[@development. This would seem to provide a good reason to
exclude pseudocyphellae characteristics as diagnostic
features at the species level. A good example of this
Variation is shown in the saxicolous specimen of P. stictica
grown in an exposed situation near the absolute desert (Tafi
del Valle, Tucuman). Here all pseudochyphellae are markedly
elevated above the thallus surface, are margined by a thick
cortical border and have darkened medulla in the center
(Fig. 7 - 6). The shape and width of the lobes are also
very variable features in both species, dependent upon
microclimatic conditions during thallus development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCLUSIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@From the above studies it can be concluded that P.
colombiana and P. stictica are two closely related species
differing in: 1) the type of vegetative propagules, 2)
geographic distribution and 3) macroclimatic preferences.
Moreover, field observations in part of the area of sympatry
(Buenos Aires Province) showed that the two species appeared
to exhibit different habitat preferences: P. colombiana
growing mainly in protected sites whereas P. stictica
preferred vertical rock walls and stones in exposed /sit-
uations. Apparently P. stictica is more tolerant to environ-
mental stress.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These differences support the view that P. colombiana
and P. stictica represent two well delimited species, albeit
possibly derived from the same parent, Punctelia jujensis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@The study of the genus Phytophthora in mainland China
was reviewed. with emphasis on the historical background.
26 species of Phytophthora (3 new taxa) have been reported
in literature and the roles of some major species in
causing plant diseases were discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@REVIEW#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungal genus Phytophthora was established by de
Bary (1876) with P. infestans de Bary as the type species.
To date. over eighty different species of Phytophthora
have been described. Most of them are plant pathogens of
seed plants and their distribution is world-wide
(Zentmver. 1983). resulting in more than a thousand
combinations of host plant and Phytophthora. some of which
have attained the status of major epidemics (Gregory,
1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@China is one of the oldest and largest agricultural
countries in the world. A knowledge of the occurrence and
distribution of Phytophthora species and the plant
diseases caused by them is not only important for local
agriculture but would be of great interest to Phytophthora
researchers in other parts of the world. Unfortunately,
the information was often recorded in Chinese regional
periodicals not readily available to foreign scientists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A recent review has been completed by Ho (1990) to provide
a synopsis of studies on Taiwan Phytophthora in light of
current global information on this economically important
fungal genus. This paper is a paralle! review to provide
information on the genus Phytophthora in mainland China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In sharp contrast to Taiwan where the study of
Phytophthora was initiated and dominated by Sawada
resulting in the description of 22 species (16 new taxa)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Work was done while at the Department of Plant
Protection. Nanjing Agricultural University, China as
Visiting Professor.#Misc-exposition*]
[@94#Page-header*]

[@between 1911 and 1959 (Ho. 1990). no single researcher
dominated the field in mainland China. Nevertheless.
Professor F.L. Tai (1893-1973). as the undisputed Father
of Mycology in China was indeed the driving force behind
Phytophthora research in mainland China. Despite earlier
records of P. infestans on Solanum tuberosum L. in Beijing
of Hubei Province and Nanjing of Jiangsu Province (Miyake.
1913: Zhang. 1916: Tsou, 1922) his study on P. colocasiae
Rac. (Tai. 1923) causing blight of taro. Colocasiae
esculenta Schott in Guangzhou of Guandong Province is
widely accepted as the first investigation of Phytophthora
in mainland China (Xiang. 1983). He also recorded P.
colocasiae in Jiangsu Province (Tai. 1927) and P.
melongenae Sawada for the first time in mainland China
(Tai. 1936) and reported P. infestans on tomato and potato
in Yunnan Province (Tai. 1941). Under Tai's leadership.
the Plant Pathology Laboratory at the University of
Nanking became pre-eminent in the study of plant diseases
resulting in the discovery of six Phytophthora species in
Jiangsu Province: P. capsici Leonian on pepper fruit
(Capsicum frutescens L.), P. citrophthora (Sm. & Sm.)
Leonian on apricot trunk (Prunus armeniaca L.), P.
colocasiae on taro. P. infesteans on potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) and P. melongenae (=P. parasitica Dastur) on
eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) (Yu. 1940: Wei and Hwang.
1940). Wei (1939) also provided the first description of
P. citrophthora and P. parasitica Dastur as the causal
agent for brown rot of sweet oranges in Sichuan Province
(Ling. 1941) and studied P. parasitica causing tomato
fruit rot in Chengdu region (Wei and Chao. 1944).
Phytophthora diseases were also reported in other parts of
mainland, for example. P. parasitica on sweet oranges in
Guanxi Province (Huang. 1943) and P. infestans on potato
as well as P. melongenae on eggplant in Hunan Province
(Wang. 1950).#Misc-exposition*]

[@However. it was the epidemics of, late blight of
potato throughout the country in the early SO's that
brought forth a gush of interests on P.. infestans. The
dominating figure then was undoubtedly Dr. C.K. Lin. He.
along with Huang He and Liang Pingyen conducted pioneering
studies on the epidemiology and physiology of P.
infestans. Thus. Lin et al. 11955. 1956. 1957). Lin
(1961). Lin and Huang (1962). Huang and Lin (1961). Huang
(1962). and Huang er al. (1984) provided detailed analysis
of the disease initiation. spread. survival. forecast and
control in the field. Of course. other workers also made
important contributions in this regard (Wong and Wu. 1957:
Anonymous. 1960: Zhao. 1962: Zhang. 1964: Zhou and Lin.
1965; Zheng. 1980: Lin and Zhou. 1981: Cheng and Chang.
1985: He. 1986: Tsao et al. 1964: Xiao et al. 1992). To
understand the host-pathogen relationship. Liu and Zhang
(1962) first determined the conditions affecting the
resistance of potato tuber slices while Xiao and Huang
(1985: 1986) as well as Jiang and Shen (1985) evaluated
the role of rishitin in the resistance of potato to P.
infestans. Detailed studies of the physiological races of#Misc-exposition*]
[@95#Page-header*]

[@the pathogen and their virulence towards potato were also
conducted (Huang et a/.. 1981: Tang. 1987: Li. 1992). In
the study of the physiology of the fungus. Huang et al.
(1963) made the most significant contribution by
developing a synthetic medium for P. infestans and this
breakthrough made possible further studies on the
nutritional requirements of P. infestans and other
Phytophthora species (Huang et al.. 1965: 1930: 1987: Lin
and Liang, 1965). By substituting glucose with soluble
starch, Liang and Lin (1965) showed that P. infestans
could not utilize starch as the carbon source and this
ability to utilize starch could be used to differentiate
other Phytophthora species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The late 50's and early 60's also witnessed the
initiation of the study of Phytophthora bol! rot which
caused in many parts of China serious damage to the
quantity and quality of /cotton. an economically important
Chinese crop (Ji et al.. 1958; Anonymous. 1961).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pathogen was isolated and studied (Zhang et al.. 19635.
Deng et al.. 1964). but it was Liang (1964) who
unequivocally identified it as P. boehmeriae Sawada. which
also attacked the leaves of ramie in China (Qi et al..
1966: Zhou. 1984: Chen. 1986: Zhou. 1986: He. 1992: Cao et
al., 1993). Cotton boll rot disease was prevalent
throughout China (Zhang. 1983: 1985: Ding. 1986:
Anonymous. 1986; Ma and Shen. 1993) in provinces like
Sichuan (Tan and Li. 1988). Hebei (Zhang et al.. 1963:
Liang, 1964), Anhui (Zhang. 1985), Shaanxi (Qi and Yang.
1989): Shanxi (Liang. 1964: Ji and Fan. 1988: Li et al..
1992). Henan (Liang. 1964: Zhuang. 1981). Jiangsu. Jiangxi
(He, 1992), Zhejian (Zhu. 1982: Ge. 1991). Liaoning and
Hubei (Shen and Guo. 1987) as well as Beijing (Liang.
1964) and Shanghai regions (Zhang and Ma. 1980: Zhang and
Zhang, 1985). The pathogen survives in soil in the form
of Chlamydospores (Zhang et al.. 1981) or as oospores
(Zheng et al.. 1992d. Ma and Shen. 1992: He et al.. i993).
and stimulated by exudate of cotton boll (Wu et al..
1993). Cotton seedlings too. are thus susceptible to
damping-off by P. boehmeriae (Anonymous, 1974a. b: Ji and
Li. 1982: Tang. 1990: Ma and Shen. 1993). However. cotton
seedling blight in Xinjiang Province was caused by P.
drechsleri Tucker instead (Jia and Tang. 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a result of the destructive Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976), Phytophthora research was virtually suspended
during that period. but was resumed immediately in the
late 70's. blossoming in the S0's. Firstly. Wang and Lu
(1978) described a new pathogen. P. fragariae var.
oryzo-bladis causing leaf blight of rice seedlings early
in spring in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. and Wang and Lin
(1979) studied the biology of its zoospores in relation to
rice infection. The disease was also reported later in
Jiangxi. (Fan. 1981: Yi and Feng. 1986: Xu. 1989). Henan

Ho et al.. (1984d) demonstrated similar morphological and
cultural characteristics between P. melonis. P. sinensis
and P. drechsleri. Ho (1986) concluded that the pathogen
should be assigned to P. drechsleri which has priority.
The similarity was also noted by Li (1986) and
subsequently. the cucurbit pathogen was referred to as P.
drechsleri (Tang et al.. 1990b. 1991a, b: Jia. 1991: Yu.
1993) and the infection process. epidemic factors. and
control were studied (Tang et al.. 1992a. b. c). In some
cases. other Phytophthora species were also involved. For
instance. P. parasitica was recorded on cucumber in Jilin
Province (Qi et al.. 1966) and Guangzhou region (Cheng.
1980) and P. capsici was found on other cucurbits in
Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Xie. 1986). Gansu Province
(Tang et al.. 1990b: 1991b) and Guangdong Province (Cheng.
1992) along with P. drechsleri whereas Wang (1988)
isolated P. capsici from the roots but P. parasitica and
P. melonis from the vines of muskmelons in Xinjiang
Autonomous Region.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fruit rot of pepper caused by P. capsici was first
recorded by Yu (1940) in Jiangsu Province. but pepper

its viability rapidly (Wang et al.. 1990a). Yang and Shen

[@Phytophthora diseases of citrus was first reported by
Reinking (1921) as seedling blight in Southern China.
Phytophthora citrophthora and P. parasitica were later
isolated and described as the causal agents for brown rot
of sweet oranges. Citrus sinensis Osbeck in Storage in
Sichuan Province (Wei. 1939: Ling. 1941). Collar rot of
sweet oranges in Guangxi Province was also attributed to
P. parasitica (Huang. 1943) which also attacked Citrus

Fujian Province (Tai et al.. 1958). However. il was not
until the mid SO's when Yu et al. (1986a) conducted the
first systematic study of Phytophthora species on citrus

and P. palmivora from Hunan Province. You (1988) found
that citrus collar rot in Hunan Province was caused by P.
citrophthora and P. palmivora. Zheng (1989) reported six
species of Phytophthora from Sichuan Province: P.
boehmeriae. P. cactorum. P. citricola. P. citrophthora, P.

fall, stem canker and black stripe. The disease was
attributed to P. heveae and P. meadii (Tai. 1979) but
detailed information on the causal agents was lacking. Ho

plantations in Xishuangbanna of Yunnan Province and found
that P. citrophthora was by far the commonest species from
leaves. bark. fruit and soil whereas the other species
were P. palmivora from leaves and soil. P. cactorum from
leaves and P. colocasiae from soil although Yang and Liu
(1985) found no pathogenicity of the latter to Hevea by
artificial inoculation. Yu et a/. (1986b) expanded the
study to include Hainan Island and confirmed the
predominance of P. citrophthora which is the major
pathogen in rubber plantations in China. In addition to
P. palmivora and P. cactorum. P. capsici was found for the
first time on Heveae rubber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several new Phytophthora species. hitherto
unreported. also appeared in mainland China in the past
decade. Thus P. vignae Purss was reported on Vigna

leaves of Colocasia esculenta in Fujian Province. and P.
cryptogea Pethybr. & Laff. from the roots of Cedrus
deodara Loud. in Nanjing. Phytophthora palimivora (Butler)

tropical plant in Guangdong Province (Liang and Lin, 1965:
Lin et al.. 1981) was identified by Ho et al. (1983a) as
the pathogen attacking the leaves of chives. Allium
tuberosum Rottler in Beijing region; P. citricola was
found on citrus (Zhuang, 1981: Ho et al.. 1984e): P.

Cyperus malaccensis Lam. var. brevifolius Bocklr. in
Guangxi Province (Tai and Zhang. 1989: 1990; Zhang and
Tai. 1992). The pathogen causing the dying-back of many
black locust trees (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) in Jiangsu
Province as a result of stem rot or bark cankef deserves
special mention. It was initially identified as P.
cinnamomi Rands (Huang and Wang. 19383) but since the
isolates were different in some respects from other known
tvpical isolates of P. cinnamomi. they were treated as
atypical forms of P. cinnamomi (Ho et al.. 1983b). Later.
another new isolate was assigned to P. richardiae Buisman

[@Throughout the history of Phytophthora research in
mainland China. three centers of excellence distinguished
themselves. two in Beijing and one in Nanjing. At the
Department of Plant Protection, Beijing Agricultural
University. Dr. C.K. Lin and Liang Pingyen laid down the
foundation for the study of epidemiology (Lin et al..
1955; 1956; 1957; Lin. 1961: Lin and Huang. 1962: Liang,
1964) and nutritional requirements of Phytophthora (Lin
and Liang, 1965), with special emphasis on P. infestans
and P. boehmeriae. The starch utilization medium
developed by Liang and Lin (1965) continued to be used by
other Chinese workers in the identification of
Phytophthora species. Their pioneering work on
Phytophthora was continued by Shen Chongyao. a member of
the International Society of Plant Pathology Phytophthora
committee. The focus of research was on the
identification and biological characteristics of the
pathogen (Shen and Guo. 1987: Shen and Su. 1990: 1991;
Shen et al.. 1990a, b: Liu et al.. 1989a: Ma and Shen.
1993). Of special interest is the discovery of P.
megasperma on soybeans from Heilonjiang and Jilin
provinces as well as Beijing area (Su. 1991) and the
development of a new V-6 medium (Liu et al.. 1989b) to
replace the V-S8. widely used by Phytophthora researchers
but difficult to obtain in mainland China. Shen and his
students also began to develop other frontiers in
Phytophthora research. Thus Dou and Shen (1993) used
ELISA for rapid detection of P. megasperma. whereas
Yang (1992). Yang and Shen (1992) studied the stimulating
effects of plant and animal hormones on the sexual
reproduction of P. capsici as well as the soluble protein
patterns and isoenzymes of its mating types. For disease
control. the sensitivity of P. capsici to propamocarb and
metalaxy! was investigated (Li and Shen. 1993) and the
possibility of using Pvthium oligandrum as a biologica!
control of P. megasperma was explored (Su and Shen. 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the Institute of Microbiology. Academia Sinica at
Beijing. Huang He established himself early in the 1960's
as a major player in the study of Phytophthora physiology
by developing a synthetic medium for fastidious P.
infestans, (Huang et al... 1963). He further demonstrated
that the fungus. although almost unable to assimilate
nitrate. could utilize ammonium salt as the nitrogen
source. provided sufficient calcium and an organic acid
were available and the amount of mycekial growth of P.
infestans was similar to that obtained on natural media
(Huang et al.. 1965). The organic acid might serve as a
precursor for amino acids and the synthetic medium also
supported luxuriant growth of other Phytophthora species
(Huang et al.. 1987). To facilitate the storage of
cultures of Phrtophthora species. Nu and Huang (1987)
developed a simple apparatus for preserving them in liquid
nitrogen at ultra-low temperatures and found the viability#Misc-exposition*]
[@101#Page-header*]

[@of most cultures could be maintained for at least five
years (Huang and Xu. 1993). Beginning in the early 80's.
Yu Yongnian, a distinguished mycologist. noted especially
for his work on Pythium, turned his attention to
Phytophthora. with equal eminence. His research group
conducted the first study of the mating types of the
heterothallic species in Phytophthora known in mainland
China at that time (Ho et al.. 1983a. c). He and his
co-workers provided the most comprehensive studies of
citrus and Heveae rubber (Ho et al.. 1984a: Yu et al..
1986a. b). The master thesis and doctoral dissertation of
his students. Zhuang Wenying (1981) and Li Jinliang (1985)
stand, respectively. as the first and the most complete
taxonomic treatment of the genus Phytophthora to date in
mainland China. Yu (1993) compiled a list of Phytophthora
species and their hosts as well as geographical
distribution in China and believed that Phytophthora
should be placed in the family Phytophthoraceae instead of
Pythiaceae as usually accepted by most mycologists (Yu and
Liu. 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the Department of Plant Pathology. Nanjing
Agricultural-University (formerly. Plant Pathology
Laboratory. University of Nanking). the seed of
Phytophthora research was sown early by C.T. Wei and Dr.
T.F. Yu resulting in the elucidation of Phytophthora
diseases in Jiangsu and Sichuan provinces (Yu. 1940: Wei.
1939: Wei and Hwang. 1940). Then. Lu Jiayun became
interested in Phytophthora diseases in the late 70°s and
described P. fragariae var. orvzo-bladis as a new pathogen
causing rice seedling blight in Jiangsu Province (Wang and
Lu. 1978). As the Director of Plant Pathogen Institute.
she has special interest in the identification and biology
of Phytophthora species causing plant diseases (Lu et al..
1984). Thus the causal agents of cucumber blight (Lu and
Gong, 1982: Ho et al.. 1984d) and the blight of Cedrus
deodara seedlings (Ho et al.. 1984c: Xu et al.. 1990) in
Nanjing were determined. Xu Jingyou conducted a detailed
study of the trunk rot of black locust in Jiangsu Province
and concluded that P. robinicola sp. nov. was the single
most important pathogen (Xu er al.. 1990a) distinguished
not only by morphological characters but also br
electrophoresis patterns of soluble proteins and esterases
(Xu et al.. 1993). Zheng Xiabo studied the root rot
disease of Fuonvmus Jjaponice L. in Nanjing (Zheng and Lu.
1988d). compared the characteristics of numerous isolates
of P. nicotianae from China (Zheng and Lu. 1989a) and
performed comprehensive survey of Phytophthora species in
Fujian. Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces (Zheng and Lu.
1989b) as well as Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces
(Zheng and Lu. 1990c). To facilitate the production of
sporangia needed for species identification. Zheng and Lu
(1990b) developed a technique utilizing millipore-filtered
soil leachate. But it was the determination of the mating
types of heterothallic Phytophthora species primarily from
Nanjing (Ho et al.. 1984b: Lu et al., 1984) that
stimulated Lu's special interest in sexual reproduction#Misc-exposition*]
[@102#Page-header*]

[@and the genetics of Phytophthora (Xu et al., 1991). The
geographical distribution of the mating types of P.
cinnamomi in Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces (Lu
and Zheng. 1988) and eleven Phytophthora species in East
and Northeast China was determined (Zheng and Lu, 1990a).
The large collection of both heterothallic and homothallic
isolates of P. drechsleri from Nanjing area also served as
the focal point for genetic imvestigation into the nature
of sexuality of this species (Wang and Lu, 1988). Asa
prerequisite for the study of inheritance, techniques were
developed for single zoospore isolation (Zheng and Lu,
1991) and oospore germination (Zheng et al.. 1991: 1993).
Subsequently. the inheritance of biological characters and
mating types in P. drechsleri were investigated (Zheng and
Lu. 1992a. b; Zheng et al., 1992a). The selection of
mating pairs with double-marker. resistant and sensitive
to drugs (Zheng et al., 1992b) also permitted the study of
sexual behavior in P. drechsleri (Zheng et al.. 1992c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new species of Gliocladiopsis with penicillate and subverticillate
conidiophores and irregularly curved 1-septate conidia is described from soil
as G. irregularis. The variation present in the vesicle morphology of
Cylindrocladium spathiphylli is discussed, and a previously unknown
microconidial state reported.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Gliocladiopsis Saksena (1954) was erected for species with
hyaline, cylindrical conidia borne in slimy masses on whorls of phialides on
penicillate conidiophores. This genus is presently monotypic, and the type
species, G. sagariensis Saksena was shown to be synonymous with the
earlier described Cylindrocarpon tenue Bugn. (Agnihothrudu, 1959).
Barron (1968), however, regarded the genus as a later synonym of
Cylindrocladium Morgan. Crous & Wingfield (1993) stated that
Gliocladiopsis should be retained for species with penicillate conidiophores
lacking, stipe extensions and terminal vesicles as commonly found in
Cylindrocladium and Cylindrocladiella Boesewinkel. Based on the
converging branching pattern of the penicillate conidiophores, the genus
Cylindrocarpon was also found unsuitable. C. tenue was subsequently
placed in G/iocladiopsis as G. tenuis (Bugn.) Crous & M.J. Wingf., with C.
sagariensis as synonym. Watanabe (1994) stated, however, that because
several species of Cylindrocladium and Cylindrocladiella lose their ability to
produce stipe extensions in culture, this is not a stable criterium to separate#Misc-exposition*]
[@120#Page-header*]

[@these genera. Cylindrocarpon tenue was subsequently transferred to
Cylindrocladium. Other studies on Cylindrocladium and Cylindrocladiella
(Crous & Wingfield, 1993; 1994) showed that all species in these two genera
do in fact produce stipe extensions on penicillate conidiophores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Watanabe (1994) also regarded Cylindrocladium intermedium Matsushima
to be a synonym of Gliocladiopsis tenuis. However, the latter species was
described with conidia being 20-30 x 1.6-2.8 µm (Matsushima, 1971), which
is larger than any conidial measurement ever published for G. tenuis (Crous
& Wingfield, 1993), or those obtained in the present study (Table 1).
Although C. intermedium is probably better accommodated in Gliocladiopsis

[@One strain (STE-U 636) isolated from Chamaedorea elegans in the USA has
conidia which are (16-)22(-26) x 1.5(-2) µm and 1(-3)-septate. Although
these conidia have more septa and are slightly longer than those of the other
strains sporulating on CLA, we are hesitant to describe this as a new taxon,
and are of the opinion that additional collections or molecular techniques
would be required to support such a decision. Although conidial dimensions
and septation is a good indication of species limits in Cy/indrocladium, some
strains of species such as C. ovatum El-Gholl et al. and C. spathiphylli
Schoulties et a/. have been collected that form only one conidial septum,
whereas others, as in the case of G/iocladiopsis strain STE-U 636, can form
up to three.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gliocladiopsis strains (Table 1) were mated in all possible combinations

probably be required to elucidate relatedness amoung the genera
Gliocladiopsis, Cylindrocladium and Cylindrocladiella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cylindrocladium spathiphylli Fig. 2.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1972 the second author collected a Cy/indrocladium species from
Camellia sinensis L. in Mauritius, which was subsequently lodged at IMI.
In an examination of this specimen (Crous ef a/., 1991), globose vesicles and
3-septate conidia were observed. Several years after this isolate was
collected, Schoulties et a/. (1982) described a species with |-septate conidia
and similar vesicle morphology from Spathiphyllum as C. spathiphylli.
Uchida & Aragaki (1992) reported, however, that this species could have 1-
3-septate conidia with sphaeropedunculate, ellipsoid or spathulate vesicles.
El-Gholl ef a/. (1992) subsequently described the heterothallic teleomorph as
Calonectria spathiphylli El-Gholl et al. Furthermore, additional hosts such
as Heliconia, Ludwigia and Strelitzia were reported for this species, while
Crous & Wingfield (1994) also listed it on Araucaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Mauritian isolate (IMI 167983) has conidia which are (1-)3-septate,
(55-)90(-120) x (6-)6.5(-7) µm. El-Gholl et a/. (1992) reported that cultures
of C. spathiphylli were primarily 1(-3)-septate, 39-148 x 4.5-8 µm, thus
corresponding, with our isolate. Furthermore, IMI 167983 also produced a
distinct microconidial state on CLA. Conidia are 1-septate, (32-)39(-50) x
(3.5-)4(-5) µm, and form on straight cylindrical to allantoid phialides, 10-26
x 3-3.5 µm. No microconidial vesicles were, however, observed. This is the
first report of a microconidial state for C. spathiphylli, and a new host and
geographic record for the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolate IMI 167983 was mated with several predetermined tester strains of C.
spathiphylli (El-Gholl et al., 1992), namely P87-0167 (+, from Heliconia),

be a (+) mating type, and a strain of C. spathiphylli. lt can therefore be
accepted that although vesicle morphology is characteristic of the various
species of Cylindrocladium, some species are characterized by a certain
amount of variation in their vesicles, as has also been reported for C.
variabile Crous et al. (Crous et al., 1993b). Further studies on the various
species complexes using a combination of molecular techniques and sexual
compatibility are required, therefore, to determine the amount of variation
acceptable within each biological species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The formation of microconidial states in Cylindrocladium is poorly
understood (Crous & Wingfield, 1994). Although these states are much less
common than in morphologically similar genera such as Cylindrocarpon
Wollenw. and Fusarium Link, some species of Cylindrocladium are nearly
always isolated with both conidial types (C. ovatum, C. pteridis Wolf, C.
variabile), whereas this is rarely observed in others (Peerally, 1991; Crous &
Wingfield, 1994). In the case of strain IMI 167983 of C. spathiphylli, it
would seem that long term preservation induced the ability to form both
conidial states, as has also been observed for strain CBS 190.50 of C.
parasiticum Crous et al. (Crous et al., 1993c). This suggests, therefore, that
the formation of microconidia in some species of Cylindrocladium may only
be due to unfavourable conditions, and be of little value as an additional
taxonomic feature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the Second General Survey of the Natural Environment of the Ogasawara (Bonin)
Islands (1990-1991) many specimens of polypores were collected by the senior author
and other mycologists. Among them 2 species of Phellinus did not key out in either the
world monograph of Phellinus by Larsen & Cobb-Poulle (1990), the key of Malaysian
species of xanthochroic polypores by Corner (1991) or in other literature on polypores.
We conclude that these 2 specics are undescribed and the names Phellinus macroferreus,
P. velutinus are proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dricd specimens were examined both macroscopically and microscopically. Cultures of
P. macroferreus were grown at 25 °C in the dark on PDA (Eiken Chem Co. Ltd.). The
effect of temperature on mycelial growth was established by incubation at constant

(1991) described a number of Phellinus spp. including 15 new taxa from Malaysia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phellinus macroferreus is characterized by the apparently pileate basidiocarps,
subulate setae, and cylindrical spores. Phellinus ferreus (Pers.) Bourd. & Galz., with
same type of spores and setae, is probably the most closely related specics. Nevertheless,
this specics always has a resupinate basidiocarp while P. macroferreus has a pileate and
ungulate to triquctrous basidiocarp. Phellinus tawhai (Cunn.) Cunn., endemic in New
Zealand, also has the same type of spores and setae. Basidiocarps of this species are
effused-reflexed with numerous nodose pilei arising from a broad resupinate foot
according to Cunningham (1965) while those of P. macroferreus are cffused-reflexed
with a single large pileus. Besides, basidiospores of P. tawhai are smaller (5-6 x 1.5-2
m) than those of P. macroferreus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phellinus cinchonensis (Murr.) Ryv. has a scmi-applanate to ungulate
basidiocarp, subulate setae and cylindrical spores as in P. macroferreus. But the former
species has a light basidiocarp, fragile tubes and a radially fibrous context according to
Lowe (1957) and Ryvarden & Johansen (1980) while P. macroferreus has a heavy
basidiocarp and woody hard context and tubes. Furthermore, basidiospores of the former
species are wider (2.5-3 µm wide) and gencrally more oblong cllipsoid than strictly
cylindrical. Phellinus cylindrosporus Ryv., described by Ryvarden (1987) from Panama,
also has a pileate basidiocarp, cylindrical basidiospores and abundant setae, but this
species differs from P. macroferreus in its basidiocarps with a strongly contracted base
and strongly zonate surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phellinus velutinus is characterized by an entirely resupinate basidiocarp, soft
spongy tubes, long subulate setae and abundant setal hyphac. Phellinus palmicola (Berk.

which is small in P. velutinus and very large in P. palmicola, and in the presence of setal
hyphac which are abundant both in thc context and trama of thc former species and absent
in P. palmicola. Besides, P. palmicola is known only from palms according to Gilbertson
& Ryvarden (1987) while both collections of P. velutinus were on angiosperms. Both P.
contiguus (Fr.) Pat. and P. rufitinctus (Cke) Pat. also have resupinate basidiocarps,
subulate to subventricose setae, abundant setal hyphae and ellipsoid and hyaline spores
but the consistency of the basidiocarps is much harder than in P. velutinus. In addition,
P. contiguus has much larger pores and P. rufitinctus has smaller basidiospores.
Phellinus lamaensis (Murr.) Heim (holotype, NY!) sometimes has a resupinate
basidiocarp, with sctal hyphae and sctac. However, it has much shorter hymenial sctac
(rarely above 25 µm long), its basidiospores are obovate and wider (3.5-5 x 2.5-3.5 µm)
and its tubes are very rigid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Phaeoramularia Muntafola currently contains well over
seventy species and new taxa continue to be added to it (Singh, Chaudhary and
Morgan-Jones, 1995). Seventeen novel species have been described from the
Indian subcontinent during the past twenty years and there undoubtedly exist
many others that remain to be discovered. Comments were made by Singh et al.
(loc. cit.) on the state of the genus and in particular on the matter of taxonomic
concepts where host association, as well as morphological distinctions, play a
role in differentiating species. Although very many of the described species
bear similarity to each other, morphological differences and conidiophore and
conidium dimensions, as "well as host relationships, serve to effectively
distinguish most of the various taxa. In the present publication three further
hitherto undescribed species, one from the Terai belt, between the river Ganges
and the foothills of the Himalayas, in northeastern Uttar Pradesh, India, the
others from Nepal, are treated. Infection by all three results in necrotic leaf-
spot symptoms on their respective host leaves.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phaeoramularia ficina is readily distinguishable from other described

[@Phaeoramularia calotropicola is easily identifiable from other species of
the genus by a combination of overall morphology and conidium length. In regard
to the latter characteristic it resembles P. plucheae (Petrak & Ciferri)
Deighton [= Cercospora plucheae Petrak & Ciferri], which causes pale brown
necrotic lesions on leaves of Pluchea odorata Cass., a member of the
Asteraceae (Petrak and Ciferri, 1930). The conidiophores in that species are
also quite long (Ellis, 1976). Another species of Phaeoramularia, namely P.
calotropidis (Ell. & Everh.) Kamal, Moses & R. Chaudhary [= Cercospora
calotropidis Ell. & Everh.] is known to occur on a different species of
Calotropis R. Br. This taxon causes blackish lesions on leaves of Calotropis
procera (Aiton) Dryander ex W.T. Aiton (Kamal et al., 1990). Phaeoramularia
calotropicola, although morphologically somewhat similar, differs from it
mainly in having less well-developed stromata and larger conidiophore and
conidium dimensions, particularly length. Caespituli in P. calotropidis are
produced amphigenously in contrast to those of P. calotropicola, which are
always produced hypophyllously. Two further species of Phaeoramularia have
hosts belonging to the phanerogamic plant family Asclepiadaceae. Both
Phaeoramularia leptadeniae, mentioned earlier, and P. pergulariae Dublish &
Singh, which occurs on Pergularia daemia Chiov., are morphologically
distinguishable from each other (Chiddarwar, 1960; Dublish and Singh, 1977)

be placed in the Family Parmeliaceae (Eriksson &
Hawksworth, 1987; Yoshimura, 1987; Calvelo &
Adler, 1992) considering the ontogeny of the
ascocarp (Henssen et al., 1981) and spongiostra-
tum (Henssen & Dobelmann, 1987) and the type of
conidial formation (Yoshimura, 1987). Anyhow,
some authors place Anzia in Anziaceae (Poelt,
1973; Hale, 1983) and Elix (1993) considers that
there is still “some contention whether or not
Anzia should be included in the Parmeliaceae".#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the original description of the species
Anzia afromontana (Santesson, 1986) various loca-
lities in East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania and Ethio-
pia) were reported. Its presence was also
recorded from South America (Chile) but without
any reference to the locality of collection,
since the author had not examined material from
this last country (Santesson, pers. comm.).
Later, Uganda was added to the distribution in
Africa (Swinscow & Krog, 1988).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Here, the results of studies on material of
Anzia afromontana specimens from southern South-
America and Africa are presented, as well as a
discussion regarding the presence of the genus
Anzia in Argentina and Chile.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks on types of soralia: The comparison
between specimens from Africa, Argentina and
Chile showed that the material from South America
has a differential character since it presents
two types of soralia:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type 1- orbicular, laminar soralia, "start-
ing as small white points on the upper side of
distal lobes, penetrating the cortex and finally
forming  urn-shaped structures with sorediate
inner surface" (Figs. 2 and 3), as those describ-
ed in the species diagnosis (Santesson, 1986).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type 2- soralia starting as globose out-
growths of the apices of laciniae, expanding to
large protuberances and finally bursting out on
the lower surface, to form globose ventral sora-
lia (Figs. 4 and 5). They can be considered as a
type of "cuff" soralia described by Yoshimura
(1987). Not observed on material from Africa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the remaining morphological, anatomical
and chemical characteristics are coincident with
those of Anzia afromontana, this second type of
soralia is here considered within the intraspeci-
fic variability, even when sorediate propagules
are considered an appropriate character to segre-
gate species (Yoshimura, 1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anzia americana Yoshimura & Sharp, described
from Mexican Highlands southeastern United States
(Yoshimura & Sharp, 1968), has also ventral sora-
lia but they are formed directly over the lower
surface and do not have globose shape, being very
easy to distinguish one from the other.#Misc-exposition*]

[@: : Anzia afromontana has a
very particular disjunct distribution, having
been found in Africa and southern South-America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The South-American specimens of Anzia
afromontana are typical for the Valdivian rain-
forest on both sides of the Andes. They have been
collected in Lago Puelo National Park (Argentina)
153#Page-header*]

[@and Vicente Pérez Rosales National Park (Chile)
at ca. 41° S and 300 m altitude and in Laguna San
Rafael National Park (Chile) at ca. 46° 5
(Galloway, 1992). The three areas are covered
with temperate rainforest, with high, open canopy
typically formed by Drymis winteri, Lomatia fe-
rruginea, Embothrium coccineum and one of the two
vicariant trees, Nothofagus dombeyi or Nothofagus
betuloides. The understory is shrubby with
Chusquea spp. (Bambusoideae), epiphytes and lia-
nas. The African collections, were made in tro-
pical rainforests, between 1? N and 3? S near the
equator and at much higher altitudes (between
2000 and 3300 m). Some of them have also been re-
ported from areas with vegetation of bamboo
(Santesson, 1986 and in schaeda). The distribu-
tion shows the typical inverse correlation
between altitude and degree of latitude (Begon et
al., 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taxonomical remarks: Lamb (1958) made a new
combination for Pannoparmelia anzioides (Darbi-
shire, 1912) as Anzia anzioides (Darb.) Lamb.
Under this name he reported the species from
Argentina (Lamb, 1958) and Redón (1974) from Chi-
le. Therefore the genus Anzia was included in the
lichen flora of Argentina and Chile.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since Anzia and Pannoparmelia are currently
widely accepted as two different genera (Gallo-
way, 1978; Eriksson, 1984; Eriksson & Hawksworth,
1993; Yoshimura, 1987; Adler & Calvelo, 1993;
Elix, 1993), it is here considered that Anzia
anzioides (Darb.) Lamb belongs to Pannoparmelia
and should be treated as Pannoparmelia anzioides
Darb. Therefore, there had been no real reports
of Anzia species for southern South-America be-
fore the publication of Anzia afromontana for
Chile (Santesson, 1986), afterwards confirmed for
Chile (Galloway, 1992) and the present report for
Argentina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is concluded that this is the first
actual mention of Anzia s.str. for Argentina, and#Misc-exposition*]
[@154#Page-header*]

[@that Anzia afromontana is the only species of the
genus known from Argentina and Chile so far.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Six new Tolyposporium species are described on members of Cyperaceae
from Australia: T. mesomelaenae Websdane & K. Vänky (type on

Websdane & K. Vänky (holotype on Cyathochaeta avenacea Benth., paratype
on C. clandestina (R. Br.) Benth.). A further Tolyposporium on Mesomelaena
stygia (R. Br.) Nees, with a great variability and irregularity of the spores
and spore balls, is also presented. The possible causes of the occurence of
anomalous spores and spore balls between "reqular" spore balls, observed in
some other Tolyposporium too (though in small percentage), are discussed. A
key to the 18 known Tolyposporium species on Cyperaceae is given.#Misc-exposition*]



[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@"Australia's fungal flora has been poorly researched and documented to date. At
a time when the importance of biodiversity is being recognised, the fungi stand
out as one of the most poorly known groups of organisms. It has been estimated
that there are over 250 000 species of fungi in Australia of which we probably
know fewer than five per cent" (Pascoe apud Kile & Grgurinovic, 1995:29). The
ca. 130 species of Ustilaginales, known from Australia, probably also represent
only a small part of the existing species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS 2#Page-header*]

[@For microscopical studies dried specimens were used. Light microscope (LM)
with an oil immersion lens, at a magnification of 1000 x was used for studies of
spore morphology and measurements. For this purpose dried spores were soaked
in lactophenol by gentle heating to the boiling point. Black spore balls were
bleached in concentrated hydrogen peroxide for 10-30 minutes to permit
examination of the spore ball structure, the shape of the spores and counting of
the spores in the balls. Because the treatment of the spores with hydrogen
peroxide swells up the walls, no measurements were done on such bleached
spores. For studies of the sorus structure and spore ball formation, 0.5 µm thick
sections of young sori embedded in plastic were prepared by the standard
technique for TEM preparations, and stained with new fuchsin — crystal violet.
For scanning electronmicroscopical (SEM) studies, dried spores were dusted on
small pieces of double-sided adhesive tape and sputter-coated with
gold-palladium, ca. 20 nm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Studies of smutted Cyperaceae from South and Western Australia resulted in the
recognition of several unknown  Ustilaginales belonging to the genus
Tolyposporium, of which some are described in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Tolyposporium Woronin ex Schróter, 1887:276 (type: T. junci (Schróter)
Woronin ex Schréter on Juncus bufonius L.), is characterised by mainly "external"
(not within the host tissues) sori in floral parts, flowers or on vegetative parts of
the host plant, forming agglutinated or granular-powdery, black masses of spore
balls, Spore balls are composed of few to many, firmly agglutinated,
dark-coloured spores. There are no sterile cells in the balls or between them.
Spore germination is of Ustilago-type. Known species ca. 20, on Cyperaceae,
Juncaceae and ?Restionaceae (comp. Vánky, 1987:116).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Mesomelaena Nees (Cyperaceae) consists of five species endemic to
the south-west of Western Australia (Wilson, 1981). Smut fungi have been found
on three of these species, namely, M. pseudostygia (IKük.) K. L. Wilson, M.
graciliceps (C. B. Clarke) K. L. Wilson, and M. stygia (R. Br.) Nees. On the first
two species two undescribed Tolyposporium species could be identified. On the
third species a Tolyposporium was found which is interpreted as a hybrid between
the smut of M. graciliceps and an unknown smut fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

semiagglutinated or granular-powdery mass of spore balls completely hidden by
the glumes, evident only after dissection of the spikelets. Infection systemic; all
inflorescences of a plant and all spikelets of an inflorescence being affected.
Spore balls (Figs. 10, 11) variable, subglobose, ovoid, elongated or irregular,
30—70(-80) x 35—100(—150) µm, blackish-brown, opaque, composed of tens to
one hundred or more firmly united subcuneiform spores. A certain percentage of
the spore balls is quite different from the regular balls in possessing loosely
arranged, globoid, ellipsoidal, lemon-shaped or obovoid spores often with a
narrow, pedicel-like part toward the centre of the spore balls. In some spore
balls both kinds of spores are visible or half of a ball is regular, the other half is
irregular. In other cases such hemiglobose spores may be single or they are
attached to the surface of "regular" spore balls. Spore balls from different sori
may show anomalous balls in different percentage. Spores from "regular" balls
are cuneiform or subcuneiform, 9—25 µm long, the free surface is polygonal,
7-11.5 x 9.5-15 µm, dull-brown; wall of free surface 1.5—5 µm thick, irregularly
verrucose, contact walls thin (0.5—1.5 tum), smooth. Spores from irregular balls
have unevenly thickened, 1.5—8 µm wide, smooth to finely verruculose wall.#Description*]

[@Based on the "regular" spore balls and spores, this collection may belong to
Tolyposporium melanosporum (opus ipsum). The place of collection of these two
smuts is also identical. However, because of the irregularity and variability of
the spore balls and spores, this collection could also represent a hybrid (between
T. melanosporum and an unknown smut). Hybrid smut fungi are not uncommon in
nature and were also obtained under laboratory conditions between rather widely
different species (comp. chapter Hybridization, mutation, and genetics, Fischer
& Holton, 1957:293-330). Another interpretation of the occurence of loosely
connected, globoid spores would be that external factor/s are disturbing the
spore ball building and a spore, a group of spores or part of a spore ball escape
from the coherence and mutual pressure of other spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The morphological study of the dark spore walls and strongly agglutinated,
opaque spores in LM is very difficult. After treating the spore balls with conc.
hydrogen peroxide for 15—30 minutes, the spores become lighter and separate
easily. However, one should not forget that spores, especially the spore walls,
treated in such a way swell considerably. The spore and spore wall measurements
given above refer to untreated spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@During my work on the local lichen floras of the Putorana Plateau and
Taymyr Peninsula (Zhurbenko 1989, 1992a,b, 1993a,b), it became evident
that summarizing present knowledge of the lichen flora of the northern
Krasnoyarsk Territory would be helpful since it would provide baseline
information and stimulate further studies in the area. This list is also a
contribution to the compilation of the Panarctic mycobiota, a project now
being promoted in many arctic countries. The distributions of some taxa
were discussed in previous studies by Chernov & Matveeva (1979) and#Misc-exposition*]

[@Krasnoyarsk Territory is a vast area covering most of Central Siberia. The
North Krasnoyarsk Territory lies within the boundaries of the Taymyrskiy
avtonomnyy Okrug (Fig. 1). At its southern edge it includes the northern
part of the Central Siberian Plateau, and extends to the Severnaya Zemlya
Archipelago and the other islands of the Kara and Laptev Seas to the north.
The western boundary of the area studied lies east of the Yenisey River, and
the eastern between the Popigay and Anabar Rivers. Preobrazheniya Island,
referred to as the Sakha-Yakutiya Republic, is also included. Lichen reports
from the Arctic Yakutiya situated east of the area discussed here, is found in
a comprehensive compilation by Fes’ko (1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first scientific lichen collections from the area were made by A. T.
Middendorff, who in a expedition in 1843 crossed the Taymyr Peninsula
from Dudinka to the mouth of the Nizhnyaya Taymyra River. The material
was identified by Nylander (1867). Numerous lichen specimens from the
region of the lower Yenisey, e.g. from Dudinka, Tolstyy Nos, Nikandrovskie
Islands, were collected in 1876 by Marten M. Brenner. This interesting
material has only rarely been reported on in some publications, c.g. by
Magnusson (1944, 1947, 1950), and was deposited in different herbaria (H,
GB, S, UPS).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first significant contributions to the knowledge of Taymyr lichens
were made by sea-based expeditions along the polar coast of Siberia, first of
all by the Nordenskióld expedition with "Vega" in 1878-79 and E. V. Toll's
expedition with "Zarya" in 1900-01 (Almquist 1882; Elenkin 1906, 1909;
Lynge 1929; Magnusson 1944, 1947; Malme 1932; Savicz 1916). In 1930
extensive collections from the Severnaya Zemlya and the Visz Islands were
made by V. P. Savicz. Unfortunately this material was never identified, and
the first report of lichens of Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago was not
published until in 1958 by Korotkevich.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the lichen flora of coastal areas of the Taymyr Peninsula and
the adjacent islands thus is comparatively well-documented, the mainland
territories have for long remained practically unexplored. Some information
about common lichens of the interior regions of the Taymyr Peninsula was
between 1910 and 1940 obtained by expeditions of Pereselencheskoe
Upravlenie (the Migration Ministry) and other institutions during
investigations of natural resources of the northern areas (Alexandrova 1937;
Avramtchik 1937; Kuznetsov 1916,1932; Sambuk 1937; Tyulina 1937;
Vinogradova 1937). Further contributions to the knowledge of the#Misc-exposition*]
[@188#Page-header*]

[@distribution of lichens prominent in the vegetation of the area were made in
applied geobotanical investigations, e.g. of reindeer pastures. These studies
were primarily carried out by investigators of the Institute of Agriculture at
the Extreme North (Anonymous 1975, Kuvajev et al. 1974, Shchelkunova
1979). Valuable information on the older reports can be found in Oxner
(1940-1942) and Savicz & Elenkin (1950).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The next period of lichenological studies in the area began in the late
1960s as a part of comprehensive biological investigations at a number of
semi-permanent research stations such as Tareya, Agapa, Ary-Mas,
Putorana, and Mys Baranova. These studies, carried out under the
leadership of the Polar Expedition, Komarov Botanical Institute, benefited
greatly from international collaboration (Ahti & Zhurbenko 1994; Andreev
et al. 1993; Kotlov 1993a,b,c; Moberg & Zhurbenko 1994; Piin 1977a,b,

[@The present list of lichens and lichenicolous fungi of the northern
Krasnoyarsk Territory shows that the area still is insufficiently explored
lichenologically. Most of the collections have so far been made by non-
lichenologists. The localities studied are predominantly situated along the
coast of the Taymyr Peninsula, the Pyasina River, and in the northwestern
Putorana Plateau area. The vast interior areas of the Taymyr Peninsula,
particularly the Byrranga Mountains and the territories east of the Ayan,
Kheta and Khatanga Rivers are virtually unstudied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The list presented here was compiled from literature records and results
from studies of material from 53 localities. The majority of the lichen
specimens collected from this area are housed in St.-Petersburg (LE), Tartu
(?) (TU), Tallinn (TALL) [abbreviations follow Holmgren ez al. (1990)].
Material from the Vega (1878-1879) and Maud (1918-1925) expeditions are
deposited mainly in Stockholm (S) and Oslo (O). Some material is located in
Bergen (BG), Ottawa (CANL), Copenhagen (C), Essen (ESS), Graz

[@AREA STUDIED#Misc-exposition*]

[@The northern Krasnoyarsk Territory includes both the vast boggy plain areas
of the Northern Siberian Lowland and major mountain systems.
Mountainous areas include the northern part of the Central Siberian
Plateau with the Putorana Plateau (elevations of up to 1701 m) and the
Anabar Mountains (elevations of up to 905 m), the Byrranga Mountains in
the northern part of the Taymyr Peninsula (highest peak at 1146 m) and the
mountains of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago covered mostly by glaciers
(elevations up to 965 m).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the area is influenced by the continental Siberian climate; only the
western part of the Taymyr Peninsula, adjacent to the Yenisey River and its
gulf, has a climate with maritime influence (Treshnikov 1985). The area
north of the Krasnoyarsk Territory is situated within the zone of continuous
permafrost. The vegetation in the northern part of the territory is strongly
influenced by frost. Some climatic data of different vegetation zones from
the Taymyr Peninsula and adjacent areas are presented in Table 1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The northern Krasnoyarsk Territory lies mostly within the arctic floristic
division of the East-Siberian Province, Taymyr Subprovince (Yurtsev er al.
1978). The vegetation of the subarctic highlands, as exemplified by the
Putorana Plateau, is divided into three distinct altitudinal belts (Norin
1986). The lower belt of northern taiga (NT) is composed mainly of Larix
sibirica and L. gmelinii forests. The subalpine belt (SA) is dominated by
Duschekia fruticosa and Betula nana shrubs. The alpine tundra belt (AIT) at
the upper levels of the plateau (altitudes 800-1300 m), is represented by
communities mostly dominated by Dryas punctata and Cassiope tetragona
combined with a patchy plant cover and stone fields mostly inhabited by
crustaceous lichens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Northwards of the Central Siberian Plateau lies a transitional zone of
forest-tundra (FT), dominated by such species as Larix gmelinü, Empetrum
subholarcticum, Dryas punctata, Ledum palustre, Vaccinium vitis-idaea s.l.,
Cladina spp., Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens v. alaskanum,
Ptilidium ciliare.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The tundra zone of the Taymyr Peninsula is subdivided here according
to Chernov & Matveeva (1979). Its southern (or shrub) tundra subzone (ST)
is characterized by closed shrub vegetation in upland type tundras. Species
frequnetly dominating are Duschekia fruticosa, Betula nana, Salix lanata,
Vaccinium uliginosum s.l, V. vitis-idaea s.l, Rubus chamaemorus, Arctous
alpinus, Empetrum subholarcticum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The subzone of typical tundra (TT), or moss tundra, is characterized by
dominance of dwarf-shrubs (Dryas punctata, Cassiope tetragona), sedges,
bryophytes (Hylocomium splendens v. alaskanum, Aulacomnium turgidum,
Tomenthypnum nitens) and partially in upland tundras by lichens. A
bryophyte understory is a dominant feature of the plant communities and
provides continuous vegetation coverage. Shrubs (Salix reptans, S. arctica)
also occur in upland tundras, but never form close stands and usually have a
prostrate form.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Arctic tundra subzone (AT) is characterized by a disrupted, net-
like plant coverage resulting in polygonal and spotty tundras dominated by,
e.g. Salix polaris, Luzula confusa, Alopecurus alpinus, Papaver polare,
Hylocomium splendens v. alaskanum, Aulacomnium turgidum, Tomenthypnum
nitens and various lichens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The polar desert zone (PD) (sensu Alexandrova 1983) covers the
northern extremity of the Taymyr Peninsula with Cape Chelyuskin, the
Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago and some other northern islands in the Kara
and Laptev Seas. It is characterized by a significant reduction of the plant
cover (ranges usually from 5 to 30%), and a strong patchiness. Dominating
plants are lichens and bryophytes, but never phanerogams. The cushion-
plant life form is very common here.#Misc-exposition*]

Scutellinia phymatodeus S. C. Kaushal & R. Kaushal for the similarly
apiculate ascospores of the former and similar tuberculate ascospore
ornamentation of the latter. The examination of the type material of
these taxa has confirmed mutually different characteristics. Relations to
several other species of the genus are also discussed. Another 6 species
of Scutellinia are reported from New Zealand for the first time. Notes

[@Apothecia 2-4(-5) mm diam., gregarious, sessile, rounded,  cupulate, then
shallowly cupulate to almost discoid, hymenium pale to dark orange-red, outer
surface and margin densely covered by very short, dark brown hairs. Hairs short,
60-270(-285) x 12-21.5 µm, light to dark brown, rigid, thick-walled (walls 3-4.5
µm thick), usually 1-3 septate, straight or often curved or flexuous, acuminate
above, narrowing towards the base; the base bifurcate to short and narrow roots
or usually simple, truncate, or usually attenuated to a subacute end of a similar
shape like the upper acute part ("bicuspidate"). Excipulum clearly differentiated:
ectal excipulum of textura globulosa-angularis comprising hyaline, large,
subglobose to angular cells which are 20-75 µm in diam. and elongated and
clavate in the margin of the apothecia; medullary excipulum of textura intricata,
comprising interwoven, septate, usually inflated hyphae (6-15 «µm in diam.)
which grade towards smaller hyphae of the indistinctly differentiated
subhymenium. Asci 250-280 x 10-12 gm, cylindrical, rounded above,
operculated, attenuated towards the simple base, eight-spored. Ascospores
ellipsoid, 13.5-16.5(-17.6) x 7.5- 10.5(-11) µm (excluding the ornamentation and
apiculi), usually 16 x 9 µm but also 15 x 10.5 µm, containing several guttules
which are of an unequal size, ornamented by large cyanophilic warts and
tubercles which measure 1.5-4.5 µm and are mostly rounded, isolated or
occasionally mutually attached or connected by thin buckles; on the ascospore
poles, the cyanophilic tubercles are usually arranged inside irregular appendages
as they are coated by an outermost sheath, forming thus conspicuous apiculi
which are up to 10.5 µm high (oil immersion and stained by CB Geigy s. 123
without heating the slides). Paraphyses filiform, 2-3 µm thick, not or slightly
enlarged to 3.5-7.5 µm at their tips, containing orange granules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new species is well characterized by its small apothecia having the outer
surface and the margin densely covered by very short brown hairs, which,
especially those in the lower part of the excipulum, are occasionally attenuated
towards a subacute base, and thus, they may resemble the hairs in the genus
Trichophaeopsis Korf & Erb. The most remarkable feature of the new species are
the apiculate ascospores possessing tuberculate ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the genus Scutellinia (Cooke) Lamb., recently monographed by Schumacher
(1990), we can find similarly apiculated ascospores in Scutellinia geneospora
(Berk.) O. Kuntze - a rare species known only from India, Indonesia and Japan.
However, the examination of the holotype (K, as Peziza geneospora Berk.) has
revealed that the Asian species is clearly distinguished by much longer and wider
hairs and also by much larger ascospores. The hairs of the holotype measure
(110-)400-955 x 22-45 µm, and the mature ascospores measure (18-) 21-24.5
(-25.5) x 12-15(-16) µm (excluding the ornamentation and apiculi). Moreover,
the ascospore warts are mostly of a more irregular shape, and the space inside the
cyanophilic sheath of the follicle-like apiculi is often conspicuously transparent.#Misc-exposition*]

[@238#Page-header*]

[@However, in a certain number of ascospores of both species a similar type of
apiculi occurs and thus we may speculate whether these two species may be
accommodated in the same section of the genus Scutellinia, supposedly in the
section Geneospermae (Rifai) T. Schumacher (1990) which, after the
Schumachers recombination, replaced the previously erected genus
Geneosperma Rifai (1968). However, the taxonomic value of the similar type of
ascospores of these two species, which is a leading character for such
supposition, is decreased by another important feature - the very different size
and shape of hairs. S. totaranuiensis has therefore an outstanding position in the
genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nevertheless, also several features of Scutellinia phymatodeus S. C. Kaushal &
R. Kaushal in S. C. Kaushal, R. Kaushal & Ravla (1983), particularly the short
hairs and similar tuberculate ascospore ornamentation, may indicate a close
relationship to S. «otaranuiensis. However, the reexamination of the isotype
(J. Mor.) has confirmed that S. phymatodeus, which is known only from the type
collection made in India, is well differentiated. The Indian species is remarkable
by extremely short apothecial hairs which measure 45-135 x 10.8-12(-16.3) µm,
and by the ascospores which measure 15-16.5(-18) x 10.8-12(-13) gm, are
ornamented by larger and more spherical tubercles and possess no apiculi (there
are only enlarged tubercles on the ascospore poles). [Compare also the
illustrations and discussion in Cao & J.Moravec (1988)].#Misc-exposition*]

[@S. phymatodeus and also Scutellinia ahmadi (Cash) S. C. Kaushal in S. C.
Kaushal, R. Kaushal et Ravla (1983), of which the type (K) has also been
examined, represent species with the shortest apothecial hairs within the genus
Scutellinia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Also Scutellinia pseudotrechispora (Schrót.) Le Gal (1962) may resemble S.
totaranuiensis in having similar type of short curved hairs and apiculate
ascospores. The ascospores are, however, much larger and possess a perisporium
covered by a conspicuously reticulate ornamentation. Schumacher (1990)
accommodated S. pseudotrechispora into his series Pseudotrechisporae (Svr.) T.
Schum. of the section Minutae Svr. Notwithstanding, this species has an
outstanding position in the genus. Svréek (1948) erected even an independent
genus Melastiziella Svréek (1948) based on Humariella pseudotrechispora
Schrót., and later, the section Pseudotrechisporae Svréek (1971) of the genus
Scutellinia. The supposition of a more important position of S. pseudotrechispora
within the genus Scutellinia and that it may be more isolated than stated by
Schumacher (1990), is supported by recently published results of ultrastructure
studies of the ascospore wall made by Brummelen (1993). In my opinion,
similarly, the infrageneric position of S. totaranuiensis and S. geneospora can be
cleared by further studies on the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During my stay on New Zealand, 7 other species of the genus Scutellinia were
collected by me. Besides Scutellinia scutellata (L.: Fr.) Lamb., the following 6
species, as far as I know, have not hitherto been reported from New Zealand. All
of them were collected on the North Island, near Whakapapa Willage in the

Scutellinia torrentis (Rehm) T. Schum. However, the reexamination of the type
(K) of Lachnea torrentis Rehm revealed a much finer ornamentation of the
ascospore perisporium. The collection from New Zealand possesses the same
type of the separable perisporium which is characteristic for S. torrentis and other
species of the section Minutae Svr. Nevertheless, the ascospore ornamentation of
the New Zealand specimen is much coarser and more isolated and well agrees
with that illustrated by Gamundi (1975) of S. marginata. The exact identification
will be possible affer the reexamination of the type of S. marginata. A further
revision of all species of the section Minutae is also necessary.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two new hyphomycetes, Beltraniella amoena and B. clavatophora
anam.sp.nov., from leaf litter in Cuba are described, illustrated and discussed. In
the former, conidia are obovoid to narrowly turbinate, hyaline, without a distinctive
transverse band and with clavate separating cells; the latter has peculiar
conidiophores, which are always clavate at the apex, and conidia with a hyaline
transverse band and two pores near the distal end. A key to the species of the
genus is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

former species are also distinguished from B. amoena by their separating cells,
which are absent (in B. pirozynskii and B. clara) or of different shape, i.e:
fusiform (B. lyrata and B. peruamazonica) or ellipsoid (B. porosa). Other species

[@Lecanora argentata is a morphologically variable species. A morphotype with
raised, constricted apothecia and coarsely verrucose to granulose thallus is
often distinguished as L. subrugosa. Having examined numerous specimens of
the cosmopolitan L. argentata we are convinced that L. subrugosa represents
an extreme morphological variant of L. argentata caused by the substrate. No
anatomical differences could be observed. Poelt & Vezda (1981) have already
pointed out that morphological intermediates exist and that typical species occur
on Populus while the specimens on Acer and Fraxinus are intermediate. Similar
morphological variation caused by the substrate has been observed in the L.
dispersa group (Poelt, in litt.). In North America, Brodo (1984) found chemical
differences between populations of L. argentata and L. subrugosa. This might
indicate that the North American material of L. subrugosa belongs to a
different taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE LICHEN GENUS DIPLOSCHISTES IN SOUTH
AFRICA (THELOTREMATACEAE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@ROLAND GUDERLEY and H. THORSTEN LUMBSCH#Misc-exposition*]

[@Botanisches Institut, Universitat Essen, D-45117 Essen, Germany#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abstract: The Diploschistes taxa occurring in Southern Afri-
ca are revised. Descriptions of selected species and a key to
the 14 taxa accepted are included. D. hensseniae and D. hy-
poleucus are recorded for the first time from South Africa.
D. chloroleucus, D. compositus, D. lutescens, D. ocellatus
f. isabellinus, D. subfarinaceus and Urceolaria bispora var.
terricola are reduced to synonymy with D. cinereocaesius,
and D. almbornii with D. diploschistoides. D. austroafrica-
nus Guderley & Lumbsch is described as new.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study is a further contribution to the knowledge of the genus Diplo-
schistes and it is mainly based on a "Staatsexamensarbeit" by the first author
(Guderley 1995). The Holarctic taxa were monographed by Lumbsch (1989)
and other investigations on Diploschistes species have been reported in various
papers (Abu-zinada et al. 1986, Lumbsch 1987, 1993, Lumbsch & Aptroot
1993, Lumbsch & Elix 1985, 1989, Lumbsch & Mayrhofer 1990). A key to the
non-European species was provided by Magnusson (1956) and more recently,
Pant & Upreti (1993) revised the genus on the Indian subcontinent. The aim of
the present publication was to revise the South African representatives of the
genus and to provide a key to the taxa. A complete account of the morphology,
anatomy and chemistry is not included here, but can be found in Lumbsch
(1989). Descriptions are not given for species described in one of our publica-
tions cited above. During our studies we have found that D. bisporus differed
in excipulum structure and will be segregated as a distinct genus in a forth-
coming publication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both morphologically and chemically D. actinostomus is very similar to D.
caesioplumbeus and D. diploschistoides. Generally the latter two species have a
darker thallus than D. actinostomus, but overlaps do occur and to determine a
specimen with certainty , spore measurements are necessary. The spores in D.
caesioplumbeus and D. diploschistoides are significantly larger. D. cae-
sioplumbeus does not occur in South Africa. A further character to separate D.
diploschistoides is the strongly amyloid and halonate ascospores.#Diagnosis*]

[@Ecology and distribution: D. actinostomus occurs on exposed siliceous rocks,
usually in maritime or humid places. It has a cosmopolitan distribution. In
South Africa it is widely distributed (Fig. 2) and is the most common species of
the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution: D. aeneus occurs on exposed siliceous rocks mainly
in semiarid regions. Lumbsch (1989) originally proposed that D. aeneus had an
Asian North American disjunct distribution, but this species has since been re-
corded from Southern Europe (Lumbsch et al 1993) and now in South Africa.
The presence of D. aeneus in the Cape region was formerly recorded by
Stizenberger (1890 as Urceolaria actinostoma var. aenea) and this previously
overlooked record is now confirmed by our studies. In South Africa the species
is mainly distributed in winter rain areas of the Cape Province, but was also
collected in Namaqualand (Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

to D. diploschistoides in both the thallus colour and the spore size, but can be
distinguished by its darker, non halonate spores which do not stain intensly blue

[@Thelotrema microglaenoides and Diploschistes diploschistoides were syno-
nomised by Salisbury (1972) and this synonymy is confirmed here. D. alm-
bornii further is a synonym of D. diploschistoides. The spore size of D. alm-
bornii as reported by Dodge (1964) is erroneous (21-27 x 16-18 µm) with the
type containing much larger ascospores (39-52 x 22-26 µm). The thallus of D.
diploschistoides varies from dark to light grey, but otherwise no variation was
observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@D. hensseniae is characterized by the perithecioid ascomata, the whitish pruino-
se thallus and the presence of diploschistesic acid. Among the terricolous spe-
cies occurring in South Africa, D. hensseniae is the only species with perithe-
cioid fruiting bodies. D. thelenelloides, described from Madagascar (Lumbsch
& Aptroot 1993), is another terricolous species with perithecioid ascomata, but
differs from D. hensseniae in having bullate fertile areolae and lacking diplo-
schistesic acid.#Diagnosis*]

[@Ecology and distribution: D. hensseniae grows on soil in open situations in
semiarid regions, especially in the winter rain zone. This species exhibits simi-
lar ecology in Australia (Lumbsch & Elix 1985). Hitherto D. hensseniae was
only known from the southern part of Australia, this being the first record from
Africa. In South Africa this species is restricted to the Cape region and
Namaqualand (Fig. 9).#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT: Four species of the genus Dimelaena occurring in
the southern hemisphere are treated. Dimelaena australiensis is
reported from South Africa, South America, Western Australia and
Tasmania for the first time. D. elevata from tropical Australia is
described as new to science. The chemotype ll (usnic acid,
gyrophoric acid) of D. oreina is found in South Africa and South
America. The new combination D. fenuis is proposed for this
tropical to subtropical species, which is recorded from Venezuela,
Colombia, South Africa, Northern Territory (Australia, New
Caledonia and Papua New Guinea for the first time. D. diffractella
and D. somaliensis are synonyms of D. tenuis. Descriptions are
presented for all taxa, and their chemistry, ecology and distribution
are discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Historically the small crustaceous genus Dimelaena was included in Rinodina
(ZAHLBRUCKNER 1926) but following PoetT (1969) and HALE & CULBERSON
(1970), SHEARD (1974) treated it as a separate genus, redefining its limits to
include only those species with an unthickened spore wall and a radiate-plicate
thallus margin. The presence of apothecia which are initially cryptolecanorine
but finally become lecanorine to lecideine, and of a dark hypothecium in a
number of species suggests that Dime/aena is more closely related to Buellia
rather than to Rinodina. This view is supported by the presence of Bacidia-type
asci (RAMBOLD & al. 1994) with a conical axial body (fig. 1), and ascospores of
the Beltraminia-type (figs 2 - 5) usually lacking internal wall-thickenings and#Misc-exposition*]
[@294#Page-header*]



[@possessing a distinct torus around the septum. Both of
these characters are also found in the bulk of the
species belonging to the genus  Buellia The
spermogonia are always globose to pyriform and
immersed in the thallus, and the spermatia are
bacilliform. Five species were accepted by SHEARD
(1974), with two more added by SHEARD & MAYRHOFER
(1984). A further species was described by ALSTRUP &
al. (ALSTRUP & APTROOT 1994) but, in the present work,
this is regarded as a synonym of D. tenuis. All known
species are saxicolous and occur on siliceous rocks.

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Standard light microscopic techniques were employed for the examination of
specimens. Habit photographs were taken with a Wild M3B microscope. For the
identification of lichen substances, standardized methods for thin-layer
chromatography were used as described by CULBERSON & AMMANN (1979) and
CULBERSON & JOHNSON (1982), and for HPLC as described by FEIGE & al.
(1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Distribution: Dimelaena oreina is a widespread lichen in the holarctic. The
chemotype Il is the most widely distributed in the northern hemisphere and is
also known from mountainous areas in South Africa and from South America
(fig. 11). The specimens from Tierra del Fuego in South America (CENGIA

[@Ecology: D. oreina occurs on steeply inclined surfaces of hard siliceous rocks.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: D. oreina is characterized primarily by the presence of usnic acid,
giving the thallus a yellowish colour which was first reported by Zorr (1907). It
is further noteworthy for its chemical variation which has been reported earlier
for specimens from Greenland (LYNGE 1937), Sweden (DEGELIUS 1943), Europe
and North America (MAGNUSSON 1944), based upon simple thallus spot tests.
Later studies focused on the identification of secondary products of the six
known chemotypes (tab. 2) and on correlations of chemistry with geography
and ecology (HALE 1952, 1954, WETMORE 1968, BRODO 1968, HUNECK &

[@Distribution (figs 9 and 12): Dimelaena tenuis is apparently restricted to
subtropical and tropical regions. It was known previously from only one
collection from Australia (MULLER ARGOVIENSIS 1895, as Rinodina diffractella;
SHEARD 1974 and MAYRHOFER 1984, as Dimelaena d.), from a few localities in
Brazil (MALME 1902, as Rinodina muelleri and R. physciaeformis; SHEARD 1974
and KALB 1983, as Dimelaena diffractella), and from Somalia (ALSTRUP &
APTROOT 1994, as Dimelaena somaliensis). Here the species is reported for the
first time from Venezuela and Colombia in South America, South Africa, the
Northern Territory in Australia, New Caledonia and Papua New Guinea.
Additional records are provided from Brazil and from Queensland in Australia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology: In Australia D. fenuis occurs on more or less horizontal to slightly
inclined surfaces of massive boulders in savannahs or open dry sclerophyll
forests.#Misc-exposition*]
[@306#Page-header*]

[@Discussion: D. fenuis is especially characterized by its brown and glossy
effigurate thallus with long radiate-plicate lobes. It is well separated from D.
australiensis by its cylindrical-ellipsoid ascospores, darker thalli, different
chemistry, distribution patterns and ecology. Whereas D. australiensis is a
distinctly temperate species, only reaching the southernmost parts of
Queensland near Stanthorpe in Australia, D. fenuis is a tropical-subtropical
species with its southernmost records in southern Queensland. In contrast to D.
tenuis, D. australiensis occurs mainly on overhanging or steeply inclined rock
faces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PERONOSPORA ON ACAENA (ROSACEAE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@O. Constantinescu
Botanical Museum, Uppsala University, Villavägen 6, S-753 36 Uppsala, Sweden#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abstract. Following the examination of additional specimens, the
rare Peronospora parasitic on Acaena is described, illustrated, and
ascribed to Peronospora sparsa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Palm (1908) recorded the occurrence of Peronospora potentillae de Bary (Oomycota,
Peronosporales) on a new host, Acaena magellanica (Lam.) Vahl (= A. laevigata
(Lam.) Aiton), a rosaceous plant cultivated in the Bergius Botanic Garden,
Stockholm. Gáumann (1923), who did not examine the specimen, considered this
finding extremely interesting because of the unusual host and geographical location.
Gustavsson (1959) provided a description based on Palm's specimen deposited in
herb. S, but could not decide if this was a new species of Peronospora or not.
Brandenburger (1985) mentioned this fungus as Peronospora sp., including some
morphological details taken from Gustavsson (1959). In a revision of Peronospora
parasitic on Rosaceae in central Europe, Skalicky (1983) was ambivalent about the
taxonomy of this fungus. He stated that it should be described as a new species
(page 77), but that it is not possible to decide if it is an independent species (page
83), and eventually called it Peronospora sp. (page 84).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new specimen of Peronospora on Acaena ovalifolia Ruiz & Pavón, collected
in 1994 from Argentina, became available through the courtesy of Dr. Maria
Havrylenko de Saura. Two more specimens were found when the herbarium
material of Acaena in herb. UPS was inspected in search for Peronospora presence.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a consequence of additional material becoming available, an attempt to
elucidate the taxonomic position of Peronospora on Acaena was undertaken.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Herbaria are abbreviated according to Holmgren ef al. (1990), and for
statistical analysis the computer program InStat (GraphPad Software, 1993) was
used,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Description of the specimens#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the upper surface of attacked leaves, the tissues invaded by the fungus show
symptoms ranging from slightly discoloured areas, to numerous, reddish-brown,
vein-limited, discrete or coalesced spots.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The down is hypophyllous, often hardly visible, ochre, and consists of
conidiophores, either solitary or aggregated in patches. Conidiophores slender, more

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungi present on the four specimens of Acaena are morphologically very similar.
They show the same type of straight, slender conidiophores, and identical branching
pattern. In all samples the wall of spores has a verruculose surface, that is visible
even in DIC light (Figs 6 and 7). The means of the length and breadth, as well as the
LB ratio of the spores originating from the four specimens, were compared to each
other by applying the unpaired ¢ test, but were not significantly different.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thirteen species and one variety of Perorospora described on various Rosaceae are
listed by Constantinescu (1991). Skalicky (1983) recognized 9 taxa on this family of
plants. He divided these taxa into two groups, those parasitic on hosts belonging to
subfam. Agrimonioideae (P. agrimoniae H. Sydow, P. alchemillae Otth, and P.
sanguisorbae Gäum.), and those parasitic on hosts of subfam. Rosoideae (P. gei H.
Sydow, P. potentillae de Bary, P. fragariae Roze & Cornu, P. potentillae-reptantis
Gäum., P. rubi Rabenh. ex Schröter, and P. sparsa Berk.). In addition, he provided
two keys for the identification of these species, one for each subfamily of hosts. He
did not explain the rationale behind this partition, but it is obvious that he
considered the subfamily rank as a taxonomic boundary for both the hosts, and the
fungi. However, in the standard flora of Europe (Valentine & Chater, 1968), all
hosts involved are treated as members of subfam. Rosoideae, and the subfam.
Agrimonioideae is not recognized. Skalicky’s species concept combines an ecological
aspect (each species of Peronospora is considered as being confined to one genus of
host, or in some cases to only one or a few species), and a phenetic one (morphology
of the conidiophores and biometry of the spores).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species of Peronospora parasitic on Rosaceae can be divided into two
discrete units. First, species having ellipsoidal to obovate-ellipsoidal spores (L/B
ratio > 1-40), mostly longer than 23 µm. Here belongs only P. potentillae, parasitic on
several but not all species of Potentilla (see Skalicky (1983) and Hall (1991)).
Second, species having subglobose to broadly ellipsoidal spores (L/B ratio <1-35),
mostly shorter than 22 wm. All other Peronospora species parasitic on various genera
of Rosaceae belong here, the oldest epithet available being P. sparsa Berk. The
shape and size of spores in these species form a continuum. Some of them may
deserve specific rank, but such a decision is hindered, among other, by the paucity of
both the spores and sexual organs in most available specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Peronospora on Acaena cannot be distinguished from P. sparsa Berk., the common,
world wide parasite of cultivated roses (Francis, 1981). It has a similar, overall
morphology of the conidiophores, and the same shape and size of spores. In
addition, the ornamentation of spores, first depicted in P. sparsa by Hall (1992), is
also similar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most students of the Peronosporaceae consider P. sparsa restricted to Rosa
(Gäumann, 1923; Kochman & Majewski, 1970; Francis, 1981; Skalicky, 1983). This
narrow host specificity is not supported by experimental evidence, but is based more
on the unsubstantiated practice of considering fungi parasitic on cultivated and wild
plants as different taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of Peronospora have been discovered and described from wild
plants. When a morphologically similar fungus was found on a cultivated plant,
belonging to the same family, a new name was often introduced for the fungus
parasitic on the cultivated host. In most cases, however, the two taxa were eventually
considered conspecific. Thus, Peronospora parasitic on tobacco was described as P.
tabacina Adam (1933), and this name was in use untill Shepherd (1970) proved that
P. tabacina is only a specialized form of P. hysocyami de Bary, a species widely
spread on Solanaceae. Peronospora parasitic on sugar beet was described in 1865 as
P. schachtii Fuckel. The name was used by both mycologists and phytopathologists
untill Byford (1967) showed that this fungus is conspecific with P. farinosa (Fr. : Fr.)
Fr., the common Peronospora of many Chenopodiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Peronospora on Rosaceae is an example of a completely different situation.
The first Peronospora parasitic on Rosaceae was described on cultivated roses, in
1862, as P. sparsa Berk. Subsequently, 13 more Peronospora taxa were described,
mostly on wild Rosaceae. Although many of these taxa are indistinguishable from P.
sparsa, they were treated as distinct taxa in major publications on the
Peronosporaceae (Gáumann, 1923; Gustavsson, 1959; Kochman & Majewski, 1970;
Skalicky, 1983). Nevertheless, Constantinescu & Negrean (1983) considered that P.
sparsa is parasitic, beside Rosa, on seven other genera of Rosaceae, and Hall er al.
(1992) assigned a Peronospora found on cultivated Prunus laurocerasus L. (a
member of subfam. Prunoideae) also to P. sparsa. Moreover, recent in vitro studies
by Breese et al. (1994) demonstrated that P. sparsa and P. rubi originating from
cultivars of Rosa and Rubus are not host specific.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is little doubt that the cultivated roses are only occasional hosts of P.
sparsa, that this fungus is more common on wild Rosaceae, and that it originates
from these plants. The specimens of Acaena examined in this study have been
collected from South America and Europe where the presence of P. sparsa is
documented (Francis, 1981). Because the róle of wild hosts in the epidemiology of
diseases produced by Peronosporales was questioned (Renfro & Bhat, 1981),
confusion concerning the origin and inferred systematics of these fungi often arose.
The fact that, in some cases, the results of cross-inoculations attempts with parasitic
fungi to and from wild and cultivated hosts is negative does not mean that two fungi
are involved. The fungi living on cultivated plants have evolved and specialized on
these hosts and they may not be capable to contaminate now, related, wild plants.
Similarly, the fungi parasitic on wild hosts may not show now affinity for a related
cultivated plant. In both cases the fungi are physiologically different at the time of the
experiment. This is not necessarily evidence of different genetic origin and implicit
taxonomic dissimilarity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Abstract#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new lichen species, Miriquidica mexicana, is described from Baja Cali-
fornia. Conspicuous features are its glossy, brown, areolate thallus and its
black prothallus composed of dendroid-branched strands. It is the first
known desert-inhabiting species of this predominantly boreal-montane genus
and grows on sites exposed to frequent fog from the Pacific ocean.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Miriquidica (Lecanoraceae) is mostly found in boreal-montane
and arctic-alpine habitats of Europe (HERTEL & RAMBOLD 1987, RAMBOLD
& SCHWAB 1989) and North America (EGAN 1989, THOMSON & WEBER
1992). Here the southern limit is reached by, e.g., M. deusta, which is fairly
common in the siliceous mountains of the western Mediterranean area and
Macronesia (NIMIS 1993). This species and M. leucophaea are the only
representatives of the genus hitherto recorded from the Southern Hemisphe-
re, from the alpine zone of Australia (RAMBOLD 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The discovery of a species of Miriquidica in a subtropical desert therefore
is surprising, and suggests a considerable enlargement of the known spec-#Misc-exposition*]
[@320#Page-header*]

[@trum of ecological conditions in which the genus is found. However, its
occurrence in the desert along the Pacific coast in Baja California most
probably depends on the cold stream, which influences the coast strongly
and causes a cooler climate with frequent fog. This situation may offer
growth conditions much more similar to those in boreal-montane environ-
ments than usual in deserts. Indeed, the sites in which it is found show a
much more luxuriant lichen flora than usual in deserts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution: Miriquidica mexicana is most likely an endemic
species of Baja California. It has been found on stones on the soil in scarce
desert scrub on exposed sites at low elevations on the Pacific side of the
Baja California Peninsula (Fig. 2). Phytogeographically the collecting
localities belong to the northern and southern Vizcaíno Regions of the
Sonoran desert. On one label basalt is mentioned as substrate; another
collection has grown in part on a quartz band.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes. Superficially M. mexicana resembles members of the Lecidea atro-
brunnea group and is characterized by a brown thallus, a hypothallus com-
posed of dendroid-branched strands, sessile apothecia which contain algal
cells in their margins, relatively small ascospores, a hyaline hypothecium
and the content of miriquidic acid or lobaric acid. The alternative occurren-
ce of these two substances within one and the same species is already
known from Miriquidica deusta, a similar species which differs by adnate
apothecia and much broader ascospores. In habit, M. mexicana resembles
most M. garovaglii, from which it differs by the absence of stictic acid and
by the smaller ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The color of the epithecial pigment varies from olive-green to almost blue--
green. It reacts HCl+ blue, HNOgsoq,+ pink. In their earliest stages the
apothecia are aspicilioid and immersed in the thallus areoles. The surroun-
ding thallus develops a whitish-pruinose, raised rim, which soon develops
into a black proper margin. This development forms a transition between
lecideine or biatorine and lecanorine margination, a situation not known
before in Miriquidica. Similar transitions are common in various genera of
crustose lichens, e.g., Schaereria.#Description*]

[@Another extension of the genus concept of Miriquidica is formed by the
recent inclusion of M. ventosa from southern Finland and East Siberia
(TIMDAL 1993). This is the only taxon in the otherwise crustose genus with
a squamulose to subfoliose thallus and "Rhizinenstränge" as holdfasts. These
structures may be homologous with the dendroid strands of the hypothallus
of M. mexicana, which are, however, narrowly attached to the substrate. A
parallel situation is found in the Icmadophilaceae, in which Knightiella
splachnirima is the only squamulose to subfoliose taxon within a group of
otherwise exclusively crustose taxa (RAMBOLD et al. 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1984, a heavily rusted collection of Acacia pennata (L.) Willd. ssp. kerrii 1. Nielsen
from Cape York Peninsula was brought to the attention of the senior author. Acacia
pennata ssp. kerrii is a prickly liana with bipinnate leaves, up to 20 pinnae per leaf and
25-30 pairs of leaflets on each pinna (Ross, 1991). In Australia it is known only from
the tip of Cape York Peninsula, but it occurs in South East Asia from North Eastern
India, through Burma, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia to the Indonesian Archipelago
(Nielsen, 1985; Ross, 1991). On the collection discussed here, two rusts were seen on
the leaflets, both present only as teliospores. The predominant rust is a species of
Sphaerophragmium, described below. The other, with only a few telia present, is a
species of Ravenelia but insufficient material is available to allow specific identification
(pers. obs.; Prof. G.B. Cummins, pers. comm., 1984) The new species of
Sphaerophragmium described here is only the second reported from the genus Acacia
and adds another to the sixteen species accepted in the recent monograph of the genus
(Lohsomboon, Kakishima and Ono, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sphaerophragmium quadricellulare differs in several respects from S. silveirae Speg.,
the only other species reported from Acacia and known only from the type collection on
Acacia pedicellata Benth. in Brazil (Monoson, 1974; Lohsomboon, Kakishima and
Ono, 1994). Sphaerophragmium silveirae was described with 3-9 celled teliospores (8-
celled according to Monoson (1974) who re-examined the type specimen) and
teliospore appendages only up to 2.5m long, with 2-3 short apical branches. The
teliospores were also larger (25-35 x 33-48 µm, fide Monoson, 1974) than those of
S. quadricellulare. Apart from S. quadricellulare, eight other species of
Sphaerophragmium with four-celled teliospores are known. Two of these, S. parkiae
Dennis and S. a/biziae Lohsomboon, Kakishima & Ono, occur on hosts in the family
Mimosaceae. However, S. parkiae has teliospore appendages only l-5 µm long and
sometimes branched near the tip, and the appendages of S. a/biziae are of a similar
length but unbranched and with an obtuse tip. These two species also have associated
uredinia. Three other species, S. evernium H. Sydow (on Dialium, Caesalpiniaceae),
S. irregulare Arthur & Cummins (on Strongylodon, Fabaceae) and S. mucunae
Raciborski (on Mucuna, Fabaceae), also occur on legumes. Like S. quadricellulare, S.
evernium is known only in the telial stage but it differs in having somewhat larger, less
flattened teliospores with shorter appendages than S. quadricellulare. The other two#Misc-exposition*]

[@species have uredinia associated with the telia and their teliospores are larger with
shorter appendages than found in S. quadricellulare. Of the remaining three species, S.
artabotrydis Doidge and S. boanense Cummins occur on hosts in the unrelated family
Annonaceae, and differ in teliospore size and ornamentation; and S. debile Sydow &
H. Sydow is no longer considered a species of Sphaerophragmium as its teliospores are
subtended by colourless cysts, and it has recently been transferred to the genus
Spumula as Spumula debilis (Sydow & H. Sydow) Lohsomboon, Kakishima & Ono
(1994, as ‘debile’).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sphaerophragmium quadricellulare is the second species of the genus found in
Australia but the first on an indigenous host. The other species, S. acaciae (Cooke)
Magnus, has been found in both its uredinial and telial stages on the introduced A/bizia
lebbeck (L.) Benth. and A. falcataria (L.) Fosb., and on A. procera (Roxb.) Benth.
(Mimosaceae) in Queensland (Simmonds, 1966; see specimens examined below) and as
uredinia in two collections on A. /ebbeck from the Northern Territory. It probably is
present also in the north of Western Australia, as several teliospores characteristic of
S. acaciae were found loose on the surface of leaves of the grass Cenchrus elymoides
F. Muell., infected with Puccinia levis (Sacc. & Bizz.) Magnus var. levis, collected on
an island in Prince Frederick Harbour, at the mouth of the Hunter River, north-west
Kimberley district. Sphaerophragmium — acaciae is quite — distinct from
S. quadricellulare in having larger (6-) 8 celled teliospores, with shorter wall
appendages (usually less than 10 µm long) and somewhat stouter (longer and wider)
teliospore pedicels which, like those of S. quadricellulare, are finely roughened on their
lower third.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Sphaerophragmium was not included amongst the nine genera and 161
species of rusts accepted in Australia at that time by McAlpine (1910). Its earliest
records date from the 1963 collections in Queensland of S. acaciae by Dr R.F.
Langdon (see collections listed below) and reported by Simmonds (1966). Although
there are differing opinions concerning the definition and extent of the family,
Sphaerophragmium is accepted here as a member of the family Raveneliaceae Leppik
(1972), as circumscribed by Savile (1989). Of the 38-40 rust genera and over 400
species currently known (Feb. 1995) in Australia (J. Walker, unpublished Australian
rust census data) seven genera belong in this family. In addition to
Sphaerophragmium, these include — Atelocauda (with two species, formerly as
Uromyces) and Uromycladium (eight species), all on Acacia hosts; Ravenelia (four or
five species) on Acacia (Mimosaceae) and Cassia (Caesalpiniaceae); Kernkampella
(two species) on Breynia and Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae); Nyssopsora (one species)
on Citriobatus (Pittosporaceae), and Tranzschelia (one species) on Prunus (Rosaceae,
uredinia and telia) and Anemone (Ranunculaceae, pycnia and aecia). With the
exception of Sphaerophragmium acaciae on the introduced Albizia lebbeck and
A. falcataria and Tranzschelia discolor (Fuckel) Tranz. & Litv. on introduced Prunus
and Anemone, all these rusts appear to be native and occur on native hosts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Australia, the host of S. quadricellulare, Acacia pennata ssp. kerrii, is known only
from the northernmost part of Cape York Peninsula, at what appears to be the southern#Misc-exposition*]

[@limit of its South East Asian distribution. A search for S. quadricellulare in other
countries where the host occurs could well extend the known limited distribution of this
rust. At least one other rust is known on A. pennata ssp. kerrii, from Indonesia on the
island of Java, and this will be considered elsewhere with several other Acacia rusts
(J. Walker, unpublished).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a result of its peculiar geographical position as well as by reason of its specific
climatic and orographic features, Italy is home to many species of Gasteromycetes, both
apogees and hypogeous#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since the 1909 contribution by Petri in Flora Italica Cryptogama, which dealt only
with a few groups of Italian Gasteromycetes, no other comprehensive revision of these
singular fungi has been started on a national scale. Accordingly, from the beginning of
the century to date, the contributions to a better knowledge of Italian Gasteromycetes
have been occasional and sporadic and on the whole, in sharp contrast to what has been
accomplished for the other taxonomic groups such as the Agaricales, Boletales,
Russulales, etc., not been conducive to any in-depth understanding of these fungi in our
country#Misc-exposition*]

[@Personally, since my first paper (Quadraccia, 1977) on Gyrophragmium duunalii
(Fr.) Zeller, I have been interested in the study of Gasteromycetes, especially those
growing in Central Italy. In fact, since then I have reported on a number of interesting
taxa. These include Psendocolus fusiformis (Fisch.) Lloyd (Quadraccia, 1983),
previously of uncertain presence in Italy, Gastrocybe lateritia Watling (Watling et al.,#Misc-exposition*]
[@332#Page-header*]

[@1986), first record in Europe, and Colus hirndinosus Cay. et Sech. (Quadraccia &
Ubrizsy-Savoia, 1987), first record in Latium. I also provided data on /u/ostoma
cyclophorum Lloyd in Italy (Demoulin, 1984) as well as the descriptions of Geastrum
morganit Lloyd, Nidulartopsis iowensis (Walk.) Zeller and Lycoperdon lividum Pers., all
new to the mycoflora of Italy (Quadraccia & Lunghini, 1990), and an Arachnion sp.
which in the present paper is proposed as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present work is meant to be the first of a standing series on Italian
GASTEROMYCETES, with a view to supporting the implementation of an exhaustive
revision of the extant flora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic features were described using free-hand sections of basidiocarps from
fresh and dried material, mounted in HO, in 3% KOH or in Melzer's reagent, and
squashed. All microscopic measurement were made from structures mounted in
lactophenol or in lactophenol-cotton blue. Small portions of dried tissue were revived by
wetting with 95% ethanol and soaking in water before sectioning Spore dimension
ranges are based on the measurement, under oil-immersion objective (x 1000), of 20-30
random mature spores, selected for each collection. Spores measurements are recorded
excluding the ornamentation. Colour terms in parentheses are those of Kornerup &
Wanscher (1978), designed as plate, column and row, other color names are not
standardized#Misc-exposition*]

[@Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs were obtained with a
Stereoscan 200 Cambridge. Spores were mounted with RX-glue on a aluminum stub or
in a drop of 50% ethanol and dispersed, under a stereo-microscope, with a fine needle on
aluminum stub, and later dried in the air The stubs were coated with a layer of gold-
palladium of 500 A for 120 sec., under vacuum in an atmosphere of Argon, at 1.4 KV
and 18 mA, and processed in a standard sputter. Observations were made at either 15 or
25 KV, according to the conditions of the sample#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the fourteen species included in Arachnion Schw. (=Scoleciocarpus Berk),
A. iulii is most closely related to 4. album Schw , an American species, and the type of
the genus. Arachnion drummondii Berk, from Australia, and A. fener (Berk.) Long,
from South Africa, are similar and also lack both the endoperidium and capillitium and
have elliptic, long-pedicelled spores These are characters shared by A. album which
differs from A. iulii in having ovoid, smaller and unpedicelled spores. The spores of 4.
drummondii are also subglobose, smaller (4 8-5.0 µm) and unpedicellate Arachnion
tener has pedicellate spore like those of A. /ziii but is clearly different because they are
subglobose and very small, 3.7-4 0 µm. Two other species which differ from A. iulii by
having a well developed endoperidium and typical capillitial hyphae with septa are 4.
lazoi Demoulin and A. //oydianum Demoulin (Demoulin, 1972). Arachnion lazoi has
globose spores with a short pedicel (1.5 µm) when present and capillitial branches with
frequent septa which appear like the spines in Mycenasırum Desv. — Arachnion
lloydianum has capillitial branches with very sparse septa, frequent pores but the
branching is also similar to the spines of Mycenastrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the field A. iwlii is macroscopically similar to a species of Bovista Pers‘ Pers. but
the distinctive sand grain-like glebal chambers are unmistakably diagnostic The
propagules or diaspores in Arachnion are wind dispersed like sand grains and lack both
capillitium and endoperidium. Since A. iu/ii possess both of these characteristics it is to
be regarded as a primitive genus which has evolved close to the Sclerodermatales I

[@Arachnion is included in the Lycoperdales, in the family Arachniaceae, erected by
Coker and Couch (1928) listing A. a/bum as the only species. In light of the present

in the gleba with glebal chambers which when ripe, or mature, split up like sand grains
This character, however, is also present in Morganella Zeller (Kreisel & Dring, 1967)
which underscores the separation of the genus Arachnion from the Lycoperdaceae as a
very specialized ancestral group.#Misc-exposition*]

tuberculate and subreticulate ornamentation are diagnostic. In the field the new taxon
bore some resemblance to a member of the Lyycoperdaceae, but a deeper analysis of both

[@Of all the Radiigera species so far described, only R. fuscogleba could bear a vague
resemblance to &. romana both in the overall aspect and peridial morphology. At any
rate, it can be separated immediately, but not exclusively by the smaller (viz. 4-5.5 µm)
and much less ornamented (warts 0.5-1 µm) spores. Aadiigera romana has been easily
isolated in axenic culture on "Potato Carrot Dextrose Agar" (PCDA)#Diagnosis*]

[@Zeller (1944) erected the family Mesophelliaceae (Cunn.) Zeller to accomodate the
genera Mesophellia Berk. and Castoreum Cooke et Massee with elliptic spores and the
genera Abstoma Cunn. and Radiigera with globose spores. Later, the genus
Mesophelliopsis Batista & Vital, a monotypic genus typified by M4. pernambucensis, was
first described from Brazil but present in Mexico as well (Batista & Vital, 1957,
Guzman, 1971). It was also included in the family Mesophelliaceae. Recently on the
basis of the detailed comparative work by Askew & Miller (1977), it is undisputable that
Radiigera is closer to Geastrum than to Mesophellia and Castoreum, the sole two
genera at present included in the family Mesophelliaceae. Both Radiigera and Geastrum
show the same radial arrangement of the gleba, and identical structures of peridium and
pseudocolumella, moreover they have similar capillitium, basidia and spores. Hence the
inclusion of Radiigera in the family Gaestraceae seems more rational. Similarly Abstoma
is included in the family Lycoperdaceae (Bronchart & Demoulin, 1973), while
Mesophelliopsis, still a little known genus of uncertain taxonomic position.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some mature conidia can proliferate at the apex and produce new conidia. We
describe this phenomenon as a false branching; a new conidiogenous locus is produced
from the conidial apex, when the conidium, instead of seceding, remains in contact with
the conidiogenous cell. This can be possibly ascribed to a high level of moisture
occurring during the fructification (Gams, pers. comm ).#Description*]

[@Pseudospiropes dumeti agrees with the generic concept of Pseudospiropes M B
Ellis (Ellis, 1971; Iturriaga & Korf, 1990) on the basis of all the characteristics examined
Furthermore, Pseudospiropes dumeti differs from the related genus Spiropes Ciferri
because of its strictly saprophytic habit, and indeed it has never been found in
association with other fungi Notwithstanding the similarity in the form of conidia, we
would not include this species in either Pyriculariopsis M B Ellis, or Pyricularia Sacc ,

rhexolytically (de Hoog & Van Oorschot, 1985)#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Curtis Gates Lloyd (1859-1926) was an important and
somewhat unconventional American mycologist. We have
studied C.G. Lloyd's publications and research notes curated
in the Lloyd Library, Cincinnati, Ohio. Only brief exposés
of his life have been found, and the purpose of this study is
to appraise his potential impact on modern systematic
views. Lloyd's contributions to mycology, including his
seven volumes of Mycological Writings, his "mycological
wit," and a 59,000 specimen fungal herbarium, are
substantial. His collection of photographs of mycologists as
well as his photographic representation of fleshy fungi are
exceptional. However, Lloyd's strong opinions on
nomenclature, against citing the author of fungal names, and
against the generally obligatory principle of nomenclatural
priority, have not found their way into the International
Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Despite his lobby against
the proliferation of new species names, Lloyd published
over a thousand new names of fungi. His descriptions of
many kinds of macroscopic fungi, especially
Gasteromycetes, are widely cited, indicating his continued
impact on mycology. Lloyd successfully promoted
American mycological literature internationally through his
voluminous mycological correspondence. His legacy
persists in numerous components of the unique Lloyd
Library, and in several natural areas donated to science.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NARRATIVE#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rogers (1981) made reference to a biographer of the
renowned mycologist, Curtis Gates Lloyd (1859-1926).
However, only short articles (Fitzpatrick, 1927; Simons,
1951) or brief parts of publications (Mayo, 1928; Simons,
1972; Rogers, 1981; Tyler and Tyler, 1987; Campbell, 1991;
Korf, 1991) could be found on Lloyd. These publications are
largely anecdotal, in some cases sparsely referenced and, with
the partial exception of Fitzpatrick (1927), contain but limited
analysis of Lloyd's actual work in and contributions to
mycology. The present paper focuses upon Lloyd's
mycological studies, viewpoints, and items of interest
centering around these, with no special attempt to review
information about his life which has previously been
published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@C.G. Lloyd's contributions to mycology, including his
seven volumes of Mycological Writings (the flagrant
pagination irregularities withstanding), his unprecedented
correspondence with other mycologists of the world, and his
famous "mycological wit" (e.g., Fig.1), are substantial indeed.
However, some points of "credit" deserve further scrutiny.
Simons (1951) believed that "many of his ideas [on
nomenclature] have been adopted by the International
Botanical Congress." On the contrary, Lloyd's strong
opinions on botanical nomenclature, i.e., against citing the
author(s) of plant (and fungal) names (a practice which he
considered "personal advertisement"), and also against the
legislated protocol of name priority (cf. Lloyd, 1902a), have
not stood the test of time. Lloyd believed that botanical
nomenclature was much like a language and that its usage
should evolve naturally as such, without "artificial" rules and
regulations. He felt that adherence to the principle of
nomenclatural priority could result in the overturning of
well-known names, in favor of poorly known earlier names, a
practice he unflatteringly labelled "name juggling"(Lloyd,
1904a). Lloyd (19102) believed that the designation of "type#Misc-exposition*]
[@355#Page-header*]

[@species" in a genus potentially led to "name juggling."
However, he (1904b) viewed the type specimen of a species as
it is properly viewed today, simply as an "authentic and true
specimen of the species." Lloyd (1910b) was essentially in
accord with Farlow and Atkinson's proposal for later starting
point dates for fungal nomenclature (Pfister, 1981), this
proposal being adopted at the Brussels Botanical Congress in
1910.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite his long-term lobby against the proliferation of
new species by taxonomists (e.g., Lloyd, 1907a), and against
affixing of the names of the authors to species names, Lloyd
published over a thousand new species names of fungi.
Although representing careful scholarship, authorship was
usually not indicated, and it became necessary for other
workers to laboriously ferret out such names from his
literature (Stevenson and Cash, 1936). Lloyd's publication of
some of these taxa under the pen name, "N.J. McGinty,"
further complicated the situation. Some of these "McGinty
names" are probably to be taken seriously (Lloyd, 1922a),
and others probably not (Lloyd, 1910c, 1913a). Since it was
not always possible to decide with certainty, the McGinty
names are usually included in lists of species attributed to
Lloyd (cf. Stevenson and Cash, 1936). McGinty names or
combinations have occasionally surfaced, nomenclaturally
legitimized, e.g. the name for conidial peat mould,
Chromelosporium fulvum (Link) McGinty, Hennebert &
Korf in Hennebert and Korf (1975). McGintya, a journal
emphasizing "unusual and mysterious discoveries in mycology
and related fields," began with its first issue in August, 1994,
dedicated to "Professor N.J. McGinty."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lloyd was free with his criticism of the work of other
mycologists and, when he believed it warranted, stated his
opinions candidly, regardless of the circumstances. As a case
in point the reader is referred to Lloyd's less than guarded
comments concerning the superficiality of the Australian
work of the British mycologist, Dr. Mordecai C. Cooke, these#Misc-exposition*]
[@356#Page-header*]

[@remarks being composed shortly after Dr. Cooke's death
(Lloyd, 1915a). Lloyd's opinions varied greatly about certain
mycologists over time, turning rapidly in some cases from
praise to ridicule (see Korf, 1991, concerning Lloyd's
remarks on Elias Durand). In his latter work, Lloyd
occasionally employed the sardonic visage (see interpretation
of Fitzpatrick, 1927) of the little Oriental God, Tso Kay, as
an inset imprint into brief articles (see Lloyd, 1924a) in
which he attacked "hypocrisy" in mycological work. This
"hypocrisy" usually involved matters of priority and "name
juggling." E. A. Burt, a worker in resupinate
Thelephoraceae, and a strict prioritist, became a favorite
target for the Tso Kay image (Lloyd, 1924b). Lloyd (1924c)
even inferred the possibility of an influence of Tso Kay's
"sayings" on a perceived improvement in Burt's work.
Although Lloyd could be unmercifully critical of others, it is
only fair to say that Lloyd was equally critical of his own
work throughout his career, as exemplified by the title of his
Mycological Note no. 185, "An Inexcusable Blunder." In this
brief article (1902b), he chides himself harshly for writing
down an incorrect species name in his "Genera of
Gastromycetes," published the same year. Regarding caustic
commentary, Lloyd, who had a flair for composing titles of
articles, was the author of a number of amusing and
sometimes acrid short publications, such as "Logic of a Name
Juggler" (1905a), "A Possible Mistake in Japan" (1908a),
"What a Long Tail Our Cat Does Have!" (1910d), "Another
'fungus' Gone Wrong" (1911a), and "Speaking of Bulls!"
(1923), in which he criticized the work or ideas of one person
or another, including himself. Lloyd's intolerant side showed
in his opinion of student theses (Lloyd, 1921a), which he
considered (typically, anyway) as "the pests of the librarian"
and "a waste of time and printer's ink."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Regardless of outspoken remarks, C.G. Lloyd's
original descriptive contributions on macroscopic fungi are
significant. Curtis' initial work (e.g., J.U. & C.G. Lloyd,1885
-86) was with with his brother (famous pharmacognocist John#Misc-exposition*]
[@357#Page-header*]

[@Uri Lloyd) on medicinal angiosperms (an effort related to the
family business). However, in the early 1890s Curtis turned
his scientific attention almost exclusively to fungi. C.G.
Lloyd's publications on fungi began in the late 1890s, dealing
at first with agarics such as the "Volvae" (1898a), Lepiota
(1898b), Psalliota (1899), and Collybia (1900). Lloyd
(1898a) pointedly stated that "there are hundreds of botanists
in the United States going over the same old ground year
after year, flowering plants, when a practically unexplored
field [fungi] lies at their very doors" and that "the study of the
larger fungi, especially Agarics, is suffering for want of
careful workers..." Lloyd received early recognition for his
work, as attested by the brief but favorably phrased review
article by Bessey (1898) discussing Lloyd's contribution to
knowledge of the Volvae (Amanita and Volvaria).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rather swiftly though, Lloyd switched his primary
interest from agarics to Gasteromycetes, beginning with his
published plea (1901a) to "Save Your Puffballs." This was
followed by detailed descriptive works on puffballs and
earthstars (e.g., Lloyd, 1902c, 1902d, 1903, 1905b, 1907b)
and also bird's-nest fungi (Lloyd, 1906a). Subsequently,
Lloyd (1908b) issued the call to "Observe Your Phalloids,"
including instructions to readers on sketching, photography
(if possible), drying, and mailing of phalloid specimens. This
was followed by Lloyd's (1909) extensive publication on
phalloids; the illustrations in this publication (some are
drawings and some are photographs) are well worth a careful
look by any investigator of phalloid systematics; the source of
a number of the illustrations is, however, unclear. Coker and
Couch (1928) accorded Lloyd ample credit for the substance
of his contribution to knowledge of Gasteromycetes. If one
were to select one major group of fungi to associate with the
efforts of C.G. Lloyd, it would surely be the Gasteromycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although not losing his interests in the Gasteromycetes,
Lloyd again shifted emphasis to an extent, this time to
polypores (e.g., Lloyd 1910e, 1911b, 1912, 1915b) and also#Misc-exposition*]
[@358#Page-header*]

[@thelephoraceous fungi (e.g., Lloyd, 1913b). However, during
the latter part of his active career, Lloyd devoted his attention
primarily to some of the larger Pyrenomycetes (Lloyd,
1917a), especially Cordyceps (e.g., Lloyd, 1915c, 1920) and
Xylaria (e.g., Lloyd, 1918, 1924d, 1924e), and also to
certain Discomycetes (e.g., Lloyd, 1916a). Hence, Lloyd's
work shows, though not in an all-or-none fashion, something
of a transition from work on fleshy Basidiomycetes (first
agarics, then Gasteromycetes and polypores) to the study of
fleshy or indurated Ascomycetes. That this transition was at
least somewhat formulated in Lloyd's mind seems clear from
his statement to his readers (1917b) regarding the kinds of
specimens which he wished to receive: "All are desired
excepting specimens of fleshy Agarics.". Hence, by 1917,
Lloyd planned no further work on mushrooms per se.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In his mycological taxonomic work, Lloyd (1904c)
believed in use, but not overuse, of what is seen through the
microscope in determining taxonomic boundaries and
relationships. Lloyd felt that, for example, basidial
characters were difficult to utilize as primary characters in
many Gasteromycetes since such features were visible only in
the young stages of the fungus. In this regard, Lloyd was
opposed to the scheme of classification proposed (by Fischer)
in Engler and Prantl (cf. Lloyd, 1902c). Nonetheless,
Lloyd's work, as exemplified by his (1902c) work on
Gasteromycetes, occasionally contained some illustration
(photomicrograph or drawing) of spores of the organisms as
viewed through a microscope. In fact, Lloyd (1902e)
provided a clear statement of his uniform method of
photomicrography of spores of Gasteromycetes, so that spore
dimensions could be readily ascertained by his readership.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Regardless of views on the value of microscopic detail,
Lloyd's taxonomic work was underpined by years of study of
type material in major European herbaria. His massive and
admirable treatment of phalloids (Lloyd, 1909) was
accompanied by a list of species in major museums such as#Misc-exposition*]
[@359#Page-header*]

[@Kew, the British Museum, Paris, Upsala, and Berlin. Lloyd
communicated notes of some of his travels to his readership
(e.g., Lloyd, 1904d). Lloyd's work was bolstered not only by
his extensive visits to Europe, but also by travel to tropical
regions such as Samoa (Fig. 2); Lloyd visited Samoa on at
least two occasions (see Lloyd, 1909, pg. 74). Lloyd
published one brief article on "fungi" of Samoa (1911c), an
account of the Myxomycetes he collected there (these being
determined by "Professor Macbride"). Lloyd was not
especially fond of Myxomycetes, and in another brief
publication (1921b) stated that, reluctantly, "I have had to
study them a little." An occasional brief allusion to Samoan
fungi is to be found in other Lloyd publications (e.g., Lloyd
1909, pgs. 18, 74). However, Lloyd was enriched by his
Samoan experience far beyond what might be indicated by his
publications. An unpublished photo album of his 10-week stay
in Samoa (Winter of 1899-1900) resides in the Lloyd
Library, Cincinnati, and provides a fascinating record of this
trip, in which he was influenced not only by the plants and
fungi, but by the people. In addition to his own travels,
Lloyd's voluminous correspondence brought specimens from
around the world to his attention, and hence his (Lloyd,
19072) global view of the fungal flora, and stated opposition
to the creation of new species, which might actually be fungi
already known in another country (see also Lloyd, 1906b). As
we can determine, Lloyd provided some of the foundation#Misc-exposition*]

[@of modern mycogeographic thought, taking into careful
account similarities and differences of particular kinds of
fungi from different parts of the world (e.g., Lloyd, 1916b),
and as well the host materials on which they occurred.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Perhaps underestimated contributions of C.G. Lloyd's
are his many exceptional macroscopic photographs (or to use
his term "photogravure") of a great variety of fleshy fungi.
In the years between turning his attention fully to the study of
fungi, early 1890s, and the time he assumed the competence
to publish upon them, late 1890s, he took hundreds of
photographs of fresh or well preserved material (see
"Introduction," 1898c), a practice which he continued
virtually to the end of his life. Although Lloyd considered
his photography to represent no special skill (or as he put it,
to be "largely mechanical"), most of his photomicrographs of
fleshy fungi are of high quality and are to be found
throughout his mycological writings. A bound set of 32
photographs, the so-called "Photogravure of American
Fungi" per se, was apparently not formally published as a
unit, but is available for examination at the Lloyd Library
(Fig. 3) in Cincinnati (We note that Simons, 1951, considered
this set to be "published," and, indeed, publication is a matter
of definition). Many mycological photographs (e.g., Fig. 4),
published and unpublished, are available at the Lloyd
Library, some taken by C.G. Lloyd and others provided to
him by collectors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Seemingly even less appreciated are a substantial
number of photographs and/or photographic reproductions of
faithful portraits of C.G. Lloyd's mycological colleagues of
various countries, and also of some of their predecessors. As
was the case with specimens, some photos were taken by
Lloyd, while others were sent to him for reproduction.
Although Lloyd was generally complimentary of the
individuals, their inclusion in his works fortunately was not
necessarily determined by what he thought personally of them
or their work. These reproductions appear to begin with the#Misc-exposition*]
[@363#Page-header*]

[@inclusion of a portrait of the Rev. G. Bresadola in the front
part of Volume 2 of Mycological Writings, a man with whom
Lloyd carried on an extensive mycological correspondence.
Other photographic reproductions include those of P.A.
Saccardo (author of Sylloge Fungorum), A.P. Morgan (who
introduced Lloyd to the study of mycology), Charles H. Peck
(whom Lloyd considered "the father of systematic American
mycology"), L.R. Tulasne (an earlier monographer of the
Nidulariaceae), Professor George Massee (a curator of
cryptogams at Kew), W.A. Kellerman (whom Lloyd felt had
"succeeded in instilling new life into American mycology"),
Emile Boudier ("the acknowledged master of French
mycology"), Lars Romell (who had "the best knowledge of
Swedish fungi"), W.G. Farlow ("Professor of Crytogamic
Botany at Harvard University," and originator of the
"Bibliographical Index of American Fungi"), H.C. Beardslee
(a man with "a critical knowledge of the Agarics"), the Rev.
M.J. Berkeley (clergyman and pioneer Engish mycologist),
Professor Roland Thaxter (Chair of Cryptogamic Botany,
Harvard), Professor George F. Atkinson of Cornell (Lloyd
was complimentary of Atkinson's introductory book on
American mushrooms), and Elsie M. Wakefield ("the head of
the mycological department at Kew Gardens," an expert on
Thelephoraceae, and the only woman featured in Lloyd's
series of portraits). Collectively, these and other likenesses
provided by Lloyd stand today as a unique treasure-house of
rare portraits of many of the founders of mycological
science. As is evident, Lloyd added to the interest of these
portraits by providing commentary in association with each,
either as a figure legend or in a brief article.#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. G. Lloyd's personal fungal herbarium, estimated at
59,000 specimens (cf. Simons, 1972), is housed presently at
the USDA in Beltsville, MD, after first being sent to the
Smithsonian Institution. This large collection is unusual as an
individual, yet world-wide, compilation. Lloyd's fungal
herbarium is maintained today as a separate collection
at the USDA (Mary Palm and Amy Rossman, personal#Misc-exposition*]
[@364#Page-header*]

[@communication), and is available, apparently in its entirety,
for perusal. However, some difficulty attends its study, since
exsiccatae (lists of preserved specimens), common in many
systematic collections, are generally absent from the Lloyd
collection (Fitzpatrick, 1927). Lloyd (1914) considered
exsiccatae to be often of relatively little value because so
many specimens were "misnamed." Lloyd, in fact, did not
personally collect the vast majority of these fungi; rather,
they were sent to him by collectors and correspondents from
around the world. Acknowledgement of receipt of these
specimens from other collectors was frequently published in
various of Lloyd's "Mycological Notes" (e.g., Lloyd, 1901b).
Although better known for his mycological collection, C.G.
Lloyd also amassed a phanerogamic plant collection of almost
30,000 specimens. This phanerogamic collection was
obtained primarily by herbarium exchange, but also through
Lloyd's own collecting efforts as a young man; it is housed at
the University of Cincinnati, where it is on "long-term,
interlibrary loan" (Simons, 1972).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lloyd showed a keen appreciation of the history of
mycology, and his place in it. His sensitivity to this history
seems contradictory given his frequent refusal to cite authors
or even references. The dearth of citation makes it difficult
for the reader to trace the origin and historical context of
various scientific names Lloyd employed in his works.
Nonetheless, Lloyd's appreciation of his predecessors, and
contemporaries, as regards his entrance into the field of
mycology, is evident virtually from the outset of his
mycological writings. These sentiments are clearly stated in
his "Explanation" (1905c) placed at the beginning of
Mycological Writings, Vol. 1, in which homage is paid to
such prior workers as A.P. Morgan, G. Bresadola, and
Professor Patouillard for their assistance to Lloyd in his
becoming a mycologist. In one of his earliest unified works
on Gasteromycetes, Lloyd (1902c) devoted a page to the topic
of history of work on the group; in this, he makes certain
to credit the efforts of previous workers such as "Peck,#Misc-exposition*]
[@365#Page-header*]

[@Trelease, and Morgan." In the same vein, Lloyd (1906a)
accorded Tulasne credit for laying the foundation of work in
the Nidulariaceae. Lloyd (1909) gave Edward Fischer
deference, including an excellent portrait photograph, for his
knowledge of phalloids; and, in a similar manner, celebrated
W.A. Murrill (Lloyd, 1915d) for coming "into prominence
through his publication on the Polyporus." Lloyd's
publications occasionally featured brief articles by other
mycologists, e.g., Bourdot (1916), and earlier, Bresadola and
Patouillard (1901) who named a thelephoraceous fungal genus
after Lloyd, viz., "Lloydella Bres."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lloyd (1898a) was acutely aware from the outset of the
lack of a usable, accurate, and up-to-date literature of
American mycology. Lloyd (1905d), in "advertising pages,"
continued to be cognizant and outspoken on how much
nomenclature and other taxonomic matters had been
"bungled," especially in American mycological work. Lloyd
(1917c), who had taught himself a considerable measure of
language facility while in other countries, wrote eloquently in
a text passing between English and French (and in one
passage, German), in his historically impressive "Myths of
Mycology," on the rather primitive and undistinguished state
of American mycology up to that point. It was through his
many Mycological Notes and Letters mailed to
correspondents over the years, essentially free of charge, that
Lloyd would seem to have achieved his early implied
objective (1898a) of promoting and _ upgrading,
internationally, American mycological literature. Lloyd's
mycological correspondence is curated at the Lloyd Library
and Museum in Cincinnati, alphabetically arranged (personal
communication, M.A. Flannery). A future biographer of
C.G. Lloyd will be well served by this material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recent citations of Lloyd's work (e.g., Gilbertson and
Ryvarden, 1986-87; Ryvarden, 1989), though not always
totally complimentary (Ryvarden, 1989), indicate nonetheless
Lloyd's continued impact on mycology. A certain exception#Misc-exposition*]
[@366#Page-header*]

[@should be taken with Ryvarden's description of C.G. Lloyd as
an “eccentric businessman," since Lloyd in 1905 retired from
the family business to pursue full-time his mycological
interests (Fitzpatrick, 1927), and his heart clearly was never
in business affairs. That he was a man of means is not
disputed, since, of the three Lloyd brothers, it was in large
measure Curtis who built up the remarkable collection of
books and journals housed in the Lloyd Library of Cincinnati,
a unique combination of collections on mycology, botany,
pharmacy, and entomology. The Lloyd Library contains the
largest collection of Eclectic Medical books and journals in
the world (Simons, 1972), many of course now rare and out
of print. It was C.G. Lloyd's "Memorandum of Will" which
provided the initial endowment for the library (M.A.
Flannery, personal communication). C.G. Lloyd's legacy also
persists in several sizeable natural areas that he gave to
science, i.e., one near Crittenden, Kentucky (formerly C.G.
Lloyd's farm), and three others, managed by Cornell
University, in the vicinity of Ithaca, New York. (cf. Lloyd,
1925a; Fitzpatrick,1927; Korf, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1922, four years prior to his death, Lloyd erected
his own tombstone at Crittendon, Kentucky, bearing the
inscription "Monument erected by himself for himself during
his own life to gratify his own vanity. What fools these
mortals be." This granite monument was intended by Lloyd
as "a burlesque on tombstones in general" and a satire on
mycologists who have passed "the Osler age" (Fitzpatrick,
1927). C.G. Lloyd died on November 11, 1926, at Bethesda
Hospital in Cincinnati (Simons, 1951); he was 67 years old.
During approximately the last three years of his life, Lloyd's
mycological work was hampered by failing eyesight (Lloyd,
1924f). Nonetheless, he continued, loyally, to publish on
specimens sent from his many correspondents (Lloyd,
1925b). In accordance with the dictates of his Will, his
remains were cremated and dissipated (without ceremony);
specifically, his ashes were scattered over the tombstone at
Crittendon (Simons, 1951); he was not "buried" as seems to#Misc-exposition*]
[@367#Page-header*]

[@be implied by Fitzpatrick (1927). Among other
misconceptions perpetuated about C.G. Lloyd was that his
works "laid the foundation for many new advances in ....
medical mycology" (Simons, 1951). To the contrary, we
have encountered only one article by Lloyd (Lloyd, 1904e) in
which there was a focus on the medical efficacy of fungal
material considered; and, even in this brief publication, he
was perhaps less concerned with medicinal use than with
proper pronunciation of the Native American (Piute) name
for the puffball in question. C.G. Lloyd's mycological work
is almost entirely taxonomic or mycogeographic in character.
This is in contrast to his earlier work on medicinal properties
of certain angiosperms, done primarily in collaboration with
his brother, John Uri Lloyd, as previously discussed (see for
example, J.U. and C.G. Lloyd, 1885-1886).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Part of the difficulty encountered in studying C.G.
Lloyd's works is the ability to find various parts of them. His
works occur as a number of notes, letters, bulletins, and
pamphlets. The majority of these writings and associated
photographs are bound in the seven volumes of Mycological
Writings, but in the first five volumes there is often not a
continuity of page numbers within or between volumes,
obligating the reader in many cases to "thumb through" to
find the article desired. Although the sequence of Lloyd's
writings is difficult to follow, the search is made easier if the
reader is aware of certain specific indices. The /ndex to
American Botanical Literature (1969) contains a listing of 84
publications of C.G. Lloyd as sole or senior author (some
Mycological Notes are combined under single listings),
another three publications listed being coauthored with John
Uri Lloyd (senior author). Not included or elaborated in this
index, however, are many of the published letters and
miscellaneous published notations of C.G. Lloyd; and some
scientific writings of Lloyd are not published (but are still
curated at the Lloyd Library). Some of Lloyd's "Puffball
Letters" are published, bound toward the latter part of the
first two volumes of Mycological Writings; however, it will#Misc-exposition*]
[@368#Page-header*]

[@benefit both mycologist and biographer alike to know that a
complete set of Lloyd's circulars on puffballs is collected at
the Lloyd Library (M.A. Flannery, personal communication).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most comprehensive index on Lloyd, is the
"General Index to the Mycological Writings of C.G. Lloyd"
developed by Stevenson (1933). Stevenson provided brief but
useful commentary on the nature and mode of Lloyd's
publications over the years, and their assembly into the seven
volumes of Mycological Writings. Interestingly, Stevenson
asserted that Lloyd's changing systematic viewpoints over the
years made it impractical in the index to distinguish between
recognized species and synonyms. Serious students of the
works of Lloyd should avail themselves of Stevenson's index
of Lloyd's mycological works. Also, Lloyd himself provided
various types of indices (to taxa, subjects, contributors, etc.),
bound usually at the beginning of each volume of Mycological
Writings. All of the volumes of Mycological Writings are
professionally printed by off-set, with the exception of
volume six which is "in mimeographed form." Lloyd blamed
the issuance of this volume by mimeograph on the "high cost
of printing...in order to meet the arbitrary and unreasonable
demands of organized labor..." (Lloyd, 1919). In volume six,
a larger format size was also utilized. In volume seven,
Lloyd went "back to the printers again" (Lloyd, 1922b),
implying that the price of printing had dropped; however, the
larger format size was retained. Despite what one might
infer from such penny-pinching maneuvers, Lloyd was very
generous with his readership throughout his career (e.g.,
Lloyd, 1917b), the subscription price to the many
Mycological Notes he issued being "a little personal interest
on the part of the recipient in picking up and sending to my
address, specimens of the larger fungi." In this way, Lloyd
was particularly successful in stimulating the growth of
American mycological literature, interest in mycology, and
the amplification of his own mycological herbarium. He
involved many people in mycological study who otherwise
might not have had their interest stimulated or recognized.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NEW REPORT OF LICHENS FROM SOUTHERN AFRICA#Misc-exposition*]

[@C.M. THOMAS

[@Department of Botany, University of Transkei, Private Bag XI, Umtata, South Africa#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eighteen species of lichens of the family Pyxinaceae (5), Parmeliaceae (4),
Collemaceae (3), Usneaceae (1), Lecideaceae (1) Diploschistaceae (1), Cladoniaceae
(1), Ramalinaceae (1) and Physciaceae (1) reported for the first time from South
African floristic region and are new records for southern Africa. The present paper is
the second of the series of lichenological exploration of Transkei region and provides
additional information to the previous reports. Ecology, distribution and morphological
characters are discussed. Some lichens occur only in the coastal regions while some
others are found only at high altitudes, therefore, these can be termed coastal lichens
and mountain lichens respectively. Two terricolous lichens Baeomyces and Toninia are
colonizers of bare exposed substratum that is liable to constant erosion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Carl Linnaeus was the first biologist to record lichens from South Africa. Since
1770, many others have attempted to work on lichen communities of southern Africa,
although only in recent years has increased interest developed in the various aspects of
Lichenology. Doidge (1950) compiled a complete list of all lichens reported from
southern Africa up to 1945. Considerable advancement in lichen taxonomy, anatomy
and phytochemistry have been achieved in the last two decades. Important aspects such
as lichen distribution, pollution monitors, phytosociology, and pharmacology are yet to
be established (Thomas and Bhat, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]
[@376#Page-header*]
[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new report of lichens is based on the collections and study made by the
authors in 1993 from different parts of Transkei region of South Africa (see map of
Transkei). All these collections were made from the sea level to 1800 meters. The
localities visited, their code and altitude are given in the Table 1. Three identical series
of voucher specimen lichens were made from the collections and deposited in the
herbarium of the department of Botany, University of Transkei (KEI), and in private
herbarium of the two authors. In the floristic list, each species is provided with a short
note on its morphology, ecology, and distribution. Abbreviations and the number
indicate the recording system of the voucher specimens in the herbarium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Southern Africa includes the areas such as Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana,
Namibia [South West Africa] Zimbabwe [Rhodesia], Mozambique; southern parts of
Zambia, Malawi and Angola; and South Africa including previous homelands Transkei,
Venda, Bhoputhatswana and Ciskei. The particular location of Transkei, its physio-
geographic, geomorphic features and Indian ocean have important influence on aspects
such as its climate, growth of higher plants as well as lichens. These factors together
with altitude effectively contribute to their distribution. The physical selective forces
limit the period of acquisition of resources needed for the growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Transkei is between 27°-30° E longitude and 30°-33° S latitude, has an area of
44630 Km’. The ecologic - geographic variations are from coastal region, hilly midland
to mountainous interior with sub tropical climate with hot wet summer and warm dry
winter. The "Mozambique current” that carries warm water southwards, greatly
influences the temperature of the costal region. The interior is similar to coast but
cooler with increasing elevation. The average daily minimum temperature of the coldest
month (July) is 7? c and average daily maximum temperature of hottest month (January)
is 28° c. Frost does not occur along the sea coast though, within a few kilometres of
the sea frost occurs on winter nights. The warmer less dense air of the east coast forms
precipitation more rapidly. Average rainfall in summer season is 600 mm. although it
varies greatly from place to place. Average rain fall in winter is 200 mm. Towards the
end of the winter season, this peninsular region experiences strong gale blowing from
south polar region. Relative humidity is approximately 40% in the interior and it varies
from 60% - 70% at the coast and midland. The altitude varies from sea level to 2000
m. Habitat ranges from dry mountainous area, grass topped bare hills, humid forests
and wild coast supporting varied lichen flora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The specimens collected from different localities were dried and preserved by
customary methods. Repeated visits to the cites were made at different seasons to
ascertain the growth form and pattern. Morphology of the upper and lower surfaces of
the thalli, rhizine occurrence and the fruiting bodies were examined for the
identification of the specimens. Macrophotographs and slides were prepared with a
Canon camera using close up lens x 6.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCLUSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The literature survey reveals that the eighteen species of lichens collected and
investigated are new records to southern Africa. An analysis and evaluation of the
dynamics of growth and distribution pattern of most lichens in Transkei region of
southern Africa are presented. Most of the genera are locally abundant or wide spread
in different distribution zones which indicate that most parts of Transkei remain
unexplored from lichenological point of view. Parmelia andina is reported exclusively
from east coast of South Africa. Usnea submolis occurs in high altitude areas only.
Taxa of the Collemaceae and Pyxinaceae show a strong preference to interior, is
influenced by high altitude. Ramalinaceae also shows a similar distribution pattern.
Some types of lichens establish themselves in substratum unsuitable for any form of
plant growth, can be considered as pioneers in the ecological succession (Garty, 1990).
The Cladoniaceae are restricted to higher altitudes where humidity is high. The
Teloschistaceae seems to be restricted to middle-land where savannah and shrubs
dominate. Baeomyces occurs only in the cool high-land zone of Transkei in Langeni
pine forest. Occur on bare exposed earth by road bank and tracks where erosion of soil
has taken place. Grows over acid soil or mineral soil. The water reservoir and the road
provide a break in the canopy and shade provided by the forest trees. The conditions#Misc-exposition*]
[@384#Page-header*]

[@on bare exposed ground is suitable for this terricolous lichen. It can be considered as
a colonizer of freshly exposed bare earth by tracks and roads. But Toninia are high
altitude lichens capable of colonizing bare exposed substratum. Grow in very extreme
microclimatic conditions on thin residual soil that occur in crevices of volcanic rock that
was liable to be eroded by wind or rain. It can be considered as a colonizer of exposed
rock.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ecological factors which influence the growth of lichens appear to be the
availability of light, moisture and characteristics of the host tree or substratum
(Kantvilas, 1985, 1988). In South Africa, Transkei in particular climatic variability is
high and frequent. It seems that the frequency of variations of extreme elements of
climate, sequence and the timing of these events together with geomorphic features are
important factors for the poor distribution and growth forms of lichens in this country;
rather than nature of the substratum, wild fires, competition among lichens and
bryophytes, environmental pollution or by man’s influence in nature, trampling and
predation by animals as observed in the polar regions. Some resistance and adaptation
in lichens can be expected from previous exposure to stress of the same kind as
observed in higher plants.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Baeomyces and Toninia can be considered as colonizers of a bare substratum.
As time passes, changes in the amount of shade provided by nearby trees, the decaying
leaves, moisture, marked changes in intensity of heat and light related to change of
seasons such as dry winter to wet summer in Eastern Cape and wet winter to dry
summer in Western Cape etc. changes the nature of the substrate and microclimatic
conditions. This leads to the occurrence of other species with more elaborate thalli.
Older ones are replaced by new ones. This results in succession among communities.
Lichens with crustose thalli give way to foliose types and later to mosses. The inability
of lichens to compete successfully with bryophytes is contributed by symbiotic nature
of lichens is an additional factor in favouring succession of lichen communities.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Main collecting sites for the present report include, 1) Barlow Pass, Mountain
Loop Road, Snohomish County, elevation 700 m, 2) Stevens Pass, Highway 2, King
County, elevation ca 1250 m, 3) Easy Pass Trailhead, Skagit County, near Highway
20, elevation 1140 m, 4) Rainy Pass, Chelan County, on Highway 20, elevation 1470
m, and 5) Lake Ann, Chelan County, southwest of Rainy Pass, elevation 1660 m.
The sites range in latitude from 47?45'IN to 48?30'N. All sites represent late
succession forests in the North Cascades physiographic and geologic province. The
Barlow Pass site is forested by Abies amabilis ( Dougl.) Forbes (Silver Fir) and Tsuga
heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. (Western Hemlock) and is in a cold air drainage along the
Sauk River. Stevens Pass is a subalpine conifer forest of A. amabilis, A. lasiocarpa
(Hook.) Nutt. (Subalpine Fir), 7suga mertenisiana (Bong.) Carr (Mountain Hemlock)
and Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D.Don) Spach (Alaskan Yellow Cedar) with T.
heterophylla and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco (Douglas Fir) in certain places.
Alnus sinuata (Regel) Rydb. (Sitka Alder) occurs on steep slopes and along small
streams. The Easy Pass Trailhead area is composed of a mixture of conifers, including
A. lasiocarpa and T. mertensiana, T. beteroplrylla, P. menziesii, Picea engelmannit Parry
(Engelman Spruce) and Pinus monticola Dougl. (Western White Pine). In moister
areas along Granite Creek A. sinuata and C. nootkatensis also occur. At Rainy Pass A.
amabilis and A. lasiocarpa occur with T. mertensiana as well as some P. engelmannii
and scattered P. menziesii. At Lake Ann, a truly subalpine forest occurs, dominated
by A. lasiocarpa and T. mertensiana with Larix lyallit (Perl.) (Tamarack) in some
areas. Shrubby Salix species occur at the lower end of the lake and along the outlet
stream. For the vegetation of some Wyoming localities mentionned in this paper see
Moser et al.(1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@For Methods see part 1 and part 3 of the series. Dsecriptions of microscopic
characters were taken from sections mounted in 396 KOH and spore measurements
are whenever possible from spore prints, otherwise from cortina or lamellae.
Inidation of lamella density: L = total number of lamellae reaching the stipe and l =
number of lamellulae between two lamellae. Comparison of the lamella width with
the thickness of the pileus context was made about half the radius of the pileus.
Abbreviations in spore measurements: S$ = standard deviation (n = 31), Q = quotient
of spore lenght through spore width, V = approximate volume. Color guides include
Munsel Soil Color Charts (example of notation, Mu 2.5YR2/4) and R. Ridgway,
Color Standards and Color nomenclature (example, Carob Brown (R)), A.Cailleux,
Code des Couleurs des Sols (Example, Caill 55S). Macrochemical color reactions were
made with 3% or 30% KOH and/or saturated NH,OH. Collections of M. Moser are
deposited at the Institut fiir Botanik der Universitat Innsbruck (IB) and those of J.
Ammirati (JFA) at the University of Washington Herbarium (WTU). Where IB and

[@Comments: We are convinced that our record is identical with
Cortinarius blattoi Mazza, recently described from subalpine forests in northern Italy.
However, we must have some reservations because we were unable to obtain the type
collection for comparison, in spite of several attempts. Cortinarius blattoi is closely
related to C. praestans Cord. and has several characters in common with it, including
the coloration of pileus and veil, the often wrinkled pileus surface and the compact
context. C. blattoi has smaller basidiomata and much smaller spores than C. praestans.
It has on the other side the typical KOH reaction in common with the group of C.
balteatus. Cortinarius duvissimus (Mos.) Mos. is an other European species in this#Description*]

[@group with similar, but narrower spores, more vinaceous to violaceous brown pileus
colors and an ochraceous universal veil. Cortinarius nebularis Hry. ex Hry. also might
be eventually found to belong to this group but it has a more dingy whitish to
grayish pileus color (similar to Clitocybe nebularis or Hygrophorus agathosmus), the
pileus surface is not wrinkled and it is associated with broadleaf trees. The chemical
reactions with ammonia and potassium hydroxid seem to be similar but more
pronounced and vivid in C. nebularis. Cetto (1987, vol.5, pl. 1781) figures the fungus
under the erroneous name Cortinarius corruscans. Blatto (1988) figures and describes
a similar fungus under the name Cortinarius pseudobalteatus Blatto. The plate of

[@Comments: Smith (1944) placed this taxon in Subgenus Myxacium, ain
agreement with the general definition of the subgenus: glutinous surface of pileus and
stipe. However, he also stressed the similarity of C. griseoviolaceus and C.
alboviolaceus Fr. Brandrud et al.(1989) regard C. griseoviolaceus as a synonym of C.
emunctus Fr.(= C. griseolilacinus Britz.). This synonymy is certainly incorrect. They
may have been misled by the black-and-white photograph published by Smith (1944)
which shows some abnormally slender and long-stipitate fruitbodies. C.
griseoviolaceus, however, has no similarity with C. emunctus, neither in macroscopic
nor microscopic characters. Its relationship lies with Sericeocybe and it very closely
resembles C. alboviolaceus when dry. Gelatinization of the surface layers of pileus and
stipe are characters widely used by cortinariologists to separate subgenera. Certainly
this is a rather convenient means for classification. As a result of having studied
Cortinarii from several continents, however, we have come to the conclusion, that
these characters have independently evolwed several times in Cortinarius. We know
a group of typical Telamonias from the Southern Hemisphere which have a distinct
gelatinous pileus surface (Moser & Horak 1975) and some species of subgenus
Icterinula have the same characteristic. In Sericeocybe we know several taxa even from
Europe, which show at least some tendency for gelatinization of the pileus surface.
So we are inclined to regard C. griseoviolaceus as a taxon closely related to C.
alboviolaceus but with a gelatinized surface layer on pileus and stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: The species was described by the senior author under the
name C. canabarba (Moser 1966) from Carinthia, Austria. Later it became known
from northern Finland (Kuusamo) and Jamtland in Sweden and finally, from South
Tyrol (Italy). The discovery of two paintings of C. H. Kauffman of his C. umidicola
and a comparative study of the types convinced us of the identity of the two species.
Cortinarius canabarba Mos. becomes thus a synonym of C. umidicola Kauffm.
Kauffman collected the fungus in the Appalachian Mountains. The holotype comes
from Freeville, Tompkins Co, NY, 22 Aug 1904. The spores of the type are of the
same size and shape but slightly more verrucose than in C.canabarba.#Misc-exposition*]

of Kauffman came from Houghton, Michigan, 22 Jul. 1906, collected in maple and
birch ravines. This is different from the typical habitat. The spores are more
heterogeneous and seem partly immature. Also the painting is less convincing. A
collection of H.E.Bigelow det. A.H.Smith (Smith 48279) from Mt. Rainier National
Park, Washington, has similar smaller spores but is still in the range of variability for
C. umidicola. In addition there are some cheilocystidia. However, some banal ,
mostly cylindric to clavate types oft sterile cells in Telamonia are a rather inconstant
character and depend often on weather conditions during the development of the
basidiomata. There is also a painting by C.H.Kauffman under the name "C. plumiger
Fr." from North Elba, Adirondack Mountains, under spruce and birch, 14-09-1914.
This collection is strikingly similar to C. smidicola and the spores agree well with
those of C. umidicola. The protologue of Fries for C. plumiger differs, however, in
several points. Fries calls the veil "candidus" and the squamules on the pileus
"floccose-plumosis densis albis", the color of the pileus "udus fuscescens subolivaceus,
siccus testaceo-alutaceus" which suggests a much stronger hygrophanity as observed
in C. umidicola.#Description*]

[@It is interesting to note that Kauffman (1918) writes of C. umidicola: “This
species is probably identical with one occurring in Europe. I collected a very similar
plant with the same gregarious habit, near Stockholm, Sweden, while in company
with Romell, Maire and Peltereaux, who did non recognize it as a species definitely
known to them." He discusses then the possibility of an identity with C. /ucorum Fr.
and in North American Flora (1932) he synonymizes C. umidicola with C. lucorum
Fr. The label on a collection under the name C. /ucorum Fr. made by Kauffman near
Stockholm on 7 Sept. 1908 and determined by R. Maire includes the following
remarcs: "C. umidicola Kauff. is identical, C. H. K.- Romell did not know it. Maire
later suggested the name for another collection, and it seems to be the plant and not
C. impennis. " In the European literature we find at least two different interpretations
of C. [ucorum. Neither of them corresponds to C. umidicola.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: The specimens from the Cascade Mountains agree fully with
European material. The dark color of the pileus is typical and contrasts with the
relatively bright lamellae. The vinaceous brown universal veil and the rather small,
subglobose spores are also characteristic. These are all characters given by A.H.Smith
(1944) for his C. nigrellus var. occidentalis. A study of the holotype confirmed the
identity. This raises the question of priority. If the taxon is really a variety of C.
nigrellus Peck, Smith’s name would have priority. We have not seen the type of Peck.
Kauffman (1932) gives spores measurements of 7-7.5 x 4-5 µm, in a collection of
A.H.Smith (4912) we found ellipsoid to almond-shaped spores of 8-10 x 4.8-5.4 µm.
The descriptions of Peck and Kauffman seem to indicate, that the small spores are the
only character which the two taxa have in common. There are, however, many
characters (color, vinaceous veil, size) which favour separation at the species level. In
this case C. badiovinaceus Mos. (1965) has priority.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: Moser (1983) interpreted this taxon as C. inctsus in the sense
of Fries. The reasons for so doing are: it shows the macroscopic characters assigned
to it by Fries very well, the figure given by Fries in Icones pl.160,1 comes from
Femsjó material and this taxon is not rare in that area even today. Also Nathorst-
Windahl (1958) had the same concept. Other species with similar macroscopic
characters but different spore types could not be found around Femsjö during the last
fourty years. However, C. incisus is not a species of Fries but was first described by
Persoon. The short description of Persoon does not permit a positive interpretation.
In consequence the concept of this taxon in the literature is rather confused. The
spore measurements given by different authors vary greatly, e.g. Bresadola : 9-12 x 5-7
µm, R.Henry 10 x 8 µm (but according to measurements by Kühner on material of
Henry 7-9 x 5-5.5 µm), Kühner & Romagnesi 8.5-9.5 x 5-5.5 µm, J.E.Lange 7-7.5 x 4-
4.5 µm, Moser in earlier interpretations 7.5-9 x 4-5 µm, Quelet "pruniform, 10 µm
long, Rea 8-9 x 5-6 µm. Ricken gives spores of 8-9 x 5-6 µm, but his fungus is a larger#Misc-exposition*]

[@one.#Misc-exposition*]

[@If one should consider C.incisus as a nomen confusum, the next available name
seems to be C. impolitus Kauff. 1918. The above described collection from
Washington agrees well with the concept of C.incisus of Moser (1983), based on
material collected in the Femsjó area in Sweden. The spores have the characteristic
slender shape, but slightly smaller, however, the measurements are overlapping.
Moreover we have only seen a single collection from America, so we can not judge
the range of variability. Other collections by Kauffman and A.H.Smith under this
name have somewhat larger spores as can be seen from table 2. Also in Europe the
species is often found on rather dry habitats, sandy soils or road sides. The taxon
decribed by Kauffman (1932) under the name C. incisus is different. However, a study
of the holotype and other collections of Cortinarius impolitus Kauffm. revealed that
it is conspecific with C. incisus ss.Fr., Mos. This is corroborated by the shape and size
of the spores of the holotype (8-11 x 44.7 µm) and the habit and color of the
basidiomata and the habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the literature we find descriptions of several small species of Telamonia
with fusoid spores, all with somewhat similar macroscopic characters: C. impolitus
Kauff., C. fusisporus Kühn.(1955), C. belleri Mos.(1983)(= C. longisporus Beller (1982)
nom. illeg.), C. incisus ss. Fr.(1836-38, 1863, 1884), Nathorst-Windahl (1958),
Mos.1983 non Pers., C. semivestitus Mos. (1967), C. lux-nymphae Mel. (1989), C.
heterosporus Bres. in Henn. (1885), C. scobinaceus Mal. & Bert. (1970). The question
arises whether all these taxa or some of them are conspecific or whether they or
some of them represent distinct but closely related taxa. The macroscopic characters
show not very much variation. C. semivestitus differs by a strongly developed,
ochraceous veil consisting of relatively thick hyphae (5-11 zm) with yellowish walls.
All others have white veils with hyphae of 3-7 µm broad. C. lux-nymphae has
significantly smaller spores (6.5-8.5 x 3-3.5 µm). C. heterosporus Bres. has very slender
spores of (7)-7.5-10.5x2.5-3.7 µm and has at the base of the stipe small reddish
ochraceous to brick- or fire-red floccose-fibrillose squamules. In a collection made by
C. Bas from the Netherlands (Bas 4789) we found spore measurements of (7)-7.5-
10.5x2.5-3.7 µm and the red hyphae from the base of stipe 5-7(-8) µm wide with
intracellular, but evidently not anthraquinonic pigment. The pileus colors are
vinaceous to purple brown. And C. scobinaceus seems to belong to the group of C.
psammocephalus, strobilaceus, to judge from the original description and own recolts
from the mediterranean area. These four taxa can seemingly be excluded from the
complex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. impolitus Kauff., C. incisus ss. Fr., Mos., and C. belleri are species from x
dry habitats, often sandy or loamy soils. They are described with finely squamulose
to scaly pileus surface, with short stipes and often growing fasciculate.
Unfortunately the holotype of Cfusisporus was not available while we have prepared
this publication. Kühner reports it from a site under conifers among heather and
indicates a glabrous pileus surface and a relatively longer stipe. Are these differences
only due to phenetic responses to growth under different ecological conditions ? This
is a question which hardly can be answered on the basis of macro- and microscopic
observations. Perhaps molecular data can solve such problems in future.#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. belleri can be interpreted as an ecological variety or subspecies growing
under Cistus. Bon (1986) declared the name C.belleri (= C. longisporus Beller 1982) as
a nomen superfluum, because he regarded C.longisporus (Murr.) Singer as an invalid
name. However, he has overlooked, that Singer made this combination not 1962 but
403#Page-header*]

[@already in Lilloa vol.22, 1949 ( publ.1951), i.e. before 1 January 1953. Thus the
combination of Singer is valid and C. longisporus Beller becomes a later homonym
and illegitimate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@in india Trametes roseola Pat.h Har. cosmoniy grows on dead hardwoods

where it causes a brown rot. The fungus also occurs in Africa,Casbodia,

Japan,Sri Lanka and Thailand (Bakshi 1971,Ryvarden & Johansea 1980). The

present paper reports the resuits of detailed studies on the morphological
and cultural characters of T.roseola. The taxonomy of the species is also

discussed in the light of these findings.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Observations were based on fresh specimens collected by the authors from
Oehra üun,U.P..índia. Nacroscopic characters of the basidiocarps were
studied from free hand sections mounted in 10% KOH and stained with 1%
Cotton blue. Cultures were established from context tissues of these
basidiocarps and studied following the methods of Nobles (1948) and
Wobles et ai.11957). Oxidase reactions were tested by the Bavendams
method as described by Davidson et ai. (1938). Voucher specimens and
cultures are maintained in the Mycoiogical Herbarium of the Visva-Bharati

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species has been described as a member of the genus Trametes by
different workers but Trametes roseola Pat.& Har. closely resembles
Daedalea quercina L.ex Fr.,the type species of the genus Daedalea Pers.
ex Fr. Both T.roseola and D.quercina cause brown rots,produece no
extracellular oxidase in culture, possess a bipolar type of sexuality and
consist of thin-walled as well as thick-walled generative hyphae including
generative hyphae with characteristic irregular wall thickening. It is
to be noted here that,although Van der Vesthuizen (1971},from comparative
cultural and anatomical studies on D.quercina ,concluded it to be a
disitic species,several workers including Cunningham (1948), Teston 11953},
Kotiaba and Pouzar (1957},Domanski et at.(1973) and Ryvarden (1976)
described the species as trisitic. In possessing a trimitic hyphal system
T.coseota therefore closely resembles D.quercina,the type species of
Dasdalea, The species code describing the culture characteristics of
B.quercina (Nobles 1965) also comes close to that of T.roseola. Thus so
wany features in common suggest a close relationship between T.roseola
and D.quercina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Therefore,it is conciuded that T.roseola and D.quercina are congeneric,
and T.roseoia is transferred to Daedalea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Four species of Valsaria are recognized: Valsaria bambusae, V.
fulvopruinata, V. insitiva, and V. rubricosa. Cultures and anamorph of V.
bambusae are newly described herein. An annotated list is provided for
epithets associated with Valsaria and its synonyms --- including
Myrmaecium, Phaeocreopsis, and Hypoxylonopsis --- and Valsonectria.
Endoxylina and Pseudothyridaria are resurrected to accommodate some
segregates of Valsaria. A more complete list of synonyms for
Pseudovalsaria ferruginea is provided. Three segregates of Valsaria are
combined with Roussoella. Eight species of Roussoella are accepted,
including two new species, R. alveolata and R. intermedia, and three new
combinations, R. chilensis, R. donacicola, and R. pustulans. Keys to the
genera discussed and to taxa of Valsaria and Roussoella are provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Key words: Endoxylina, Hypoxylonopsis, Myrmaecium, Phaeocreopsis,
Pseudothyridaria, Pseudovalsaria, Roussoella, Valsaria, Valsonectria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomic position of Valsaria Ces. & De Not. has been
controversial partially owing to its heterogeneity. Originally, Valsaria was
erected to accommodate ascomycetes with valsoid ascomatal configurations
and two-celled, colored ascospores. Later, Saccardo (1882) complicated the
matter by expanding the generic concept to include fungi with eutypoid
ascomatal configurations. The original definition of Valsaria had already
embraced a heterogenous assemblage of fungi. Saccardo further blurred the
distinctions among Valsaria and other fungi that have two-celled, colored
ascospores, e.g., Amphisphaeria Ces. & De Not. and Didymosphaeria
Fuckel. The heterogeneity of Valsaria led Wehmeyer (1926) to place some
species, e.g., V. moroides (Cooke & Peck) Sacc. [= Pseudovalsaria
ferruginea (Nitschke) Rappaz] and V. allantospora Ellis & Everh. [=#Misc-exposition*]
[@420#Page-header*]

[@Endoxylina allantospora (Ellis & Everh.) Shoemaker & Egger], into the
Allantosphaeriaceae and some other species, e.g., V. insitiva (Tode: Fr.)
Ces. & De Not. and V. exasperans (W. Gerard) Sacc. [= V. fulvopruinata
(Berk.) Sacc.], into the Diaporthaceae. Later, ascal features were used to
classify fungi into those with unitunicate asci --- the Pyrenomycetes --- and
those with bitunicate asci --- the Loculoascomycetes. Although this provided
a more natural classification for most other ostiolate fungi, it imposed new
problems on Valsaria. Members of Valsaria as defined herein were
considered by Dennis (1960), Kobayashi (1970), Kobayasi and Doi (1969),
and Munk (1953, 1957) to be bitunicate fungi, but were believed by Barr
(1978, 1990a), Dennis (1978), Glawe (1985), Huhndorf (1992a), Miller (1949),
and Müller and von Arx (1962) to be unitunicate. However, most ofthem
have agreed that the hamathecial elements of these fungi are hypha-like,
elongate upward toward the ostiole, and have free ends, and that the
ascomata have a wall distinct from the surrounding stromatal tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study, Valsaria is considered to have bitunicate asci, a true
ascomatal wall, and paraphysate hamathecial elements. Unfortunately, this
combination of characteristics makes it difficult to place the genus into any
presently defined higher taxon of either Pyrenomycetes or
Loculoascomycetes. On the basis of the asci we are inclined to consider
Valsaria among the Loculoascomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leuchtmann and Miller (1986) reported the life cycle of Thyridium
vestitum (Fr.: Fr.) Fuckel, the type species of that genus. Pleurocytospora
vestita Petr. was demonstrated to be its coelomycetous state. In addition, a
hyphomycetous synanamorph, which produces yeast-like blastoconidia, was
proven. Interestingly, ascospores of T. vestitum germinate by either budding
off conidia or producing germ hyphae, a phenomenon commonly observed in
Valsaria (see below). Coincidentally, Thyridium Nitschke has suffered the
same fate as Valsaria, i.e., not being unequivocally assignable to either the
Pyrenomycetes or Loculoascomycetes. Thyridium vestitum was considered
to have bitunicate asci by Dennis (1978) [under Fenestella Tul. & C. Tul.],
Munk (1957) [under Fenestella], and Wehmeyer (1975), but to have
unitunicate asci by Barr (1983, 1990a) and Eriksson and Yue (1989). We are
not yet in the position to assess the taxonomic placement of this fungus.
However, similarities between the synanamorphs of T. vestitum and Valsaria
taxa, respectively, are recognized.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study four species are recognized in Valsaria. In addition, some
genera that have been entangled with Valsaria are also discussed.
Endoxylina Romell and Pseudothyridaria Petr. are resurrected. A few
Valsaria names are found to belong to Pseudovalsaria Spooner. A more
complete list of synonyms is provided for P. foedans (P. Karst.) Spooner [=
P. ferruginea (Nitschke) Rappaz]. Valsaria chilensis Speg., V. donacicola
Speg., and V. pustulans (Ellis & Everh.) Sacc. are assigned to Roussoella
Sacc. Roussoella is revised, with eight species accepted.#Misc-exposition*]
[@421#Page-header*]
[@VALSARIA CES. & DE NOT.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cesati and De Notaris (1863), in Valsaria, listed four names: Valsaria
insitiva, V. donacina (Fr.: Fr.) Ces. & De Not., V. decorticans (Fr.: Fr.) Ces.
[@& De Not., and V. periplocae (De Not.) Ces. & De Not. Additionally, they
also listed five Sphaeria names under Valsaria; these were somehow not
combined with the generic name. Clements and Shear (1931) chose V.
insitiva as the type species of the genus; this was followed by most
mycologists, e.g., Miller and von Arx (1962) and Barr (1978). Curiously,
Munk (1953) typified Va/saria with V. foedans (P. Karst.) Sacc. which was
not listed in Cesati and De Notaris (1863). As V. insitiva is the type species
of the genus, its identity affects the generic concept. Cesati and De Notaris
(1863) cited Diatrype insitiva (Tode: Fr.) Fr. as well as Sphaeria insitiva
Tode: Fr. under V. insitiva. Although the authority of Sphaeria insitiva has
since been considered to be Tode, the modern definition of the name was, in
fact, given by De Notaris (1853). According to Hawksworth (1974), the Tode
herbarium has been destroyed. Regrettably, we can only conjecture about
Tode's fungus from the original description and illustrations (Tode, 1791). It
appears to us that Tode's Sphaeria insitiva is not the same as De Notaris’.
Tode's fungus was said to have widely-effused stromata with a white surface
and an eutypoid ascomatal configuration. Although Saccardo (1882) believed
Tode's Sphaeria insitiva to be Cryptovalsa ampelina (Nitschke) Fuckel, the
real identity of Tode's fungus is unknown. If we accept Tode's concept of
Sphaeria insitiva, the application of Valsaria will be uncertain. One
potential solution is to consider De Notaris as publishing a later homonym,
Sphaeria insitiva "De Not.", on which the combination Valsaria insitiva was
based. In doing so, although making Valsaria insitiva an illegitimate name,
we can Stabilize the use of the genus name. Valsaria robiniae (Schwein.:
Fr.) Cooke could then be used as a Substitute for V. insitiva “(De Not.) Ces.
& De Not." Another potential solution to avoid losing the use of Valsaria
might involve selecting one of the three other Va/saria names listed by
Cesati and De Notaris (1863) as the type. Valsaria decorticans is
unfortunately a synonym of Valsa ceratosperma (Tode: Fr.) Maire. Under V.
decorticans, Cesati and De Notaris (1863) cited Rabenhorst's Fungi
Europaei no. 146. The exsiccatum at RO [SWITZERLAND: Geneva, Duby,
as Valsa decorticans Fr.] with the signature of De Notaris is a Diaporthe
Nitschke. Valsaria donacina is a nomen dubium (see the list of names
herein). There is no material of V. periplocae at RO. The De Notaris
original pencil sketch preserved at RO leaves no doubt that V. periplocae is
a synonym of V. insitiva. Selecting V. periplocae as the type does not make
more sense than considering that De Notaris himself published Sphaeria
insitiva. These two potential solutions can only stablize the use of the
generic name, Valsaria, but not the species epithet, insitiva.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The solution that we propose herein is also propounded to save insitiva
as an epithet. The fungus bearing this epithet is widespread, probably
cosmopolitan, and has a wide host and substrate range. If one considers De
Notaris himself as publishing S. insitiva rather than redescribing Tode's S.
insitiva, Sphaeria robiniae will predate S. insitiva “De Not.” To lose
insitiva to robiniae --- a forgotten name that implies host specificity toward
Robinia L. --- seems counterproductive, especially because changes in the#Misc-exposition*]
[@422#Page-header*]

[@Code of Botanical Nomenclature are now aimed to minimize the
displacement of well-established names for purely nomenclatural reasons
(Hawksworth, 1993). Our solution is, as follows. Material of Sphaeria
insitiva Tode --- type material --- is unavailable and presumed destroyed.
Tode's description and illustrations (1791) are possibly of another fungus, but,
because ascospores and other critical structures are not described, we cannot
be entirely certain. The host for Tode's collection (1791) is Vitis L. De
Notaris (1853) accepted Sphaeria insitiva based on Tode's description and
illustrations (1791) and the descriptions of others. He apparently did not see
Tode's material, but described and illustrated material from Vitis. His
description encompasses a considerable amount of variation in the fungus
and established the modern concept of the species which later became
accepted as the type species for Valsaria Ces. & De Not. (Clements and
Shear, 1931) His drawings further reinforce his description. We thus propose
that one of the De Notaris' original specimens from RO be designated as
interpretive type or the epitype [see Greuter et al. (1994) and Hawksworth
(1993) for definition] for Sphaeria insitiva, the basionym of Valsaria insitiva
(Tode: Fr.) Ces. & De Not., because of the inadequacy of Tode's holotype
illustrations and description (Tode, 1791). There are four packets at RO
labeled as Sphaeria insitiva Tode by De Notaris. One packet, collected in
1839, contains material of a Valsa Fr. Two packets, both collected in 1842,
contain only immature material of V. insitiva. The fourth packet [ITALY:
1837, vines of Vitis] contains adequate material of V. insitiva. It is herein
designated as the epitype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Myrmaecium Nitschke ex Fuckel was first validly published by Fuckel
(1869-70) who listed two species: M. rubricosum (Fr.: Fr.) Fuckel and M.
durissimum Fuckel. Both names are synonyms of Valsaria rubricosa (Fr.:
Fr.) Sacc. It remains unclear to us as to why Clements and Shear (1931)
cited "M. insitiva (Fr.) Fkl." as the type. In fact, Fuckel (1869-70) did not
formally mention Valsaria insitiva; neither did he ever combine this species
with Myrmaecium. The combination Myrmaecium insitivum was made by
Lindau (1897). In 1880, Saccardo (see Saccardo, 1882) published a later
homonym of Myrmaecium Nitschke ex Fuckel for some fungi with hyaline
ascospores. Myrmaeciella Lindau was later used by Lindau (1897) to be a
nomenclatural substitute for Saccardo's Myrmaecium. Müller and von Arx
(1962, 1973) considered Myrmaeciella to be a synonym of Hypocreopsis P.
Karst., as did Rogerson (1970). According to G. J. Samuels (pers. comm.),
Myrmaeciella endoleuca (Sacc.) Lindau, the type species of that genus, is
very unlikely to be a hypocrealean fungus and thus Myremaeciella is not
considered to be a synonym of Hypocreopsis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Kobayasi and Doi (1969) description of Phaeocreopsis
hypoxyloides Speg., the type species of Phaeocreopsis Speg., is in full
accordance with Valsaria rubricosa. They compared their Japanese
specimens with the Spegazzini type from LPS.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saccardo (1926) treated Hypoxylonopsis Henn. as a synonym of
Valsaria. The type species of Hypoxylonopsis, H. hurae Henn., was
considered to be a synonym of Valsaria hypoxyloides Rehm [= V.#Misc-exposition*]
[@423#Page-header*]

[@rubricosa] by Miller and von Arx (1962). Our observation on the type of H.
hurae at HBG reaffirms the synonymy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Valsonectria Speg., typified by V. pulchella Speg., has been used to
harbor some Valsaria names. Valsaria hypoxyloides Rehm and
Melogramma cinnamomi Ces., both synonyms of Valsaria rubricosa, were,
respectively, placed in Valsonectria by Barr (1990a) and by Huhndorf
(1992a). However, Lindau (1897), Petrak and Sydow (1936), Miller and von
Arx (1962), and Rogerson (1970) considered the type species of the genus,
V. pulchella Speg., to be a hypocrealean fungus. G. J. Samuels (pers.
comm.) studied V. pulchella and also considered it to be hypocrealean.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We accept four species in the genus herein: Valsaria bambusae Kapoor
& Gill, V. fulvopruinata (Berk.) Sacc., V. insitiva, and V. rubricosa.
Valsaria sphaerophora (Ellis & Everh.) Barr, growing on Agave from Mexico
and known only from the type specimen, is a probable member of the genus.
It has functionally bitunicate asci and a probably paraphysate hamathecium.
We prefer not to make any formal taxonomic decision about the fungus until
more specimens and, hopefully, cultures are available for study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While morphological features of Valsaria tend to be fairly constant, their
hosts are quite variable in three of the four species. This partially accounts
for the numerous names that have been erected for V. insitiva and V.
rubricosa. Valsaria insitiva and V. rubricosa have world-wide distribution,
whereas V. fulvopruinata is known only in North America and Europe and
may eventually be proven to be restricted in northern temperate regions.
Valsaria bambusae, on the other hand, is known as a bamboo-inhabiting
fungus only from India thus far.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Valsaria are capable of producing two synanamorphs: one is
coelomycetous and the other is hyphomycetous. The coelomycetous
synanamorph of V. insitiva was ascribed to Cytosporella Sacc. by
Wehmeyer (1923) and Glawe (1985). The hyphomycetous synanamorph was
first described in V. insitiva by Glawe (1985) who referred to it as Exophiala-
like. It was subsequently referred to as Hyphozyma-like by De Hoog and
McGinnis (1987), and it was suggested to us that it was Hormonema-like by
W. A. Untereiner (pers. comm.). Taxa of Hormonema Lagerberg & Melin
have been connected with coelomycetous synanamorphs, whereas taxa of
Exophiala J. W. Carmichael and Hyphozyma De Hoog & M. T. Sm. have
only been connected to hyphomycetous synanamorphs (see De Hoog and
McGinnis, 1987). On account of Valsaria taxa being capable of producing
coelomycetous synanamorphs, it is more reasonable to refer their
hyphomycetous synanamorphs to Hormonema. It is noteworthy that
ascomycetes with connections with black yeasts are predominantly
loculoascomycetous. This again reinforces our view of Valsaria being
loculoascomycetous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A general life cycle of Valsaria is as follows.#Description*]

[@Ascospores germinate by producing yeast-like budding cells or, less
frequently, by producing germ tubes. This is followed by the production of
hyphae directly from which one-celled, hyaline conidia are produced
holoblastically. This stage is Hormonema-like. Sometimes, conidiogenous
loci proliferate percurrently. Hyphae frequently disarticulate into
arthroconidium-like cells. Subsequently, Cytosporella-like conidiomata are
formed in most taxa except for V. rubricosa. These conidiomata bear
another type of conidium which is one-celled, hyaline, extremely small.
These conidia have not been seen to germinate, and may eventually be
proven to be spermatia. Conidiogenous cells have minute collarettes and are
thickened periclinally, and sometimes are annellated. Teleomorphs are
known to be produced only in cultures of V. rubricosa.#Description*]

[@NOTES: The ascospore ornamentation was not described in the
protologue. Kale (1970) reexamined the type, and reported that the
ascospores have longitudinal ribs. In fact, the patterns of ornamentation vary
among different ascospores, from reticulate to longitudinally ribbed. A
number of ascospores tend to have a reticulate pattern toward the ends and a
ribbed pattern toward the septum. Valsaria bambusae is closely related to
V. insitiva with which it shares most characteristics except for having a
different ascospore ornamentation and, in average, a larger ascospore size
range. It is noteworthy that V. bambusae is host-specific --- reported only on
bamboo culms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Valsaria bambusae produces two types of conidia in culture: small
phialoconidia in the Cytosporella-like synanamorph and large blastoconidia
in the Hormonema-like synanamorph. The phialoconidia are collectively dull
orange and are only found in conidiomatal locules, whereas the blastoconidia
are collectively opalescent and can be found both on the surface of mycelia
and in conidiomatal locules. The life cycle of V. bambusae resembles that of
V. insitiva except for some conidiomatal locules producing blastoconidia.
The conidiomatal locules of V. insitiva produce only phialoconidia.#Description*]

[@NOTES: Wehmeyer (1923) [as V. exasperans] cultured this fungus on
Leonian's agar and reported the conidiomatal locules as labyrinthiform. He
referred this conidial state to Cytosporella Sacc. Recently, we obtained
cultures of V. fulvopruinata from a 12-year-old specimen, Barr no. 6905, and
reaffirmed Wehmeyer's observation. Furthermore, Wehmeyer (1923) noted
that hyphae “broke up into an oidia-like formation”. Thus, apparently he
observed hyphal disarticulation to form arthroconidium-like cells. However,
he did not observe the Hormonema-like synanamorph.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Valsaria fulvopruinata and V. rubricosa are more closely related to
each other than to either V. insitiva or V. bambusae. Valsaria
fulvopruinata and V. rubricosa are similar in having more colorful stromatal
Surfaces, in having vinaceous KOH-extractable pigments, and in having fine
conspicuous reticulation on ascospores. They differ mainly in stromatal
surface colors and in the large fluorescing ascal apical ring of the latter
species. Furthermore, Valsaria fulvopruinata usually produces a valsoid
ascomatal configuration and a stellate pattern on the stromatal surface.
Valsaria fulvopruinata is commonly found in eastern North America. We
have seen only two specimens outside this region: one from Oregon, U.S.A.
and one from Czechoslovakia. A specimen from Puerto Rico [Yanko,
10.2.1915, Fink, B., Petrak's Mycotheca Generalis 100, dead bark, as
Valsaria hypoxyloides (NY)] is likely to be the present fungus. However, its
immature status does not allow us to make a positive identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type material of Sphaeria fulvopruinata at the Berkeley herbarium
(K) is immature. However, Berkeley's pencil drawing of asci and ascospores
on the paper card of the specimen is characteristic for this fungus and proves
that he must have seen the teleomorphic structures. Currey (1858) had also
observed and depicted the asci and ascospores. His measurement for the
ascospores is 0.0006-0.0007 inch (ca. 15-18 1m) long. It is also noteworthy
that this specimen had had two pieces of material. A spot with a mixture of
dried glue and wood tissue on the paper card indicates that a piece was
removed. It is probable that the removed piece contained mature#Misc-exposition*]

[@teleomorphic structures from which Berkeley made the drawing. Valsaria
exasperans is a better known name for this fungus; unfortunately, its
basionym was preceded by S. fulvopruinata. Moreover, the type material of
V. exasperans was not located. Sphaeria decorticans Kunze ex Ces. & De
Not., based on a specimen of Kunze, was published by Cesati and De Notaris
(1863) with a brief diagnosis. Although the name was listed by them under
Valsaria, it was not combined with the genus until Erbario Crittogamico
Italiano. No. 1280 of the exsiccata has "Valsaria decorticans" on the label.
However, material in no. 1280 at RO is V. rubricosa which had been
examined by Traverso and led him (Traverso, 1906) to synonymize Sphaeria
decorticans with V. rubricosa.#Misc-exposition*]

Their differences are discussed in the NOTES on the latter fungus herein.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Berkeley (1876) credited Schweinitz as being the author of Diatrype
viticola and cited specimen 4975 from South Carolina. Saccardo (1882)
combined the epithet with Va/saria and cited Diatrype viticola "Schwein." as
a synonym. Meanwhile, Saccardo (1882) also transferred Sphaeria viticola
Schwein.: Fr. to Eutypa Tul. & C. Tul. and stressed that Diatrype viticola is
hardly different from V. insitiva. We examined both specimen no. 4975 from
K, which was labelled as Sphaeria viticola Schwein., and Schweinitz's
original material of S. viticola [U.S.A.: North Carolina, Salem, Syn. 1290,
twigs of Vitis rotundifolia (HOLOTYPE of Sphaeria viticola)] from PH. The
former is the same as V. insitiva, whereas the latter is the same as
Creosphaeria sassafras (Schwein.: Fr.) Y.-M. Ju, San Martín, & J. D.
Rogers, a xylariaceous fungus. It is not yet known why Saccardo made the
combination Eutypa viticola (Schwein.: Fr.) Sacc. for Sphaeria viticola#Misc-exposition*]

[@Schwein.: Fr. It is certainly possible that there are still some fragments of
Schweinitz's original material in some other herbaria that correspond with an
Eutypa. |n any case, we consider Berkeley as publishing a new name,
Diatrype viticola, and consider specimen no. 4975, which was cited by
Berkeley (1876), to be the holotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have not examined the type of V. tamaricis Mundkur & Ahmad from
India. Probable authentic material from Pakistan [Rahim Yar Khan,
25.8.1964, on Tamarix articulata (ZT)] shows that this name may represent
a variant of V. insitiva. The material has ascospores slightly smaller, 12-14 x
6-7 µm, and more light-colored than V. insitiva but is otherwise identical to
the latter. Further studies, including culturing, are needed to determine its
taxonomic status.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES: This fungus has recently been transferred to Valsonectria
Speg., independently, by Barr (1990a) and by Huhndorf (1992a). They both
considered that V. rubricosa and V. insitiva are not congeneric. When life
cycles as well as morphology of both teleomorphs and anamorphs are taken
into account, the similarity between these two fungi is far greater than the
dissimilarity. Differences exist only in stromatal surface colors, in whether a
stellate pattern is present or absent on the stromatal surfaces, in whether or
not stromatal pigments are extractable by KOH solution, and in ascomatal
configurations. With the existence of V. fulvopruinata, the idea of
separating V. rubricosa and V. insitiva into different genera is further
challenged. Like V. rubricosa, Valsaria fulvopruinata has a colorful
stromatal surface and stromatal pigments which are extractable by KOH
solution. On the other hand, it has, like V. insitiva, a stellate pattern on the
stromatal surface and a valsoid ascomatal configuration.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Valsaria rubricosa is the only taxon in the genus that is not known to
have the Cytosporella state and that is known to produce teleomorph in
culture. Tulasne and Tulasne (1863) described and illustrated a
coelomycetous state associated with this fungus from the natural substrate.#Misc-exposition*]

Unfortunately, we were not able to locate it. However, the description and
illustrations in Kar and Maity (1979) leave no doubt that V. reticulata is a
synonym of V. rubricosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ROUSSOELLA SACC.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three bamboo-inhabiting fungi that have been combined with Valsaria
should be excluded from the genus mainly because of their trabeculate
hamathecial elements. They appear to be closely related to Roussoella
hysterioides (Ces.) Hóhn. We accordingly make new combinations within
that genus. We have also examined the published epithets of Roussoella
and provide a key to the accepted species. Roussoella has commonly been
considered to belong to the Amphisphaeriaceae of Pyrenomycetes (e.g.,
Müller and von Arx, 1973; Wehmeyer, 1975; Aptroot, 19953). On the other
hand, Roussoella was synonymized with Didymosphaeria Fuckel, a
loculoascomycetous genus, by Theissen and Sydow (1915), Saccardo (1926),
Clements and Shear (1931), and Hawksworth et al. (1983). Roussoella has
bitunicate asci and trabeculate hamathecial elements, and we place it in the
Didymosphaeriaceae, Melanommatales. Roussoella seems to differ from
Didymosphaeria primarily in usually having multiple ascomata per stroma, in
having noticeable stromatal tissue under the clypeus, and in having distinctly
longitudinally ribbed or pitted ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eight species are accepted here, including two formerly published
species --- R. hysterioides and R. scabrispora (Hóhn.) Aptroot, two new
species --- R. alveolata and R. intermedia, three new combinations --- R.
chilensis, R. donacicola, and R. pustulans, and one unnamed species.
They appear to form a coherent group, highly similar in most characteristics
but mainly differentiated from one another by ascospore characters. Among
the other published epithets of Roussoella, R. nitidula Sacc. & Paoletti and
R. verruculosa Cand. & Katumoto are considered to be synonyms of R.
hysterioides and R. donacicola, respectively. Roussoella minutella
(Penz. & Sacc.) Aptroot and possibly R. phyllostachydis (Hino & Katumoto)
Hino & Katumoto are synonyms of R. pustulans. Roussoella amphigena
Rick, R. bauhiniae (G. Wint.) Hóhn., R. munkii Speg., and R. subcoccodes
Speg. were reported from leaves. Since Roussoella is highly associated with
bamboo culms, these leaf-inhabiting taxa probably are not Roussoella
species, but we have not examined the materials. All but R. amphigena
were synonymized with Pseudothis coccodes (Lév.) Theiss. & Syd. by
Muller and von Arx (1962). Roussoella bambusae (Pat.) Monod [=
Diaporthe bambusae Pat.] and R. serrulata (Ellis & G. Martin) Hyde &
Aptroot [= Didymosphaeria serrulata Ellis & G. Martin] have ascal apical
rings that blue in Melzer's iodine reagent and thus probably belong to the
Amphisphaeriaceae sensu lato. According to Hino and Katumoto (1955),
Roussoella hysterioides var. minuta (Hino & Katumoto) Hino & Katumoto
[= Didymosphaeria striatula var. minuta Hino & Katumoto] differs from the
typical variety in having smaller stromata. Aptroot (1995a) believed that this
variety is the same as R. serrulata. We reserve judgement on this synonymy#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidia are intriguing. They are smooth and more or less thin-walled
when they secede from the conidiogenous cell (Fig. 35B). An outer wall or
wall layer seems to proliferate, forming a loose jacket around the spore. The
outer jacket then appears to wrinkle and blister (Fig. 31 & 35B). Examination
by transmission electron microscopy shows that the outer wall is formed from
the inner wall, remaining attached to it in places and causing wrinkles and
blisters (Figs. 28-30). The mechanics of this process, including membrane
involvement, were not investigated. At the time of outer wall formation, the
inner wall becomes thickened and then appears to divide or otherwise throw
off the outer wall (Fig. 30). On some occasions a fractured jacket wall shows
the conidium within (Fig. 32). A matrix might at first fill the space between
the two walls but at maturity the region between them appears empty, i.e., we
visualize it as resembling a beef roast within a loose puffed pastry shell.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Aptroot (1995b) briefly noted that a Cytoplea Bizz. & Sacc. anamorph
was formed in a culture obtained from Candoussau 5395. Our cultures
derived from a duplicate of this collection and Candoussau 289 also have a
Cytoplea anamorph. Von Hóhnel (1924) described C. verrucispora Hóhn.
from Indonesia and considered it to be the conidial state of R. hysterioides.
He mentioned that C. verrucispora was found between ascomata in larger
stromata of Roussoella. We have seen three microscope slides of von
Hóhnel's material INDONESIA: Java, Tjibodas, 1908 (FH, HOLOTYPE of
Cytoplea verrucispora)}. The anamorph that we found in culture in general
agrees with von Hóhnel's protologue and slides except for our conidia being
smaller, i.e., 8-11 x 5-6.5 µm vs. 12-15 x 6.5-8 µm. Substrates may have
caused variations in conidial size. The conidia that we measured are from
pure culture, whereas those that von Hóhnel measured are from the natural
substrate. Another possible explanation involves von Hóhnel's interpretation
of R. hysterioides. We have studied some Indonesian specimens identified
by von Hóhnel from FH. Two different Roussoella were found: Roussoella
alveolata and R. hysterioides. Thus, it is possible that C. verrucispora is
not the anamorph of R. hysterioides.#Misc-exposition*]

phyllostachydis. The former was recently combined with Roussoella by
Aptroot (1995a). The descriptions and illustrations in Penzig and Saccardo

of R. pustulans. Hino and Katumoto (1956) did not mention ornamentation
on the ascospores of D. phyllostachydis. Candoussau and Katumoto (in
Candoussau et al., 1985), while describing R. verruculosa, remarked that
this species can be distinguished from the “closely related R.
phyllostachydis’ partly by its smaller ascospores. According to this clue and
the illustrations that Hino and Katumoto (1956) made, we agree with Aptroot
(1995a) in suspecting R. phyllostachydis to be a synonym of R. minutella
and subsequently of R. pustulans. Unfortunately, we did not receive a

considered to be an Anthostomella Sacc., i.e., with ascospores, (11-)

on one end. He considered those specimens bearing the name S.
anserina at the Persoon herbarium at L to be misidentified. He then
selected a specimen at FH as the neotype. It is arguable whether or not
this neotypification is justified owing to the fact that Persoon's authentic
specimens are extant at L. If one accepts Rappaz's proposal,
Phaeosperma (Sacc.) Traverso will become a synonym of

diam; surface whitish to grayish, becoming dull grayish brown with age;
interior with soft, white tissue distributed around ostiole and with the
space between ascomata occupied by the host tissue. Ascomata
spherical, 0.2 mm diam, solitary or aggregated with a valsoid to
diatrypoid configuration. Ostioles short, barely raised. Asci clavate, with
eight ascospores arranged in partially biseriate manner, 100-125 x 12-17
µm, the spore-bearing part 45-70 µm, with ectotunica frequently broken at
stipe. Ascospores brown, two-celled, short-fusoid, constricted at septum,
15-20 x 5.5-8 µm, with a very fine dash-line-like ornamentation.
Hamathecia trabeculate, interlinked, hyaline, 1-1.5 µm broad.
This fungus belongs to the Melanommatales Barr. Its long-stipitate,
clavate asci are reminiscent of those of Hypsostroma Huhndorf

[@ABSTRACT#Misc-exposition*]

[@Xylaria entosulphurea, a taxon with gross features of Podosordaria
and a Geniculosporium-like anamorph, is described as new. Entonaema
globosum, originally described from Mexican material, is neotypified.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Key words: Entonaema, Geniculosporium, Podosordaria, Xylaria#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of us (FSM) collected a xylariaceous fungus from decaying wood
and the roots of Eugenia capuli (Schl. & Cham.) Berg. The fungus
resembles a Podosordaria Ellis & Holw. and, indeed, we suspected it to be
of that genus. The anamorph, however, is of the Xylaria type (Rogers, 1985;
Rogers et al., 1992; Rogers and Laess@e, 1992) and it is thus described as a
Xylaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After 6 wk on OMA white, dark-stipitate stromata 1-2 mm high x less than

[@This fungus looks much like a Podosordaria. Among described
Podosordaria species only P. hircina (Tai & Wei) Krug & Cain has
ascospores in the size range of our fungus (Krug & Cain, 1974; Krug & Jeng,
1995). Podosordaria hircina is known from goat dung in China. It seems to
differ morphologically from P. entosulphurea in lacking the striking yellow
interior. Unfortunately, P. hircina has not been cultured, as is the case for
most Podosordaria species. It is especially unfortunate that the type
species, P. mexicana Ellis & Holw., has not been cultured. Species of
Podosordaria that have been cultured have an anamorph assignable to
Lindquistia Subram. & Chandrashekara, a hyphomycetous genus with
disarticulating conidiogenous elements (Rogers, 1985; Rogers and Laessee,
1992). Poronia Willd.: Fr. species have anamorphs also assignable to
Lindquistia and, indeed, a case could be made for expanding the
delimitation of this genus to include Podosordaria. Such a decision awaits
the culturing of additional Podosordaria taxa. It is our strong opinion that
anamorphic data will be indispensable in the ultimate assignment of taxa to
Podosordaria and Poronia or to Xylaria (see also Rogers and Laessee,
1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The anamorphic synnemata produced in culture, following the
terminology of Seifert and Okada (1990), can be considered as indeterminate
because the structure continues to grow after sporulation begins; the hyphal
system is monomitic; the sporulating zone is divergent (loose) to apparently
random. The putative teleomorphic synnemata from culture seem somewhat
more differentiated in possessing distinctive stipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(published as E. globosa. Orthographic correction published in Index of
Fungi 3 (3): 42. 1961.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a treatment of Entonaema A. Moller, E. globosum was considered a
taxon of uncertain position because the type material is immature (Rogers,
1981). Moreover, type material of forma aurantia Heim, said to differ from
the typical form in having citron-orange to deep-orange stromata (Heim,
1960), also is immature (Rogers, 1981). Rogers (1981) speculated that E.
globosum is probably synonymous with E. cinnabarina (Cooke & Massee)
C. G. Lloyd. However, we now believe E. globosum to be a distinct species
with somewhat smaller ascospores and a brighter color than E. cinnabarina.#Diagnosis*]
[@Entonaema cinnabarina has orange granules beneath the surface, whereas
E. globosum has blood-red granules. Interestingly, both Entonaema
globosum and forma aurantia were described from near Rio Santiago,
Oaxaca, Mexico during the same time period. We suspect that Heim was
dealing with a single species ranging in color from yellow tinged with red (the
typical form) to quite orange (forma aurantia). One of us (FSM) collected an
Entonaema from Campeche state, Mexico that has the characteristics of E.
globosum in the broad sense of embracing both the typical forma and forma
aurantia. We here redescribe E. globosum assuming a single typical forma
and neotypify it. We feel particularly justified in that the proposed neotype is
from Mexico.#Diagnosis*]

0.7-1.5 cm high, externally vivid yellow to light orange with a blood-red layer
immediately beneath the surface, internally at first filled with a gelatinous
grayish liquid then becoming hollow with grayish white, horny internal walls.
Texture hard. Surface smooth or very wrinkled, pruinose, with discrete
cracking. Perithecia 0.1-0.3 mm diam. Ostioles umbilicate. Asci cylindrical,
8-spored, very long-stipitate, 136-191 µm total length x 9-8 µm broad, the

[@A review of a reprint edition could be concise and
relatively uninformative: numbers of pages, quality of
reproduction, strength of binding and the like. In this three-
volume set, quality of reproduction is excellent, especially
considering that text material was sometimes not totally clear
in its original form. Paper quality good; slightly cream-
colored so as to be kind to the eyes. Binding more than
adequate, and attractive. All in all, a fine job delivered with
respect as a commemoration of the 200th anniversary of Fries's
birth (August 15, 1794).#Misc-exposition*]

[@But all this said, the more interesting story by far is the
context in which these prodigious works were originally
produced. They were not, after all, Fries's only publications—
neither his first nor his last. They were written within the
context of his life-course and of history in general.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smaland was at the other end of Sweden from Stockholm,
and Femsjo, Fries'’s birthplace, was a bucolic hamlet. That
France was in the throes of revolution, with heads rolling,
could have only elicited head-shaking, if communication of
the day brought such information to such a place at all.  Elias's
father was the town vicar whose influence must have been
heavy on the young boy. After all, Latin, not Swedish, was the
lingua franca between father and son, and the father's love of
and interest in natural history rubbed off early on Elias. By
the time the boy entered secondary school in 1803 (age nine),
he was taking daily botanical excursions, and by 1811 he knew
the names of all flowering plants and 3-400 fungi. What can
be said of a boy whose hobby and passion was collecting and
mounting plant specimens, and using Linnaeus's Species
Plantarum and Systema Naturae to identify them?#Misc-exposition*]
[@500#Page-header*]

[@But Fries was also precocious in his willingness to share
his knowledge. After three years of work, he published a flora
of Vaxjo County in 1809 (age 15), and a year later a companion
piece on Femsjo (age 16). These were followed by a series of
locally distributed broadsides on local natural history. During
a trip to Copenhagen in 1812 (age almost 18) he complained
that there was no time to collect plants, for attractive but
worthless sight-seeing consumed his days. Only 500-600
specimens had been gathered!#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fungi and lichens assumed a growing importance in
Elias's life, largely, we are told, because he already knew the
green plants so well. His first major publication on fungi,
Observationes Mgycologici, in two volumes (1815, the same
year in which Napoleon's army was defeated at Waterloo, and
1818) were in the continuum of his prolific publication
schedule. A measure of his mastery of the subject: in the
Observationes he used 896 names to represent taxa lower
than genus, of which he coined or revised over 40%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Permeating all intellectual thought of the day was
Naturphilosophie, the German Romantic construct championed
by Wolfgang Goethe, among others. This construct was
idealistic—the basic scheme was inductive, not deductive, and so
science was bound to suffer. Fries was part of the movement,
and especially his Systema and Elenchus reflect this
imposed schema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries excelled in his studies at the University at Lund.
He was awarded a master's degree in 1811, and in November,
1814, he obtained his doctorate and was appointed as docent in
the same university. In this span of years the War of 1812 was
fought between England and the fledgling United States. It was
during these years that Fries annually visited Copenhagen and
there became friends with J. W. Hornemann, editor of the
famous Flora Danica, who later helped Fries to publish the
Observationes. Fries was becoming well-connected as well as
prodigious. Publications on local botanical finds and practical
scientific subjects followed from Lund.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Using only the limited literature available in the
Copenhagen and Lund libraries (notably Persoon's Synopsis,
and Albertini and Schweinitz's Conspectus), Fries soon
realized that the reason why fungi could not be identified (as
vascular plants could) was that they were not accurately
described, either in characters or numbers. This shortfall
must be corrected, and the result of careful personal collecting
and documentation was his Systema Mycologicum (volume
1, officially 1821, but quite likely 1820, age 26, while Beethoven
was composing his ninth symphony; volume 2 a year later)
which was compiled and written in Lund. His reputation grew,
as did his rank, additional publications appeared, he married,#Misc-exposition*]
[@501#Page-header*]

[@and a family was begun, even as he lectured and traveled to
Copenhagen. Recognizing that many higher fungi had been
overlooked in Systema volume one, he compiled his latest
notes into Elenchus Fungorum (1828; age 34). He could no
longer be considered a child prodigy—he was a maturing
scientist. Volume three of Systema appeared in 1832 (age 38).
In 1834, he was offered, and accepted, the chair in botany at
the University of Uppsala, to which he is most often linked.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Interestingly, in Systema and Elenchus, Fries
accepted (today we would use the term "sanctioned") only about
55% of the names he used in the Observationes, but did not
accept the other 45%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As time passed in Uppsala, where the forest flora
differed markedly from that of Smaland, as did the fungi, small
publications were issued and perhaps more significantly,
students wished to defend theses and dissertations. As was
usual at that time, the professor wrote the thesis and the
student defended it. Thus at least a dozen such documents were
compiled, each adding to Fries's insight into particular fungal
groups and forcing him to investigate separating characters
and more accurately distinguish taxa. He was led to accept
more numerous, smaller, more accurately delineated genera
(we would call them "split genera"), so that by the 1830s, much
more knowledge about the fungi had been uncovered, both
from new literature and from personal observations. This was
the context in which Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici was
compiled for publication in two volumes in 1836 and 1838 (age
42, 44).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries Observationes were the publications of an
upstart, albeit remarkable for their time. Systema and
Elenchus were more mature, although still under the spell of
Romanticism. Finally, Epicrisis is the work of a mature
scientist—concise, wide-ranging. It could be argued that these
major compilations, of which the Observationes, Systema,
and Elenchus have been sumptuously reprinted by the
Gruppo Bresadola, were Fries's best contributions. Their
centerpieces, Systema and Elenchus, of course, were singled
out by mycologists early in the 20th century to serve as
"starting points" for fungus nomenclature (along with
Persoon's Synopsis), and in spite of extensive tinkering over
the years, they still occupy a hallowed place in mycological
literature. This reprint edition again offers all mycologists an
Opportunity to own these seminal works.#Misc-exposition*]

it is very welcome that Introductory Mycology, Fourth
Edition has just been released. This new edition continues in
the taxonomic tradition of its predecessor, but it incorporates
insights from the last sixteen years of research in all fields of
mycology, especially systematics.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A comparison of the opening chapters of the third and
fourth editions illustrates the changes in mycology that have
occurred since 1979. In the third edition, the first chapter (43
pp) covered the practical importance of fungi, general
characteristics of fungi, and fungal classification. The new
edition devotes three separate chapters (85 pp) to these
subjects. The entire first chapter is dedicated to the practical
and cultural significance of fungi for humans. Giving these
issues so much space was wise. Most students in mycology
courses will not go on to become mycologists, but if we can
convince them of the importance of fungi in their lives, then
our science, and society in general, will benefit. The second
chapter covers general characteristics of fungi. Here the
recent advances in understanding of cell biology, hyphal
growth, spore production, and other basic attributes of fungi
are evident. The third chapter of the fourth edition covers
higher-level fungal systematics (the third edition gave only
eight pages to this topic). The dramatic progress of the last
sixteen years is immediately apparent: whereas the third
edition began its discussion of fungal systematics by saying,
"The classification of the fungi presents innumerable
difficulties with which you as a beginning student need not be#Misc-exposition*]
[@504#Page-header*]

[@confronted," the fourth edition opens this chapter with a
cladogram of the fungi (and non-fungi) based on phylogenetic
analysis of 18S ribosomal DNA sequences. In addition to a
phylogenetically-based overview of fungi, Chapter three of
the new edition also includes a brief review of phylogenetic
systematics, paleomycology, and botanical nomenclature.
Chapters 1-3 of the new edition can stand on their own as an
introduction to fungal biology and biodiversity. They would
make an excellent reading assignment for the mycology
section of a general course on the diversity of life.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chapters 4-29 describe in detail the various groups of
fungi. Our understanding of fungal phylogeny is still far from
complete, and so some chapters treat groups that are
acknowledged to be polyphyletic, such as the deuteromycetes
(Chapter 8) or the gasteromycetes (Chapter 18).  Chytrids and
zygomycetes receive three chapters between them.
Basidiomycetes and ascomycetes receive nine and seven
chapters, respectively. Introductory chapters to the
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes provide useful overviews of
these groups, including cladograms that show proposed
relationships of the major subdivisions. By referring back to
the more general cladograms in Chapter three, it should be
easy for students to comprehend the hierarchical
relationships of the major groups of fungi. Organisms
traditionally treated as fungi, but not in the monophyletic
Kingdom Fungi are treated in the final seven chapters. The
book is amply illustrated with light and electron micrographs,
photographs, drawings, and life-cycle diagrams. The
reference lists following each chapter add up to a massive
literature review. There are separate subject and author
indexes, as well as a glossary to mycological terms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This textbook is ideal for mycology courses that are
oriented along taxonomic lines. In the Preface, the authors
suggest that the index can be used to seek out topics such as
"plant pathogens" or "medically important fungi," but courses
that strongly emphasize such topics may find this book too
limited. Nevertheless, this is an essential reference for all
serious students of mycology, including industrial and medical
mycologists. There is no other single source that reviews the
current knowledge in fungal systematics with such breadth
and depth. Given its price and density, it may not be
appropriate to ask every undergraduate mycology student to
purchase this book, but at least one copy should be in every
mycology classroom. Considering how long it may be before a
fifth edition is published, it may be worth purchasing a set of
copies to keep on reserve or to lend out for a semester at a time.
