[@Abstract — Gasteroid fungi were collected during the course of ﬁeldwork in Pakistan.
Here, we report on two species, Bovistella japonica and Lycoperdon excipuliforme, from the
Himalayan moist temperate forest of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, each a new record
for the country. Phellorinia herculeana represents a new record from Cholistan Desert of the
Punjab Province. For each taxon reported, detailed macro- and microscopic descriptions are
presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The wide range of habitats in Pakistan that extends from coastal regions
along the Arabian Sea to arid scrubland in the Punjab region and to the high
altitude forests and tundra of the Himalayas supports a rich diversity of fungi.
One group, the gasteroid fungi, has been documented from the nation in
several publications (Long & Ahmad 1947, Ahmad 1952, Yoshimi & Hagiwara
1992, Khalid & Iqbal 1996, Ahmad et al. 1997, Sultan et al. 2001, Razzaq &
Shahzad 2004, 2007, Iqbal et al. 2006, Sultana et al. 2007, Moreno et al. 2009).
In total, 112 species representing approximately 30 genera have been reported
from Pakistan. Although a considerable number of taxa are known, it is likely
that the present accounting of Pakistani gasteroid fungi is far from complete,
as a large portion of the country has been sampled only in a cursory manner,
if at all.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In this study, we collected gasteroid fungi in two diﬀerent biomes of Pakistan
— the moist temperate forest of the Himalayas and scrubland of the Cholistan
Desert. The Himalayan moist temperate forest extends from the Murree Hills of
the Ayubia National Park to the Swat Valley (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province),
along the outer range of the Himalayas at an altitude of around 1850–2500 m
(Ahmad et al. 2006). The Cholistan Desert, which covers a 26,000 km2 area#Misc-exposition*]

[@262 ... Yousaf, Niazi & Khalid#Page-header*]
[@in southwest Punjab province, is among the hottest and driest regions in the
country (Akbar et al. 1996).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Here we report on three gasteroid species from Pakistan: Bovistella japonica
and Lycoperdon excipuliforme were collected in the Himalayan moist temperate
forest and represent new records for the country, while Phellorinia herculeana
(previously reported from Pakistan as P. inquinans) represents a new record for
the Cholistan Desert.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Observations of microscopic characters (e.g., spore dimensions, eucapillitium,
peridial hyphae) were made under a light microscope (at 1000× magniﬁcation) on
material mounted in lactophenol and 5% KOH medium. Glebal color and macroscopic
peridial features were observed using Meiji stereomicroscope, and illustrations were
made with the help of a camera lucida.#Misc-exposition*]

[@of short, separate capillitial units, pedicellate spores, and sterile base. The
combination of Bovista-like capillitial units and Lycoperdon-like sterile base
places the species in the intermediate genus, Bovistella, along with B. ohiensis
(Ellis & Morgan) Morgan, B. radicata (Durieu & Mont.) Pat., B. lycoperdoides
(Schwein.) Lloyd, B. paludosa (Lév.) Pat., and B. ammophila (Lév.) Lloyd.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Among these taxa, B. japonica is more closely allied with B. ohiensis and
B. paludosa, which also share the same general spore dimensions (~4–5 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: Commonly called the “pestle puffball,” L. excipuliforme usually
fruits in groups from summer to autumn in coniferous and deciduous
woodlands (Jordan 2006). It is characterized by large basidiomes consisting
of an upper spore case and long pseudostipe and by the presence of slit-like
pores in its capillitial threads. Lycoperdon perlatum Pers., which also develops
the same reticulate pattern over the endoperidial surface as the larger verrucae
slough oﬀ, diﬀers in its smaller stature and the absence of a well-developed
elongated pseudostipe. Lycoperdon excipuliforme is new to the mycoﬂora of
Pakistan.#Misc-exposition*]
