[@Abstract — Examination of the isotype of a Coltricia species described from India conﬁrms
it as a good morphological species. A new name, Coltricia indica, is proposed to replace its
two previous illegitimate names. The species is characterized by very small, centrally stipitate
basidiomes with shiny pilei when dried, lobed to serrate and ciliate margins, and oblongellipsoid, more or less thick-walled basidiospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sharma & Wright (1992) described a new species Coltricia pusilla based
on two collections of a small polypore found in two forests in Khasi Hills,
Meghalaya State, India. However, their binomial was a later homonym of a
name previously used by Imazeki & Kobayashi (1966) for a new species from
Japan.#Misc-exposition*]
[@When J.E. Wright later became aware of Imazeki & Kobayashi’s work, he
proposed Coltricia parvula as a nom. nov. for the Indian species (Wright 1997).
Unfortunately, this was also a later homonym of a combination previously
published by Murrill (1904).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Our goal was to conﬁrm the identity of Sharma & Wright’s species and
provide a legitimate name for it.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The isotype of Coltricia pusilla J.R. Sharma & J.E. Wright was studied during a visit
of the senior author to BAFC. Basidiomes were cut by hand for microscopic study,
and sections were mounted in 3% KOH, water and Melzer’s reagent (IKI). Herbaria
acronyms follow Thiers (2011).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Original description (from Sharma & Wright 1992 with our additions within
square brackets) — “Fruitbody annual, centrally stipitate, coriaceous soft
when fresh, hard and rigid on drying. Pileus infundibuliform or depressed at
centre, circular, 5–8 mm diam., 1–1.5 mm thick, ﬁnely depressed velutinate [to
glabrous when dry], deep golden brown to cinnamon brown, shiny to glossy,
narrowly concentrically zonate. Margin sharp, deﬂexed when dry, ciliate [lobed
to serrate]. Pore surface rusty brown, with a narrow sterile margin. Pores
angular, 2–4 [2–3] per mm, entire, becoming uneven near stipe with age. Tubes
≤ 1 mm deep, light golden brown to ochraceous brown. Context ≤ 0.5 mm
thick, rusty brown, ﬁbrous. Stipe equal or tapering upwards, usually swollen
at base, ≤ 2 cm × 1–1.5 mm, ﬁnely tomentose to more velutinate towards base,
light rusty brown to dark brown [with a soft, loose discoid or globose base
enclosing some substrate].#Description*]
[@“Hyphal system monomitic, generative hyphae with simple septa, branched
at broad [acute] angles, golden brown, 4–7 μm wide. Spores oblong-ellipsoid

slightly [to distinctly] thick-walled, [with a distinct apiculus,] golden brown
[in KOH, lighter in water], inamyloid, [nondextrinoid,] 5–6 × 3–4.2 μm [(5–)

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coltricia indica is characterized by its very small, centrally stipitate
basidiomes and a circular infundibuliform pileus with a lobed to serrated and
ciliate margin. The stipe base is also noteworthy in that the isotype basidiomes
have enlarged bases with soft and loose tissue enclosing a piece of substrate or
forming a discus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@This species is very similar to C. minor Y.C. Dai, which also has very small
basidiomes (< 0.5 cm long) and basidiospores almost identical in shape and#Misc-exposition*]

[@size. However, they diﬀer both macroscopically and ecologically. Coltricia
minor has laterally stipitate basidiomes, fan-shaped to spathulate pilei, nonciliate margins, and regular stipe bases. Furthermore, C. minor was collected on
angiosperm wood and is thus far known only from Hunan Province (China),
which has a subtropical climate. Coltricia indica, on the other hand, was found
growing on the ground of coniferous forests in India in a temperate climate due
the altitude (Sharma & Wright 1992, Dai et al. 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Coltricia barbata Ryvarden & de Meijer and C. velutina Baltazar & Gibertoni,
known from Brazilian Atlantic Forest areas, also have ciliate margins and
small basidiomes — pilei measuring ≤ 1.8 cm and ≤ 2.8 cm diam., respectively
(Meijer 2006, Baltazar et al. 2010). However, C. barbata has basidiospores#Misc-exposition*]

[@388 ... Baltazar & Silveira#Page-header*]
[@that are globose to subglobose and 5–6 × 5–6 μm, compared to subglobose to
broadly ellipsoid and 5.5–6.5(–7) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) μm in C. velutina. Both
species also have smaller pores: 4–9 per mm in C. barbata and (4–)5–7 per mm
in C. velutina.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Within Hymenochaetaceae Imazeki & Toki, stipitate poroid representatives
with smooth basidiospores have been placed mainly in Coltricia Gray or
Phylloporia Murrill. Traditionally Phylloporia species have a duplex pileal
context with a black line below the tomentum, while Coltricia species have a
homogeneous context and usually larger basidiospores. Ecological aspects
were considered important but not decisive in circumscribing the two genera.
However, recent studies have shown that some Coltricia species [including the
type, Coltricia perennis (L.) Murrill] establish ectomycorrhizal associations
(Tedersoo et al. 2007). Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis by Valenzuela et al.
(2011) supports Coltricia stuckertiana (Speg.) Rajchenb. & J.E. Wright within
the Phylloporia clade. Except for its basidiospores, C. stuckertiana displays
all other features typical of Coltricia. On the other hand, the type species of
Phylloporia (P. parasitica Murrill) has not yet been included in any phylogenetic
analysis. Its placement within the hymenochaetoid clade is needed for a reliable
classiﬁcation of the two genera, particularly as P. parasitica occurs in a very
specialized substrate, i.e., living angiosperm leaves.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Perhaps Coltricia will eventually be restricted to ectomycorrhizal species. If
so, we will only know the ectomycorrhizal status of C. indica by ﬁnding more
specimens. For the time being we retain the species in Coltricia based on its
morphology.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on its ornamented basidiospores, Coltricia pusilla Imazeki & Kobayashi
is currently treated as Coltriciella pusilla (Imazeki & Kobayashi) Corner (Corner
1991) [≡ Coltriciella pusilla (Imazeki & Kobayashi) J.E. Wright, comb. superﬂ.].
Coltricia parvula (Klotzsch) Murrill is accepted as a heterotypic synonym of
Coltricia cinnamomea (Jacq.) Murrill (Murrill 1908, Ryvarden 1976).#Misc-exposition*]
