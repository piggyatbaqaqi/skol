[@Abstract – A new species, Phlebopus spongiosus, is described with a peculiar sponge-like
tissue in which the hollow spaces in the tubes are ﬁlled in by pleurocystidia-like elements, and
a thin membrane of dissepiments encloses the immature pores. It occurs in citrus orchards
(Citrus maxima) in southern Vietnam.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Heim (1936) proposed Phlebopus as a subgenus of Boletus to accommodate
Boletus colossus R. Heim. Singer (1936) elevated Phlebopus to genus with
P. colossus (R. Heim) Singer as type species. Subsequently, Heinemann &
Rammeloo (1982), Singer et al. (1983), and Singer (1986) emended the generic
limits to encompass all taxa of Phaeogyroporus (Singer 1944). With 12 species
(Kirk et al. 2008: 522), Phlebopus was classiﬁed in the Boletinellaceae (Boletales)
by Binder & Bresinsky (2002).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most distinctive features of Phlebopus spongiosus are the spongelike tissue composed of numerous fusoid-ventricose to ventricose-rostrate
pleurocystidioid elements, the subcylindrical to subclavate dissepiments#Misc-exposition*]

[@32 ... Pham & al.#Page-header*]
[@forming a thin membrane that covers the immature pores, and the dark-brown
spore print not found in any other known Phlebopus species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although its dark brown spore print appears foreign to Phlebopus sensu
Singer (1986), the shortly ellipsoid smooth basidiospores and clamp connections
merit placing P. spongiosus within Phlebopus (Singer 1986).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Its medium to large dark yellowish-brown boletoid basidioma bears a
superﬁcial resemblance to the Southeast Asian P. portentosus (Boedijn 1951,
Heinemann & Rammeloo 1982, Singer et al. 1983) and P. marginatus originally
described from Australia (Watling & Gregory 1988, Grgurinovic 1997). Both
taxa diﬀer from P. spongiosus in their olivaceous brown spore print and lack of
distinct hymenial cystidia (Boedijn 1951; Pegler 1986; Watling & Li 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@It should be noted that P. spongiosus basidiomata are sometimes accompanied
by a crust-like mycelial structure around nearby citrus tree roots reminiscent
of “crypta” as deﬁned by Singer (“sleeve-like formations around tree roots in
tropical and subtropical conditions;” 1986: 10). Further critical investigations,
including cultural and molecular studies, are needed to conﬁrm its relationship
with P. spongiosus basidiomata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The crypta-like mycelium of P. spongiosus is comparable to that of three
neotropical taxa: P. tropicus (Rick) Heinem. & Rammeloo (Singer 1944, Singer
& Digilio 1957, Heinemann & Rammeloo 1982, Singer et al. 1983), P. beniensis
(Singer & Digilio) Heinem. & Rammeloo (Heinemann & Rammeloo 1982,
Singer et al. 1983), and P. brasiliensis Singer (Singer et al. 1983). Those taxa
diﬀer from P. spongiosus mainly by lacking distinct hymenial cystidia and having
olivaceous-brown spore print. Moreover, according to the Phlebopus key by
Singer et al. (1983), the wide pores (≥1 mm diam.) or boletinoid/subgyrose
hymenophore separate P. tropicus from P. spongiosus. Miller et al. (2000) noted
that Puerto Rican P. beniensis specimens had well-developed cheilocystidia but
provided no information regarding the presence or absence of pleurocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phlebopus spongiosus also shares well developed fusoid-ventricose to
ventricose-rostrate pleurocystidia-like elements with P. cystidiosus Heinem &
Rammeloo from Ethiopia (Heinemann & Rammeloo 1982). However, the lack
of clamp connections causes P. cystidiosus to seem out of place in Phlebopus.
Its glabrous non-reticulate stipe, ellipsoid basidiospores, and absence of clamp
connections make P. cystidiosus seem more closely related to Rubinoboletus
Pilát & Dermek (Heinemann & Rammeloo 1983, Watling & Gregory 1988, Li
& Watling 1999, Watling & Li 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The thin membrane enclosing the immature pores might also suggest a
relationship between P. spongiosus and the secotioid boletes (Thiers 1984).
However, the secotioid boletes are generally associated with an often misshapen
pileus, irregularly oriented tubes, and a typically less-developed stipe, characters
not seen in P. spongiosus.#Misc-exposition*]
