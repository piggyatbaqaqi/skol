[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lecanora expallens is a well known, common and widely distributed
sorediate lichen species, reported from many regions of the world (e.g. Tønsberg
1992, Pišút et al. 1996, Motiejūnaitė 1999, Diederich & Sérusiaux 2000, Śliwa
& Wetmore 2000, Hafellner & Türk 2001, Coppins 2002, Fałtynowicz 2003,
Kurokawa 2003, Aptroot et al. 2004, Ryan et al. 2004, Santesson et al. 2004,
Galloway 2007). It was included in the taxonomical revision of the Lecanora
varia group in North America (Śliwa & Wetmore 2000) and in the recent lichen
ﬂora of the Greater Sonoran Desert Region (Ryan et al. 2004) as well. The
species was also discussed by Printzen (2001) in relation to L. confusa Almb.,
a taxon which is supposed to be an esorediate counterpart of L. expallens and
considered by some authors as doubtfully distinct from the latter (see Śliwa &
Wetmore 2000).#Misc-exposition*]
[@During my research on sorediate crustose lichens, several sterile and fertile
specimens of L. expallens were investigated. After the examination of all
available literature it became clear that although L. expallens was a common
subject of several studies, no type specimen of the species has ever been cited
and actually the identity of the species has remained obscure. That prompted
the examination of the type collections of L. expallens, including L. expallens
var. conizaea. The aim of this paper is to present the typiﬁcation of L. expallens
and L. expallens var. conizaea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Type material from BM-ACH and H-ACH was studied, with additional specimens
from BM, KRAM and UGDA examined for comparison. Lichen substances were studied
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in solvents A and C according to the methods of
Culberson & Kristinsson (1970) and Orange et al. (2001).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thallus crustose, grey green, episubstratal, entirely sorediate, without
any delimited soralia (marginal part not preserved in the collected specimen);
soredia farinose; apothecia lecanorine, sessile, ﬂat to slightly convex,
numerous; disc brown, delicately pruinose, pruina farinose; thalline margin
well developed, persistent, raised above the disc, sorediate, concolorous
with the thallus, cortex not seen; amphithecium with two diﬀerent types of
crystals, one present in the outer part, yellowish in polarized light, K soluble
and N insoluble, the other in the inner part, more whitish in polarized light,
K insoluble and N soluble; parathecium well visible, up to 40 μm wide,
with substance (amorphic?) yellow in polarized light, K soluble, N insoluble;
epithecium brownish, granulose, granules coarse, yellow in polarized light,
K soluble and N mostly insoluble (or slowly soluble); paraphyses simple, up to
2 μm wide, not capitate; ascospores 8 in ascus, non-septate, hyaline, narrowly
(9–14 × 4–5 μm) or broadly (11 × 6–6.5 μm) ellipsoid.#Description*]
[@Chemistry — Usnic acid (+), zeorin (+), thiophanic acid (+), xanthone
similar to arthothelin (+), ‘expallens unknown’ sensu Tønsberg (1992) and
trace of unidentiﬁed xanthone (±, both only in the lectotype of L. expallens
var. conizaea) were detected in the studied type specimens. That agrees with
the chemistry reported by Tønsberg (1992), Śliwa & Wetmore (2000), Printzen
(2001) and Ryan et al. (2004).#Description*]
[@Comments — According to Kärnefelt & Thell (2007), the main part of Acharius
collection is placed at the University of Helsinki as H-ACH. Less comprehensive
(but still large) collections are also present in the Museum of Evolution in
Uppsala (UPS-ACH), the Natural History Museum in Stockholm (S), and the
Natural History Museum, London (BM-ACH) (see also Vondrák & Vitikainen
2008). Specimens of L. expallens were found only in H and BM.
The collection in H-ACH contains ﬁve specimens, all associated at least
with the country name and some also with further information. Two of them#Misc-exposition*]

[@correspond to the protologue in Acharius (1810), therefore the collection in
H-ACH is suitable for the typiﬁcation. In BM-Ach the specimen consists of
several pieces of wood covered with thallus of L. expallens, but no details of
locality and collector are provided.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Acharius (1810) cited ‘Habitat ad truncos Salicinos Galliae. Du Four.
Persoon.’ Both those collections are present in H-ACH; however, only Du
Four’s specimen belongs to L. expallens in the currently accepted sense, and
that one is selected in this paper as a lectotype to preserve the current concept
of the species. The second specimen represents Pertusaria coccodes (Ach.) Nyl.
(norstictic and connorstictic acids were detected by TLC). Both specimens
have also been examined and annotated by O. Almborn in 1963, but his results
have never been published (O. Vitikainen, pers. information).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Acharius (1810) cited three specimens of L. expallens var. conizaea: ‘Habitat
in cortice Pini ac ligno Quercus vetusto Angliae, Turner; Helvetiae, Schleicher.’
In H-ACH only one specimen annotated as L. expallens var. conizaea exists; it
is on piece of bark of pine from ‘Anglia’ and is here selected as lectotype. This
name (as L. conizaea) was often misapplied for L. conizaeoides Nyl. ex Cromb.
and L. strobilina (Spreng.) Kieﬀ. (Laundon 1976, 2003). However, as the type
corresponds morphologically and chemically with the lectotype of L. expallens,
L. expallens var. conizaea is conﬁrmed as a synonym of L. expallens, which was
already mentioned by Laundon (2003).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr Christian Printzen (Frankfurt am Main) and Dr Lucyna Śliwa (Kraków) are
warmly thanked for peer-reviewing the paper. I am also very grateful to Dr Orvo
Vitikainen (Helsinki) for making the type collection available for the study, suggestions
how to present the results and the discussion on the typiﬁcation, Dr Scott LaGreca
(formerly London) and Dr Anders Nordin (Uppsala) for the hospitality during the visits
to BM and UPS. This work was supported by the SYNTHESYS grant GB-TAF-1013.#Misc-exposition*]
