[@Abstract —Endophragmiella gardeniae sp. nov., on dead branches of Gardenia hainanensis,
and E. machili sp. nov., on dead branches of Machilus grijsii, are described and illustrated.
They diﬀer from other described Endophragmiella species in their obclavate or fusiform
conidia with branches that developed a Selenosporella-like synanamorph. The specimens are
deposited in Herbarium of Shandong Agricultural University, Plant Pathology (HSAUP) and

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sutton (1973) established Endophragmiella for two species, E. pallescens
B. Sutton (the type species) and E. canadensis (Ellis & Everh.) B. Sutton.
Subsequently, the genus was emended by Hughes (1979), who gave a very
detailed account of conidiogenesis and generic concepts. Endophragmiella is
characterized by monoblastic, integrated, terminal, determinate or percurrently
extending conidiogenous cells on distinct, branched or unbranched
conidiophores, and solitary, acrogenous, septate conidia with rhexolytic
conidial secession. To date, 79 species and one variety have been recognized
within the genus, all from temperate to tropical areas (Wu & Zhang 2005,
Chen et al. 2008, Brackel & Markovskaja 2009, Castañeda Ruiz et al. 2010,
Leão-Ferreira & Gusmão 2010). The species are diﬀerentiated primarily by
conidial shape, size, septation, pigmentation, ornamentation, and presence or
absence of a rostrum (Sutton 1973, Hughes 1979, Wu & Zhuang 2005).
During ongoing surveys of saprobic microfungi from forests of
southern China, two interesting anamorphic species were collected from
dead branches. The characters of their conidia and conidiogenesis suggest#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Endophragmiella gardeniae and E. machili are unlike the taxa hitherto
placed in Endophragmiella in that their conidia have branches that develop a
Selenosporella-like synanamorph. The initial thought was to introduce a new
genus to accommodate these two species. However, Drs. Heredia and Arias
showed us pictures of an Endophragmiella sp. (on decaying wood, Mexico,
Veracruz, Acajete Municipal, Mesa de la Yerba, 19°33ʹN 97°01ʹW, 5 Dec. 2010,
coll. G. Heredia & R.M. Arias) with many states of conidial development that
are clearly the same as these two species. Therefore, we place them as new
species in the genus Endophragmiella.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Endophragmiella gardeniae and E. machili bear some resemblance to E. socia
(M.B. Ellis) S. Hughes (Hughes 1979) and E. fagicola P.M. Kirk (Kirk 1981)
in conidial shape. However, the conidia of E. machili are longer and narrower
than those of either E. socia (36–50 × 10.8–15.3 μm, 6–11-septate, usually 7) or
E. fagicola (70–90 × 11–17 μm, usually 5-septate). Endophragmiella gardeniae
also diﬀers in conidial size and septation from E. socia and E. fagicola. In
addition, E. gardeniae and E. machili produce conidia with branches that
developed a Selenosporella-like synanamorph, a feature not found in E. socia
and E. fagicola. Endophragmiella gardeniae diﬀers from E. machili in its shorter
conidia with fewer septa.#Misc-exposition*]
