[@Abstract — A neotype designation for Helvella fusca proposed in 1997 proves to have been
erroneous because an illustration accompanying the original description was overlooked. Such
illustrations normally have served as the lectotype when all known specimens of the author’s
taxon have been lost. The authors of that neotype designation should instead have designated
the illustration as a lectotype and a specimen as an epitype, which is done in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The so-called neotype specimen is now selected as the epitype specimen. A full description,
illustrations and remarks about synonyms and a non-synonym are also provided.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words — International Code of Botanical Nomenclature#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helvella fusca was described by Gillet (1879: 9), but unfortunately his description
did not specify any specimen or ﬁgure to represent that species, making
typiﬁcation more diﬃcult. Dissing (1966b) wrote about this species: “I have not
seen any authentic specimen of H. fusca Gillet, whereas the many Bresadolacollections of H. fusca in the herbarium in Stockholm (S) make it possible to
get a precise concept of Bresadola’s species.” With respect to the type specimen
of H. fusca, Dissing (1966b) wrote only, “not seen.” Later, in their seminal paper
on the northern and northwestern Helvellaceae of North America, Abbott &
Currah (1997) made a minor but (we believe) critical error by designating a
neotype specimen for H. fusca, even though that species does not occur in
North America. They overlooked the excellent illustration in Gillet’s paper
(pl. 4, not cited in the species description but referenced mistakenly in one plate
listing as pl. 14 and correctly in the other as pl. 4). They may have been unaware
that such an illustration, if one upon which it can be shown that the description#Misc-exposition*]

[@or diagnosis validating the name was based, is considered part of the original
material (McNeill et al. 2006: Vienna Code Art. 9 Note 2) and becomes eligible
as a lectotype (sometimes informally referred to an “iconotype”) of the species
name (Fig. 1). An interesting article by Ross (2002) brings into question
whether an illustration accompanying an original description is always part
of the original material and thus eligible as a lectotype when all specimens are
lost or missing. At the XVIII International Botanical Congress in 2011 one
proposal attempting to clarify such situations (Art. 9, Prop E (215); see McNeill
& Turland 2011, Perry 2010) regrettably was rejected by a card vote (McNeill
et al. 2011). We feel that this case should be corrected at a future Congress but
now proceed under the assumption that Gillet’s plate was drawn from living
specimens now lost and that the illustration is part of the original material that
can and should be designated as a lectotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helvella fusca, lecto- and epitypiﬁed ... 433#Misc-exposition*]

[@A neotype may only be proposed when all original material is lost [Vienna
Code]:#Misc-exposition*]
[@Art. 9.6. A neotype is a specimen or illustration selected to serve as nomenclatural
type if no original material is extant, or as long as it is missing.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Also pertinent is Art. 9.7:#Misc-exposition*]
[@An epitype is a specimen or illustration selected to serve as an interpretative type
when the holotype, lectotype, or previously designated neotype, or all original
material associated with a validly published name, is demonstrably ambiguous
and cannot be critically identiﬁed for purposes of the precise application of the
name of a taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The senior author pointed out this discrepancy to the junior author, and we
have chosen instead to propose as epitype the same specimen designated
as neotype by Abbott & Currah (1997) from the Bresadola collection in the
Naturhistorische Rijksmuseum in Stockholm, Norway —Al Deserto, [Italy],
collected by Bresadola, 05 21 1898 (Fig. 2). This specimen is also illustrated by
Dissing (1966b). Oddly, Abbott & Currah failed to cite (or were unaware of)
Bresadola’s careful description, which clearly cited Gillet’s ﬁgure and provided
a superb plate of his own collection (Bresadola 1900: 100, tab. CCXII) (Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]
[@That plate and description was reissued (Bresadola 1933: 1174, pl. 1174) with the
headers and footers of the plate in diﬀerent typeface and numbering and with
a number of emendations of the text —notably eliminating Bresadola’s 1900
acknowledgement that Boudier had informed him that specimens Bresadola
had sent to him were identical with Gillet’s species. The 1933 plate renders the
ﬁgures in paler colors throughout.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Since Gillet’s plate does not provide enough information for modern
identiﬁcation, an epitype is in order. The Code requires that if an illustration is
the only surviving element of the original material, that illustration should be
designated as a lectotype, which we do in this paper. The confused information
that already exists on the morphology of this species in the literature can
be resolved with an epitype specimen. Gillet (1879) described H. fusca with
spherical to subspherical ascospores, and he did not mention any other useful
microscopic character. Bresadola (1900) described ascospores as ellipsoidal,
18–20 × 12–13 µm (but he did not indicate whether those measurements
correspond to smooth or to verrucose ascospores), and a glabrous, sterile outer
surface of the apothecium. Dissing (1966b) mentioned ascospores 17–18.4–21
× 11–12–13 µm, with pustules when young, and the outside of the apothecium
naked or very delicately pubescent. The senior author studied Bresadola’s
specimen 05 21 1898 (now the epitype) and observed that smooth (young)
ascospores were larger, while verrucose (mature) were smaller (Fig. 5a) (see
species description), with the hyphal fascicles of the apothecium absent or ≤ 50
µm in length (Fig. 5b), corresponding to a glabrous to subpubescent surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Helvella fusca can be confused with H. lacunosa Afzel., because
both have lobed apothecia, a lacunose stipe, glabrous to subpubescent excipular
surface with the outer surface of the stipe similar, but H. fusca has a pale brown
hymenium and grows associated with Populus spp., while H. lacunosa has a
black or greyish hymenium and has a global distribution with no particular
association with Populus. Boudier (1904) ﬁrst introduced H. fusca var.
bresadolae as a nomen nudum for a plate he planned to issue later. As pointed
out by Korf (1986: 213, footnote; 1988: 213, footnote), Boudier (1907) soon after
abandoned the variety, citing his plate as merely H. fusca. Boudier (1910), who
eventually validly proposed H. fusca var. bresadolae (Fig. 4) based on apothecia#Misc-exposition*]

[@that Bresadola sent him (but unfortunately not cited in the description), wrote
“Hæc varietas typo simillima, diﬀert tantummodo pediculo non albido, sed
pileo concolore.” Boudier (1911) later expanded the description. Dissing
(1966a) considered this variety as invalid, because this specimen is possibly
part of the Bresadola material that he studied and determined as “in all details
identical.” We also do not recognize the variety, because Gillet did not describe
the stipe color only as white but as “dessous pâle, blanc sale ou lég[èremen]t.
fuligineux.” Furthermore, in Helvella stipe coloration varies too greatly within a
species to be considered useful for recognizing varieties. For example the stipe
of H. lacunosa can vary from whitish to grayish to black. Chenantais (Pelé &
Chenantais 1921) proposed H. fusca var. gyromitroides, but the features that
he used to recognize the variety (multilobed, fawn and free apothecial margin,
and lacunose and yellowish stipe) are within the range of variation of the
species. We do not consider H. fusca a synonym of H. sulcata α fusca, because
Afzelius recognized H. sulcata with “sulcis regularibus,” i.e., only longitudinal
ribs on stipe (Afzelius 1783, Tab. X, ﬁg.1; this ﬁgure is also in Dissing (1966b,
ﬁg. 27c), while H. fusca and H. lacunosa have longitudinal and transverse ribs
(lacunose stipe) [i.e., in the words of Afzelius: “lacunis sulcisque irregularibus”].#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA sequences support H. sulcata as a distinct species (unpublished data),
contrary to the opinions by Dissing (1966b) and Abbott & Currah (1997), who
considered it a synonym of H. lacunosa. Persoon (1801) described H. sulcata
α fusca with “pileo nigro.” Helvella fusca has more recently been reported from
Europe, North America, and Asia (Dissing 1966b, Ceccaldi 2006, Kempton &
Wells 1970; Kaushal 1991). Abbott & Currah (1997) doubted the existence of
H. fusca in North America because their study indicated that such reports were
probably H. maculata N.S. Weber. On the other hand, Kaushal (1991) recorded
H. fusca from the Himalayas, but as his description mentioned hyphal fascicles
of the apothecium measuring ≤ 105 µm long, it is unclear whether that report
corresponds to H. fusca. Based on the above information, we can say that its
distribution outside of Europe remains doubtful.#Misc-exposition*]
