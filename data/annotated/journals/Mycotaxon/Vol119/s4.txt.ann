[@Abstract — Four species of Sporidesmium were collected from decaying twigs in tropical
and subtropical forests in southern China. Sporidesmium liquidambaris sp. nov. on
Liquidambar formosana, S. antidesmatis sp. nov. on Antidesma ghaesembilla, and S. machili
sp. nov. on Machilus chinensis, are described, illustrated, and compared with closely related
taxa. Sporidesmium takashii is recorded as new for the Chinese mycota.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Sporidesmium (anamorphic Pleosporales) was established by
Link (1809) with S. atrum Link as type species. Ellis (1958, 1971) deﬁned the
genus as having integrated, terminal, monoblastic, determinate or percurrent
conidiogenous cells on distinctive, unbranched conidiophores, and acrogenous,
solitary, transversely septate or distoseptate conidia. Under this generic concept,
about 250 species are included in this genus. However, Sutton & Hodges
(1979) and Hughes (1979) felt that Sporidesmium is heterogeneous, an opinion
conﬁrmed by Shenoy et al. (2006) who showed the polyphyletic nature of
Sporidesmium and its allies. Kirk (1982) proposed the new genus Sporidesmiella
P.M. Kirk for those species with cylindrical to cuneiform or obovoid, distoseptate
conidia. Subramanian (1992) reﬁned the generic concept of Sporidesmium in
a stricter sense as ‘conidiophores simple, determinate or irregular extending
proliferations, conidia solitary, gangliar, acrogenous and euseptate’, and proposed
several novel anamorphic genera, including Ellisembia Subram., Penzigomyces
Subram., Repetophragma Subram., and Stanjehughesia Subram., based on
the absence/presence of conidiophores, type of conidiophore extension, and
conidial septation (euseptate/distoseptate). Hernández-Guitiérrez & Sutton
(1997) and Shoemaker & Hambleton (2001) further modiﬁed this approach
by proposing Imimyces A. Hern. Gut. & B. Sutton, Linkosia A. Hern. Gut. &#Misc-exposition*]

[@18 ... Ma & al.#Page-header*]
[@B. Sutton, and Imicles Shoemaker & Hambl. However, Wu & Zhuang (2005)
merged Penzigomyces into Sporidesmium and Imicles into Ellisembia, thereby
expanding the generic concepts of Sporidesmium (euseptate) and Ellisembia
(distoseptate) to include fungi with typically lageniform, doliiform, or nodose,
percurrently extending conidiophores.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sporidesmium is worldwide in distribution, usually found as a saprobe on
rotten wood, dead branches, and decaying leaves of various plant species. (Ellis
1958, 1971, 1976, Wu & Zhuang 2005). During ongoing surveys of conidial
fungi associated with woody debris in tropical and subtropical forests of
southern China, four species clearly related to Sporidesmium sensu stricto were
collected from decaying twigs. Three represent species new to science while the
fourth is a new record from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments – Matsushima (1975) described this fungus as Sporidesmium sp.
Subsequently, Subramanian (1992) assigned it as a new species, S. takashii,
based on the earlier description. Sporidesmium takashii is morphologically
most similar to S. circinophorum and S. tropicale. However, S. takashii conidia
are distinctly smaller than those of S. circinophorum (conidia 120–220 × 10–
12 μm) and S. tropicale (conidia 80–250 × 12–15 μm). In addition, S. takashii
diﬀers from S. circinophorum (conidia versicolored, apex 2.5–3.5 μm wide)
and S. tropicale (conidia verruculose, apex 2–4 μm wide) in its concolorous,
smooth-walled conidia with a narrower apex. Compared with the morphology
of S. takashii described by Matsushima (1975) and Subramanian (1992), our
collection ﬁts well with the original description except for having more septa
(8–16 vs 5–10) and smooth-walled conidia. This is the ﬁrst report of this species
in China.#Misc-exposition*]
