[@Abstract — A new cercosporoid fungus, Pseudocercosporella stellariicola, was collected
on leaves of Stellaria aquatica (Caryophyllaceae). This fungus is described, discussed, and
compared with other similar hyphomycetes occurring on Stellaria and related genera:
Cercosporella echinulata, Phacellium episphaerium, Pseudocercosporella cerastii, and
Ps. woronovii. The phylogenetic relationship of Ps. stellariicola and other Pseudocercosporella
species within Mycosphaerellaceae is also inferred from the ITS rDNA sequence data.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a result of extensive studies conducted on the mycobiotas of cercosporoid
fungi in Korea from 1990 to 2000, Shin & Kim (2001) published a monograph
comprising 127 species in 14 genera on 151 species of host plants. Although
Stellaria aquatica, one of the most common wild plants in Korea, was frequently
found infected with Phacellium episphaerium, a previously undescribed leafspotting hyphomycete has also been found on this plant since 2004. This
fungus diﬀered from other similar hyphomycetes known to occur on Stellaria
and related genera. It was well characterized by colorless conidiophores in
dense fascicles, inconspicuous, unthickened conidial scars and solitary, hyaline
conidia. These features agree with the concept of Pseudocercosporella proposed
by Braun (1990), and this hyphomycete is identiﬁed and characterized as a
novel species in that genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Monoconidial isolates were deposited at the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection
(KACC) of the National Academy of Agricultural Science in Korea and the Centraalbureau
voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in the Netherlands. Genomic DNA was extracted using
mycelia harvested from colonies following a previously described method (Lee & Taylor
1990). The ITS rDNA region was ampliﬁed using universal primers ITS1/ITS4 (White
et al. 1990). The PCR amplicons were puriﬁed using a MultiScreen HTS™ PCR ﬁlter
plates (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Cork, Ireland) and sequenced using an ABI Prism™ 377
automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with a BigDye™
cycle sequencing kit v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems). The raw sequences were edited using
the DNASTAR computer package v. 5.05 (Lasergene, Madison, WI, USA). The ITS rDNA
sequences obtained from three isolates (KACC42363, KACC42395, and CPC11297)
have been deposited in GenBank with accession numbers EF600945, EF600956, and
GU214693, respectively. For phylogenetic analysis, available ITS rDNA sequences of
Pseudocercosporella spp. and closely related taxa belonging to Mycosphaerellaceae were
retrieved from GenBank. The sequences were aligned with ClustalX v. 2.1 (Larkin
et al. 2007). The Bayesian inference analysis was performed with MrBayes v. 3.1.2
(Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001). The GTR + G as nucleotide substitution model was
selected using jModeltest v. 0.1.1 (Posada 2008). One million generations with four
chains were run and a tree every 100th generation was saved. The ﬁrst 1000 of the 10,000
saved trees were discarded as burn-in. The resulting 50% majority-rule consensus tree
was visualized with TreeViewX (Page 1996). Branch support was calculated as posterior
probability (PP).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two cercosporoid hyphomycetes are presently known to occur on Stellaria
species. Cercosporella echinulata Garb., described on Myosoton aquaticum (L.)
Moench (≡ Stellaria aquatica), diﬀers from the new species by conidiophores
with an echinulate, denticulate apical part. Additionally, C. echinulata possesses
much longer (35–110 µm) conidiophores and narrower (1–2 µm) conidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although the identity of C. echinulata is unclear (according to Braun 1995), it
is easily diﬀerentiated from Ps. stellariicola. Phacellium episphaerium (Desm.)
U. Braun is also readily diﬀerentiated from the present species by its synnematous
fascicles of conidiophores and aseptate conidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Two Pseudocercosporella species are known on other caryophyllaceous host
plants. Pseudocercosporella cerastii (H.C. Greene) U. Braun (Braun 1995) known
on Cerastium spp. from Central Asia and North America is distinguished
from the new species by much narrower (0.75–2 µm) conidia. The leaf lesions
associated with Ps. cerastii are almost absent or diﬀuse, whereas those of
Ps. stellariicola are quite distinct by being circular to subcircular and delimited
by a dark border.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pseudocercosporella woronovii (Siemaszko) U. Braun recorded on Silene
spp. and Lychnis spp. in Europe (see Braun 1995) also produces (sub-)circular
lesions and amphigenous colonies on the leaves. However, Ps. woronovii diﬀers#Misc-exposition*]

1–5-septate conidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The complete ITS rDNA sequence data of the six Ps. stellariicola isolates
obtained were nearly identical, with only one base pair diﬀerence between
KACC42827 and the other isolates. They formed a separate clade distinct from
the other species of Mycosphaerellaceae (1.00 PP value) in the Bayesian tree
(Fig. 2). Our phylogenetic analysis indicated that Mycosphaerella cerastiicola
Crous is sister to the Ps. stellariicola clade (0.99 PP value); Ramularia spp.
are also phylogenetically close to the new species. In recent studies, based on
18S, 28S, and ITS-5.8S rDNA sequence analyses (Crous et al. 2009 & 2011),
isolate CPC11297 (representing Ps. stellariicola) was tentatively identiﬁed as
a Ramularia sp. based on its placement in the Ramularia clade. Nevertheless,
based on the morphological characteristics described in this study, the isolate
is better accommodated in Pseudocercosporella. In addition, the fact that
Ps. stellariicola is closely related with Ramularia spp. is not surprising, as
Pseudocercosporella is polyphyletic within Mycosphaerellaceae and Capnodiales,
as shown in previous phylogenetic studies (Crous et al. 2009, Frank et al. 2010)
and the present analysis. In conclusion, both morphological and molecular
data support Ps. stellariicola as a novel species.#Misc-exposition*]
