[@Abstract — Four species of Solicorynespora were collected on dead branches from tropical
or subtropical forests in southern China. The new species S. ligustri on Ligustrum quihoui,
S. machili on Machilus chinensis, and S. cryptocaryae on Cryptocarya chinensis are described,
illustrated, and compared with closely related taxa. Solicorynespora pseudolmediae is recorded
for the ﬁrst time from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Solicorynespora R.F. Castañeda & W.B. Kendr., erected by Castañeda &
Kendrick (1990) with S. zapatensis R.F. Castañeda & W.B. Kendr. as the type
species, was mainly characterized by conspicuous, single, determinate or
percurrently extending conidiophores and integrated, terminal, monotretic
conidiogenous cells with solitary, obclavate or pyriform, euseptate
phragmoconidia. These characters separate Solicorynespora from similar
genera including Corynespora Güssow (Güssow 1906), Corynesporella Munjal
& H.S. Gill (Munjal & Gill 1961), Hemicorynespora M.B. Ellis (Ellis 1972), and
Corynesporopsis P.M. Kirk (Kirk 1981). Keys to Solicorynespora species have
been given by Castañeda et al. (2004) and Ma et al. (2011b), based mainly
on conidial morphology. Until now, 15 species have been included within
Solicorynespora, with species circumscribed primarily based on conidial shape,
size, septation, ornamentation, lateral appendage and presence or absence of
a rostrum (Castañeda 1996, Castañeda et al. 2004, McKenzie 2010, Ma et al.
2011b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The forests of southern China have a rich mycota, and many lignicolous
fungi have been discovered there (Dai & Cui 2006, Yuan & Dai 2009, Zhang et

[@Comments –This species was originally assigned to Sporidesmium Link and
subsequently transferred to Corynespora (Holubová-Jechová & Mercado
1986) due to its monotretic conidiogenous cells. Castañeda & Kendrick (1990)
established the genus Solicorynespora and moved this species into the new genus
based on its euseptate conidia. Solicorynespora pseudolmediae is morphologically
similar to S. zapatensis in conidial shape, but diﬀers from the latter in conidial
size, wall ornamentation, and the number of septa. Comparing our collection
with the type material in Castañeda’s description (Castañeda 1984), the conidia
of our specimen are slightly larger (22–32 × 9–13 μm vs. 16–29 × 8.5–12 μm)
and the conidiophores are shorter (40–170 μm vs. 50–275 μm). Despite these
minor diﬀerences, we believe they are basically the same species.#Misc-exposition*]
