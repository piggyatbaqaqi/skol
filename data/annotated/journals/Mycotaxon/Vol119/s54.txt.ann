[@Abstract — Pseudobaeospora deckeri is described from the central California coast. This
new species is characterized by fruitbodies with deep purple to lilac tones, a pileipellis with
irregularly shaped erect elements, an undiﬀerentiated subpellis, absence of cheilocystidia,
and strong alkaline-virescent reactions in the pileus subpellis and stipe context.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Pseudobaeospora Singer has recently undergone a generic revision,
spurred by the recognition and description of many new taxa (Bas 2002, 2003).
Following this revisitation, novel Pseudobaeospora species were discovered
in Europe and California (Adamčík & Bas 2002, Desjardin 2004, Vellinga
2009). Two of the more recently described species are from the central coast of
California: P. stevensii Desjardin (Desjardin 2004), from cypress and redwood
habitats in Marin and San Mateo counties, and P. aphana Vellinga (Vellinga
2009), from Marin County. Considered with Tricholoma microsporum (Ellis)
Sacc. (not yet formally assigned to Pseudobaeospora), these species represent
the second and third Pseudobaeospora species reported from California and the
ﬁfth and sixth species reported from North America.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Following a cold precipitation event in March of 2009, many redwood-associated macrofungi (Hygrocybe spp., Entoloma spp.) fruited on the University
of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus. While surveying this assemblage, I
encountered a small purple agaric for which the generic disposition was not
immediately obvious. While investigating the fruitbodies closely, I collected a
range of representative specimens in January 2010, when the same mycelium
produced over forty fruitbodies. In December 2010, while surveying macrofungi
of the California coast with Erin Page Blanchard and Noah Siegel, I collected#Misc-exposition*]

[@specimens from two additional, relatively distant, sites on the central California
coast. A striking member of the Central California mycobiota, P. deckeri
represents the fourth described species of Pseudobaeospora in California and
the seventh in North America.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The macromorphology was described from fresh material. Micromorphological
features were observed from both fresh and dried material. Standardized color notations
were made using Kornerup & Wanscher (1984). Specimens were sectioned using a Nikon
SMZ-10A dissecting microscope and mounted in 3% KOH with and without staining
by aqueous Congo Red or Melzer’s reagent. Micromorphological features were observed
with a Nikon Eclipse E800 light microscope. Lamellae and lamellulae are denoted as L
and l, respectively. Spore measurements are given with the arithmetic means denoted as
Lavg × Wavg. DNA was extracted with Sigma Extraction Kit- REDExtract-N-Amp Plant
PCR using standard procedures; ITS1F and ITS4 primers were used for PCR reactions,
and cleanup was performed with Exosap. Sequencing reactions used Big Dye v3.1 at
1/8 strength of manufacturer’s instructions, on a 3730 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California). The resulting sequence was edited and assembled with
Sequencher 4.2.2 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan) and deposited in Genbank
(JF898319).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudobaeospora deckeri is a small agaric that occurs throughout central
California but probably has a wider distribution northwards. It is distinguished
by its deep purple to violet pileus with a pale pinkish bloom, white spores,
strong green KOH reactions, pileipellis with upright elements, frequent clamp
connections, and lack of cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Because of its deeply colored fruitbodies and KOH reactions, Pseudobaeospora
deckeri shows aﬃnity with P. pyrifera and P. jamonii in Bas’ infrageneric Pyrifera
and Frieslandica groups (Bas 2003). In Voto’s worldwide key, P. deckeri could
appear in either sect. Anistoderma Voto or sect. Pseudobaeospora, depending
on interpretation of the pileipellis (Voto 2009). Pseudobaeospora deckeri can
be distinguished from other members of the genus by its distinctly purple
coloration combined with its alkaline-virescent reactions, a pileipellis that is an
irregular cutis with abundant erect elements, abundant clamp connections, and
a lack of a distinctly cellular subpellis and cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In age, the fruitbodies resemble those of P. stevensii, with is sympatric at
two of the known sites. Side-by-side comparison of such sympatric fruitbodies
showed that P. stevensii possesses a ‘yellower’-brown stipe with a coarser,
paler, and generally more scurfy apex and a paler, more strongly strigose base,
completely lacks violaceous tones, and shows an olive-green KOH reaction that
is easily visible against the paler brown ﬂesh. This contrasts with P. deckeri, in
which the bluish-green color change in KOH is usually obscured by the purplish#Misc-exposition*]

[@464 ... Schwarz#Page-header*]
[@ﬂesh, and thus seeming blackish-vinaceous or blackish-olivaceous unless a thin
section is made to reveal a solidly bright green color. Micromorphologically,
P. stevensii has a cellular subpellis with no upright elements, cheilocystidia, and
slightly more elongate spores with a higher average Q value.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although photographs of P. pyrifera Bas & L.G. Krieglst. from Europe
show a macroscopically similar entity, P. pyrifera has short broadly clavate
cheilocystidia, a pileipellis of short, strongly inﬂated hyphae in chains, and a
diﬀerent KOH reaction in the stipe trama. Another European taxon, P. jamonii
Bas et al., has a paler pileus, nearly free lamellae, and a pileipellis with scattered,
broadly clavate erect elements amongst strongly inﬂated chains of hyphae (Bas
et al. 2002). Also macroscopically similar is P. dichroa Bas, which has intense
violet tones to the lamellae and stipe but a much paler pileus, only occasionally
(then only slightly) intervenose lamellae, and a reddish-purple KOH reaction
that eventually becomes yellowish-green. Pseudobaeospora euganea Voto
has a browner pileus, a pileipellis with only scattered erect elements and
a cellular subpellis, and signiﬁcantly longer spores (Q = 1.14–1.45) (Voto
2009). Pseudobaeospora cyanea Arnolds et al. is a European species with a
more intensely bluish-purple pileus, paler lamellae, a stipe with much less
violet coloration, encrusted elements in the pileipellis, and signiﬁcantly larger
(4.0–5.5 µm × 3.3–4.0 µm) spores (Arnolds et al. 2003).#Misc-exposition*]
[@At least four other members of this genus (some undescribed) occur
sympatrically, but all can be distinguished by their diﬀerently colored
fruitbodies. Pseudobaeospora aphana produces much paler fruitbodies and
smells distinctly ﬁshy (Vellinga 2009); microscopically it is distinguished by the
presence of cheilocystidia and a cellular subpellis. Species not known to occur
in California include “Pseudobaeospora pillodii” sensu Redhead, P. murrillii E.
Horak, Tricholoma microsporum, and Agaricus fuscolilacinus Peck, all of which
lack KOH reactions and diﬀer in other microscopic and macroscopic characters
(Desjardin 2004).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The ITS sequence obtained from the type collection was aligned against
that of Pseudobaeospora pyrifera; this comparison showed 93% identities
(E-value = 0.0), clearly demonstrating generic placement but distinct species–
level diﬀerence. Unfortunately, there are currently too few Pseudobaeospora
sequences in GenBank to perform broader phylogenetic analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
