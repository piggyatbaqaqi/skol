[@Abstract— An unrecorded Ceriporia species was collected during the ﬁeld survey in Korea
University Experimental Forests. Based on morphological characteristics and 28S, 18S, and
internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence analyses, the species was identiﬁed as Ceriporia
lacerata, new to South Korea. A key to the Korean Ceriporia species is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceriporia Donk is a genus of wood rotting fungi. It causes a white rot and
includes species with resupinate basidiocarps with white, red, purple, orange,
pink, or green pore surfaces, a monomitic hyphal system, simple septate or
rarely clamped generative hyphae, lack of cystidia or other sterile hymenial
elements, and subglobose to cylindric or allantoid basidiospores (Gilbertson
& Ryvarden 1986).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In Korea, previously three Ceriporia species have been reported (Lee & Jung
2005): Ceriporia purpurea (Fr.) Donk, C. reticulata (Hoﬀm.) Domański, and
C. viridans (Berk. & Broome) Donk. During our studies on diversity of
indigenous fungi in Korea University Experimental Forests, two specimens of
an unreported Ceriporia species were found. They were ﬁrst identiﬁed from
morphological characters, and sequence analyses of 28S, 18S and internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region supported the identiﬁcation. A detailed
description of the species and a key to the Korean Ceriporia species are provided
below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basidiocarps were collected in 2010 from one of the Korea University
Experimental Forests located in Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do (36°46ʹ13ʺN
127°58ʹ57–59ʺE). They were dried completely overnight using an air drier at 40˚C and
deposited at the National Biological Resources Center (KB).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Microscopic observation#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macro- and microscopic basidiocarp features were noted from the collected specimens.
Measurements and drawings were made from slide preparations mounted in 3% KOH
(Largent et al. 1977) using an Olympus BX51 light microscope. Average dimensions
were determined from > 20 measurements of each character. The characteristics of the
four Korean Ceriporia listed in Table 1 are based on our observations of C. lacerata
and descriptions of C. purpurea, C. reticulata, and C. viridans from previous studies
(Jung 1994, Lim et al. 2000, Lee et al. 2002). A key to Korean Ceriporia species was
constructed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genomic DNAs were extracted from basidiocarp hymenophores using Accuprep
Genomic DNA extraction kit (Bioneer, Korea). PCR reactions were performed using
Accupower PCR premix kit for 28S, 18S, and ITS rDNA, using primers LR0R/LR3
(Vilgalys & Hester, 1990), EukNS20F/EukNS1750R (Dams et al. 1988), and ITS1F
(Gardes & Bruns 1993) /ITS4 (White et al. 1990), respectively. 18S PCR ampliﬁcations
followed Suhara et al. (2003). 28S and ITS rDNA region conditions were as follows:
initial denaturation at 95°C for 7 min, followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 51°C for 30
s, and 72°C for 30 s, concluded by elongation at 72°C for 7 min. DNA sequencing was
performed in the DNA Engine Tetrad 2 Peltier Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD, USA) using
the ABI BigDye(R) Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA)
with aforementioned primers and an ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The sequences obtained in this study were deposited under the GenBank accession
no. JN618335, JN618336, and JN641758–JN641761. Maximum parsimony (MP) and
neighbor joining (NJ) analyses of each region followed Jang et al. (2011).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceriporia lacerata was ﬁrst described as a new species from Japan in 2003
(Suhara et al. 2003) and three years later reported from China (Cui et al. 2006,
Dai 2012). In Korea, C. lacerata strains have been isolated from playground
wood (Kim et al. 2005), CCA-treated wood (Kim et al. 2007), decayed pine
tree logs (Kim et al. 2009), and decayed bamboo (Kim et al. 2011). They
were also isolated from Mt. Bukhan (Seoul), Mt. Halla (Jeju), Mt. Joryeong
(Chungcheongbuk-do), Mt. Mani (Incheon), Mt. Yongmun (Gyeonggi-do),
and Yangpyeong Korea University Experimental Forest (Gyeonggi-do) in
2008–10 during the Korean indigenous species research project (unpublished
data) and basidiocarps were found in Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do, in
2010. Ceriporia lacerata occurs on both angiosperm and gymnosperm wood
and is widely distributed in China (Dai 2012). Our observation conﬁrms
C. lacerata within northeast Asia, and it is reasonable to infer that it inhabits
other Asian countries in the 30–45°N latitude.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphologically, Ceriporia lacerata is similar to C. alachuana (Murrill)
Hallenb. and C. ferruginicincta (Murrill) Ryvarden by having a whitish to
ochreous pore surface and oblong to ellipsoid basidiospores. However, the other
two species diﬀer in having pores with entire dissepiments (3–8 per mm in
C. alachuana and 6–8 per mm in C. ferruginicincta; Suhara et al. 2003),
contrasting with the entire to lacerate dissepiments (2–5 per mm) of
C. lacerata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The 28S and ITS rDNA phylogenetic trees had similar topologies with
Ceriporia lacerata forming a clade distinct from that of the other Ceriporia
species (Fig. 2). On the other hand, all the analyzed Ceriporia species were
monophyletic in 18S rDNA tree, as previously suggested by Wu et al. (2010),
with C. spissa (Schwein.) Rajchenb. sister to C. lacerata. Both species occur
on hardwoods and conifers, but C. spissa has bright orange basidiocarps
(Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1986). The phylogenetic conﬂict represented here is
probably the result of limited taxon sampling. More molecular data derived
from other species are needed for the clear elucidation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Since Kondo et al. (1999) reported that Ceriporia lacerata had the ability
to degrade polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxines (PCDDs) and polychlorinated
dibenzo-furans (PCDFs), its industrial potential has been investigated in
pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for eﬃcient hydrolysis and biofuel
production (Lee et al. 2007) and PAHs degradation (Lee et al. 2010). Remarkably,
Long et al. (2010) reported that C. lacerata had the highest decolorization ability
for synthetic dyes (Congo Red, Orange II, and Reactive Blue 4) among the#Misc-exposition*]
