[@Abstract — Acarospora gallica from Europe and Asia is revised and a neotype is designated.
Acarospora hungarica is proposed as a synonym of A. gallica. The anamorphic stage is
reported for the ﬁrst time from the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The study of the genus Acarospora in Europe rests on the strong foundation
of the great Swedish lichenologist A.H. Magnusson, whose primary work is his
classical monograph (Magnusson 1929). Nonetheless, some of the species he
described are known only from the type specimens or today are poorly known
by lichenologists in general. Acarospora gallica is among those poorly known
species, mainly because of confusion with A. fuscata, which it can superﬁcially
resemble. It also may be a rare or infrequent species in many countries. In
this paper we revise A. gallica as part of our study of Acarosporaceae in the
Czech Republic. We hope this paper will lead to easier and more conﬁdent
determinations of the species and to new discoveries.#Misc-exposition*]

standard microscopical techniques with an Olympus SZX 7 stereomicroscope or an
Olympus BX 51 ﬁtted with Nomarski diﬀerential interference contrast. Hand-made

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our description of Acarospora gallica diﬀers from Magnusson (1929) in
understanding that the thallus is variable, from areolate to squamulose in a
continuous range of developmental variation. This is probably inﬂuenced by
microhabitat conditions. It is often a solitary pioneer found in sunny open sites
on sharp-edged volcanic rocks, serpentine stones, diabase, shale, and even
on toxic substrates in the abandoned sedimentation basins of Chvaletice and
Bukovina in East Bohemia (Palice & Soldán 2004). These populations consist#Misc-exposition*]

[@378 ... Knudsen & Kocourková#Page-header*]
[@usually of small broadly attached areoles, often with a single apothecium and
the thallus reduced to a pseudothalline margin. On smooth substrates in
microhabitats with more moisture and possibly nitrogen, particularly in central
Europe, the areoles are larger, usually with multiple apothecia, and are often
lobulate and squamulose, with a broad elongated mycelial base (gomphate) or
a narrow stipe.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Specimens of Acarospora gallica with several apothecia per areole correspond
to Magnusson’s original concept of the species (see drawing in Magnusson 1936).
Acarospora gallica var. vinealis H. Magn. has its type locality of Svätý Jur (St.
Georgen) in Slovakia. The name was applied to three specimens with an even,
more contiguous thallus, with areoles with multiple apothecia (Magnusson
1929). The type material of this variety was not available for study, but the
description matches some specimens collected by the second author from Czech
Republic. We observed that areoles with multiple apothecia were usually in the
process of vegetative division or the apothecia eventually merged into a large
irregularly shaped disc. Magnusson (1929) inconsistently referred thalli with
predominately dispersed areoles with a single apothecium (sometimes with the
thallus reduced to a pseudothalline margin) to A. gallica var. devastata (Eitner)
H. Magn. Actually areoles with a single apothecium dominate in the specimens
we examined, possibly because they are easier to distinguish from A. fuscata.
We do not recognize Magnusson’s two varieties as infraspeciﬁc categories but
only as typological abstractions of a normal variation. Acarospora hungarica was
described from a single specimen with well-developed ≤ 1 mm wide squamules
(Magnusson 1929). We treat A. hungarica as a synonym of A. gallica.
Acarospora gallica is easily confused with A. fuscata (Ach.) Th. Fr., which
it can resemble in color and which also produces gyrophoric/lecanoric acids.
Acarospora fuscata has a black lower surface and is broadly attached, usually
forming a contiguous areolate crust. It is the most common species throughout
the range of A. gallica. Macromorphological characters are diagnostic for
separating the two species. Acarospora gallica is easily distinguished from
A. fuscata either by its lobulate squamules with pale underside or by
predominance of small areoles with a single apothecium. Poorly developed
specimens of A. gallica may be almost impossible to determine and may be
reported as A. fuscata (as in Palice & Soldán 2004). Squamulose A. gallica
specimens with lower sides darkened by substrate interactions can be
distinguished from A. fuscata by the presence of a well-developed mycelial base
or stipe, lobulate margins, and usually multiple apothecia per areole, sometimes
growing in agglomerations. Careful examination of the thallus, may also reveal
some pale lower surfaces.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Though A. gallica is widespread in Europe and Asia, collections are sparse,
making its distribution, abundance, and conservation status uncertain for each#Misc-exposition*]

[@Acarospora gallica, neotypiﬁed ... 379#Page-header*]

[@country where it occurs. It may be undercollected or collections may have
been misdetermined as the ubiquitous A. fuscata. For instance, it was known
in the Czech Republic from several early 20th century collections (Magnusson
1929; Suza 1928, 1931, 1947) but reported only once by Vězda (1998). But our
study has established its presence in eleven localities in Bohemia and Moravia.
Several vouchers were originally identiﬁed as A. fuscata or other species. It is
frequent in Czech Republic and not threatened.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Magnusson (1929, 1930) reported A. gallica var. devastata from North
America. We do not recognize A. gallica as occurring in North America and
all the specimens from North America identiﬁed by Magnusson belong to
A. janae K. Knudsen (Lumbsch et al. 2011; Knudsen et al. 2011). Acarospora
janae especially diﬀers from A. gallica in forming small areoles or verrucae that
never become squamulose.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Galloway (2007) reported A. gallica from New Zealand, but we are skeptical
of his determination based on the current known distribution of the species.
His taxon may be conspeciﬁc with an undescribed taxon from South America
collected by Adam Flakus that we are currently studying.#Misc-exposition*]
