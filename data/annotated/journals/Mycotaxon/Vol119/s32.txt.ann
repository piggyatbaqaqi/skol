[@Abstract — The authors describe a new bisporic basidiomycete, Gymnopus inusitatus
var. cystidiatus, collected in Hungary. It diﬀers morphologically from var. inusitatus by the
presence of well-developed cheilocystidia and ecologically by growing in the sandy grassland
under Salix. Its taxonomic position is conﬁrmed by DNA studies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@During his mycological ﬁeld research in Hungary, the second author found
a fungus macroscopically similar to Mycetinis scorodonius (Fr.) A.W. Wilson
& Desjardin, but lacking a garlic-like smell. Moreover, microscopic studies
showed that it belongs to the genus Gymnopus (Pers.) Roussel, species group
of G. inusitatus/bisporus/catalonicus of sect. Levipedes (Fr.) Halling, subsect.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Alkalivirentes Antonín & Noordel. Species of sect. Levipedes are characterized
by a pileipellis composed of inﬂated, often lobed to coralloid, elements
(dryophila-type) and the taxa of subsect. Alkalivirentes by wall encrustations
that turn green in alkali (Antonín & Noordeloos 2010), a division supported by
molecular studies. DNA sequences of nuclear ITS and partial LSU ribosomal
RNA genes from holotypes of the above-mentioned taxa were identical.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on this result and morphological similarities, we propose synonymy of
G. inusitatus, G. bisporus, and G. catalonicus. We propose a new variety for the
Hungarian collection, which diﬀers microscopically and ecologically from the
typical G. inusitatus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Macroscopic description of collected specimens is based on a photo and dry
specimens. Colour abbreviations follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1983); herbarium
abbreviations follow Holmgren & Holmgren (1998). Nomenclatural authorities are cited
according to the International Plant Names Index Authors website (http://www.ipni.org/
ipni/authorsearchpage.do). Microscopic features are described from dried material
mounted in H2O, c. 5% KOH, Melzer’s reagent, and Congo red using an Olympus BX50 light microscope with a magniﬁcation of 1000×. Measurements are designated for
basidiospores by E (quotient of length and width in any one spore) and Q (mean of
E-values) and for lamellae by L (number of entire lamellae) and l (number of series of
lamellulae between each pair of entire lamellae).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The nuclear ribosomal RNA ITS and LSU regions from the specimen were sequenced
as well as those from the types the type specimens of Gymnopus bisporus (BCN–SCM B4065), G. catalonicus (BCN–SCM B-4057), and G. inusitatus (BCN–SCM B-4058). Both
DNA extraction and PCR ampliﬁcation were conducted twice, with new PCR reagents
used each time.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA was isolated from dried herbarium specimens using PowerSoil™ DNA Isolation
Kit (Mo-Bio). PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in the Mastercycler® ep thermocycler
(Eppendorf) according to Tomšovský & Jankovský (2008). Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea)
sequenced the ampliﬁed fragments.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Newly obtained sequences were edited manually using BioEdit version 7.0.9. (T. Hall,
Ibis Biosciences). Selected sequences from Gymnopus sect. Levipedes species. published
by Mata et al. (2006) were retrieved from GenBank and added to the dataset (Fig.
1). Gymnopus brassicolens and G. impudicus were selected as outgroup taxa. The ITS
alignment with gaps consisted of 790 characters including 630 constant and 160 variable
sites.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Bayesian analysis used MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) and bestﬁt model (GTR+G) and parameters given by MrModeltest (Nylander 2004). Markov
chains initiated from a random tree were run for 2,000.000 generations with samples
taken every 100th generation. The generation number excluded a burn-in of 200 000
generations; Tracer v1.4.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) determined the
statistics.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The additional PHYML analysis for estimating maximum likelihood phylogenies was
run at the server Phylogeny.fr (Dereeper et al. 2008) in “A la Carte” mode. Alignments
were treated with Gblock to eliminate poorly aligned positions and ambiguous regions;
GTR substitution model was selected for the ITS dataset. Bootstrap branch support
values (BP) were estimated in PHYML under the maximum likelihood criterion using
default 100 replicates. There were 659 (89% of the original 790 positions) positions
analysed in PHYML after Gblock treatment.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The LSU sequences were not analysed due to the limited number of similar sequences
available in the Genbank.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

Hungarian collection and the holotypes of Collybia inusitata, C. bispora, and#Misc-exposition*]

[@hyphae with greenish brown incrustation in KOH forming a cutis or only a
poorly developed dryophila-structure, and cylindrical, clavate, fusoid, often
irregular terminal cells, an absence of caulocystidia, and ecologically by growing
in sandy grasslands under Salix.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In this group of bisporic taxa, Antonín & Noordeloos (2010) distinguished
two species — Gymnopus bisporus (syn. G. catalonicus) with a brown to reddish
brown (marginally paler) pileus and basidiospores measuring 9.0–11(–12)
× 4.5–5.5(–6.0) μm and G. inusitatus with a reddish brown to violaceous
brown pileus (cream to ochraceous-brown when drying), and slightly
narrower basidiospores measuring 10–14 × 4.0–5.0 μm. Both species lack true
cheilocystidia (Fig. 4). The basidiospore size variation in this group of taxa is
distinctly wider than admitted by the current anatomic-morphological species
concepts. The same situation was noted for European species in the Psilocybe
cyanescens group (Borovička 2008, Borovička et al. 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The most important diagnostic characters of G. inusitatus var. cystidiatus
are the presence of well-developed cheilocystidia and a diﬀerent. All three taxa
synonymized under of G. inusitatus var. inusitatus were collected in xerothermic
acidophilous stands with various Cistus species (Pérez-De-Gregorio & Carbó
2002, Vila & Llimona 2002). Gymnopous inusitatus var. cystidiatus was collected
in calcareous sandy grasslands under Salix. Its type locality lies in the Great
Hungarian Plain in the northwestern part of the Pannonic sand steppes where
the open xeric grassland is dominated by the Pannonian endemic Festuca
vaginata on dune tops and communities of Salix rosmarinifolia and other Salix
species in the moist interdune depressions. The Hungarian collection represents
the ﬁrst record of G. inusitatus in central Europe.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Species from the G. dryophilus group diﬀer from G. inusitatus by a welldeveloped dryophila-structure in the pileipellis, tetrasporic basidia, and smaller
basidiospores. Gymnopus erythropus (Pers.) Antonín, Halling & Noordel. has
red-brown coloured hairs on the stipe base like G. inusitatus but diﬀers in
basidiome colour, smaller basidiospores ((5.0–)5.5–8.0(–9.0) × 3.5–4.5(–5.0)
μm), tetrasporic basidia, and diﬀerently shaped cheilocystidia (Antonín &
Noordeloos 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The macroscopically similar Gymnopus earlei Murrill from North
America has a larger (≤ 35 mm broad) pileus, buﬀ or pale orangish yellow
(later orangish buﬀ) lamellae, a more robust stipe (10–46(–90) × 2–5 mm),
smaller basidiospores (5.6–7 × 2.8–3.5 μm), mostly tetrasporic basidia, and
inconspicuous cheilocystidia (Halling 1983, Vilgalys & Miller 1983). Gymnopus
bicolor A.W. Wilson et al. has similar cheilocystidia and a poorly developed
dryophila-structure, but it has crowded lamellae, a larger (22–28 mm broad)
pileus, a more robust stipe (30–42 × 2–3 mm), tetrasporic basidia, and smaller
basidiospores (5.2–8 × 2.4–3.6 μm; Wilson et al. 2004).#Description*]
