[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pezizales are characterized by unitunicate asci that generally open by
rupturing to form a terminal or eccentric lid or operculum (Hansen & Pﬁster
2006). Of the 1638 pezizalean species known, Geopora Harkn. and Peziza Dill.
ex Fr. are represented by 13 and 104 species respectively (Kirk et al. 2008).
From Pakistan three Geopora species — G. arenicola (Lév.) Kers, G. arenosa
(Fuckel) S. Ahmad, G. foliacea (Schaeﬀ.) S. Ahmad) — and eight Peziza species
— P. badiofusca (Boud.) Dennis, P. cerea Bull., P. gerardii Cooke, P. micropus
Pers., P. pakistanica (S. Ahmad) S. Ahmad, P. repanda Pers., P. vesiculosa Bull.,
P. violacea Pers.) — have been reported (Ahmad 1978; Ahmad et al. 1997).
This paper describes two taxa of Pezizales newly recorded from Pakistan. The
specimens were ﬁrst identiﬁed morphologically, after which the ITS1+5.8S+
ITS2 rDNA regions were ampliﬁed for comparison with GenBank sequences
of related species. Eighty-seven taxa of Pezizales were previously reported from
Pakistan; the addition of our recently collected Geopora cooperi f. cooperi and
Peziza succosa) raises that total to 89.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Collected ascocarps were photographed and necessary ecological data were recorded
in ﬁeld. The specimens were dried with the help of fan heater and preserved with
tentative ﬁeld No., for further studies. Apothecia were rehydrated and free hand sections
were made in the laboratory. Microscopic (morpho-anatomical) characters were noted
at 10× and 40× and drawings were made with the help of camera lucida.#Misc-exposition*]

[@302 ... Ashraf & Khalid#Page-header*]
[@DNA was extracted from dried ascomata, using Extract N. Amp.TM Plant kit (SIGMA).
nrDNA of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 was ampliﬁed using fungal speciﬁc and universal primers
pairs (ITS1F/ITS4 and ITS1/ITS4, respectively) under the following parameters:
denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, then with 35 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 54°C and 1
min 30 s at 72°C, and a ﬁnal ampliﬁcation at 72°C for 2 min. Bidirectional sequencing
of the puriﬁed PCR products was done by Macrogen Inc. (South Korea). ITS sequences
were compared using BLAST in GenBank to conﬁrm our identiﬁcations.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The specimens have been deposited in the Pezizales collection of LAH Herbarium,
Department of Botany, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan. Sequences have been
accessioned in GenBank.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascocarp: 5–5.5 cm broader, globose to oblong, irregularly convoluted, outer
surface dark brown and covered with light brown hairs, inner surface pinkish
white to white, highly convoluted, convolutions close but separate. Hymenium:
200–250 μm thick. Asci: Long cylindrical, operculate, centric operculum,
unitunicate, 8-spored, uniseriate, non-amyloid, tapering at base, (213–)
221–260 × (16–)19–21 µm. Ascospores: Broadly oval-elliptical, hyaline,
smooth, thin walled, with a large central guttule, cytoplasm dense around
the guttule, (19–)20–23(–25) × 13–14 µm. Paraphyses: Long, slender, septate,
swollen at the tips, nearly of same level as ascus, apical cell 14.5 µm broad.
Excipulum: Ectal excipulum: textura globulosa, 120 µm, 3–4 cells thick, cells
oblong to circular in section, smooth, walls thick and dark brown, 24–40 ×
18–27 µm, cells on the outside darker than the inner cells. Outer cells of the
excipulum forming abundant, hyaline to light brown hairs, that are ﬂexuous,
branched, 11–13 µm wide, thick-walled, (walls up to 3 µm). Medullary
excipulum of textura intricata, thin walled hyphae, hyaline to light brown.

[@Comments: Geopora cooperi diﬀers from other epigeous Geopora species by
producing truﬄe-like ascocarps with a small basal opening and a heavily folded
layer (Tamm et al. 2010). It diﬀers from most other truﬄe-like fungi because
of the forcible discharge of ascospores: truﬄe spores are usually not forcibly
expelled from the ascus. Mycorrhizal interaction of Geopora cooperi with Pinus
ponderosa P. Lawson & C. Lawson and the orchid Epipactis atrorubens (Hoﬀm.)
Besser has been established (Sheﬀereson et al. 2008). Geopora cooperi f. cooperi
diﬀers from G. cooperi f. gilkeyae Burds. in the narrower oval to elliptical
ascospores (Burdsall 1968). Our DNA sequence analyses matched the 625
nucleotide ITS region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) from the Pakistani collection with that#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: Peziza succosa has strongly amyloid asci, with the bluing reaction
strongest at the apex, although no pronounced bluing ring is present. With other
ectomycorrhizal fungi, P. succosa has been reported in deciduous forests and is
widespread in Europe, North America (Hansen et al. 2001, Michell 2006), and
Asia (DH Pﬁster, pers. comm.). ITS sequence analyses of our collection showed
it to be 99% identical with P. succosa (DQ200840.1) from Fredericksburg Have,
Zealand, Denmark.#Misc-exposition*]
