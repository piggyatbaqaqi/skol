[@Abstract — A discussion on the importance of morphological features in the taxonomy of
Ganoderma subg. Ganoderma is presented. More than 500 specimens of 37 species, including
33 types, were checked: G. argillaceum, G. atkinsonii, G. boninense, G. capense, G. chonoides,
G. colossus, G. concinnum, G. corrugatum, G. curtisii, G. dorsale, G. elegantum, G. longistipitatum,
G. mexicanum, G. multicornum, G. multiplicatum, G. nevadense, G. nitidum, G. oerstedii,

G. pulverulentum, G. ravenelii, G. resinaceum, G. sequoiae, G. sessile, G. sessiliforme,
G. simulans, G. stipitatum, G. subfornicatum, G. subincrustatum, G. vivianimercedianum,
G. weberianum, and G. zonatum. Color of the context, resinous deposits, structure of the
basidiospores, and protuberances of the pileipellis cells are among the most important
features for characterization of the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ganoderma P. Karst. is characterized by its double-walled, colored
basidiospores with a truncate or subacute apex and ornamented exosporium.
The genus includes species with both dull [subg. Elfvingia (P. Karst.) Imazeki]
and laccate pilei (subg. Ganoderma). The pileipellis has been diﬀerently
characterized by diﬀerent authors: (1) Furtado (1965a) refers to a derm of the
palisadoderm type in Elfvingia and layer of cells in a hymeniderm in Ganoderma,
while Steyaert (1980) refers to a trichoderm in Elfvingia and “hymenioderm”
in subg. Ganoderma. Clémençon (2004) used “crustohymeniderm” for
subg. Ganoderma, so following his deﬁnition, the Elfvingia pileipellis is a
crustotrichoderm, because it is also incrusted with a resinous matter. Although
phylogenetic analyses (Moncalvo 2000, Hong & Jung 2004) support the#Misc-exposition*]

[@202 ... Torres-Torres & Guzmán-Dávalos#Page-header*]
[@monophyly of Ganoderma and its classiﬁcation in two subgenera, there are
many problems in the resolution below subgeneric level.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The micromorphological structures of some species or groups in Ganoderma
have been studied by, among others, Patouillard (1889), Murrill (1902), Haddow
(1931), Heim (1962), Furtado (1965a,b, 1967), Steyaert (1967a,b, 1972, 1975,
1977), Pegler & Young (1973), Corner (1983), and Adaskaveg & Gilbertson
(1988). More recently, Gottlieb & Wright (1999) made a detailed study of the
basidiospores under the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in an attempt
to solve some of the inter-speciﬁc problems. However, these studies have been
restricted to a rather limited number of species and few used the pileipellis cells
as a critical character in their species concepts.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Through the study of more than 500 specimens (including 33 types)
mainly from Africa, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, and USA, we analyzed the
morphological variation of structures in Ganoderma subg. Ganoderma with
the following aims: 1) to study in detail structures currently and potentially
useful in taxonomy and phylogenetic analyses and 2) to probe the utility of
light microscopy in deﬁning basidiospore pillars.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Specimens examined#Misc-exposition*]

[@More than 500 specimens from the herbaria BPI, BR, ENCB, FH, H, IBUG (including
collections by the ﬁrst author), INB, K, NY, O, PC, SP, UPS, and XAL were examined
(acronyms follow Holmgren et al. 1990). These specimens comprised 37 species, which
are listed in Table 1, which includes one representative specimen for each species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Macro and micromorphological observations and identiﬁcation#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following macromorphological characters were described for each basidiome:
length, width, thickness, adhesion to the substrate, general shape, consistency, weight;
pileus shape, surface consistency, color; context thickness, stratiﬁcation, color, resinous
deposits; pore form, number per mm, consistency, color; tube length, stratiﬁcation, color.
Macrochemical reactions used 10% KOH. In addition to the traditional microcharacters,
descriptions include: basidiospore apex, disposition and size of basidiospore pillars,
and pileipellis cell size, shape, and incrustations. Color references follow Kornerup
& Wanscher (1963). Microscopical observations were made from basidioma tissues
mounted in 10% KOH and Melzer’s reagent, with Congo red, phloxine, and cotton blue
additionally used. Basidiospore shape is determined from the Q ratio (l/b; Bas 1969:
320–321) of 20 randomly selected basidiospores. Only mature pileipellis cells were
described. Microscopical observations were made using a 100× oil-immersion objective
in Zeiss K7 and Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscopes. The inter-walled basidiospore pillars
were measured using Axio Vision 4 software with the Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope.
Most morphological terms follow Vellinga (1998), Furtado (1965a), and Clémençon
(2004). The pileipellis description follows the concepts of Clémençon (2004).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiome shape and substrate attachment are of rather restricted value for
taxon delimitation; however, basidiome consistency, weight, and thickness as
well as the presence and attachment of the stipe proved, in some cases, to be
valuable for identiﬁcation. Ganoderma atkinsonii, G. colossus, G. nevadense,
and G. oregonense have light, spongy basidiomata, while G. zonatum and
G. pulverulentum have light, woody-corky basidiomata. Ganoderma mexicanum,
G. sessile, G. sessiliforme, and G. subincrustatum have relatively light, woody
basidiomata, while Ganoderma oerstedii has heavy, woody basidiomata.
Ganoderma colossus, G. oregonense, G. oerstedii, G. sessile, and G. zonatum
are generally robust, while G. mexicanum, G. parvulum, G. sessiliforme, and
G. weberianum have slender basidiomata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The more important features of the pileus context for diagnosing species
are: (1) consistency, (2) structure, and (3) presence of resinous deposits. Only
three types of context consistency are recognized. Two — soft-spongy and
ﬁbrous — are easy to distinguish, but there is an intermediate state between soft
and ﬁbrous that is diﬃcult to identify. In this study, the third type was termed
“ﬁbrous-spongy.” Ganoderma colossus and G. oregonense have soft-spongy
context, G. sessiliforme has ﬁbrous context, and G. resinaceum has ﬁbrousspongy context.
The context structure is classiﬁed as (1) duplex, (2) not fully homogeneous,
or (3) homogeneous. In the duplex context there is an abrupt change, with
two separate, contrasting colors, the upper generally light-colored and the
lower generally darker close to the tubes, although shades may vary to some
extent. This context type is present in G. concinnum, G. curtisii, G. dorsale, and
G. sessile (Fig. 1). Not fully homogeneous is used when there is an evident color
diﬀerence between the upper and lower parts but without abrupt color changes,
like in G. oerstedii (Fig. 2), G. perturbatum, G. perzonatum, G. weberianum
(Fig. 3), while a homogeneous context has only one color, as in G. parvulum
and G. resinaceum (Figs. 4–5). Contexts with an occasional very thin darker
line just above the tubes that is absent in some specimens are considered as
homogeneous. The context can contain resin-like deposits (hard and brittle,
dull or shiny) that often they form continuous bands (here “resinous bands,”
see G. oerstedii and G. parvulum in Figs. 2, 4) or discrete bodies (here “resinous
incrustations,” see G. weberianum, Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Some authors (Patouillard 1889, Moncalvo 2000, Seo & Kirk 2000) have
dismissed the stipe as a character of no taxonomic value, because some sessile
species can develop a stipe in the laboratory resulting from varying oxygen
conditions. Nevertheless, the stipe is a useful character, with a “true” stipe
deﬁned as one > 5 cm and with tissues diﬀerentiated from the pileus context.
Some species develop a generally short (<5 cm) pseudostipe that is merely a#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiospores. Following Clémençon’s (2004) terminology, all Ganoderma
basidiospores have a thin, smooth or rugose, hyaline to reddish-yellow
perisporium; an ornamented colored exosporium with pillars, and a thick
reddish-brown or yellowish-brown endosporium. Using the Q ratio categories
(Bas 1969), most species have ellipsoid to elongate (= oblong) basidiospores,
while G. concinnum, G. dorsale and G. perturbatum have distinctively widely
ellipsoid to ellipsoid basidiospores and G. ravenelii and G. zonatum have oblong
to cylindrical basidiospores. Ganoderma basidiospores have a cap in the apex
(Figs. 6–7) that is obtuse and hyaline; after drying, the cap generally collapses
and breaks, making the basidiospore apex truncate (Figs. 7–8). However, in
some species where the cap is absent or very small, the basidiospores have
a subacute apex, as in G. atkinsonii, G. colossus, G. concinnum, G. dorsale,
G. longistipitatum, G. oregonense, and G. perturbatum (Figs. 9–11).
The basidiospore inter-walled pillars are thin to thick; thin (<0.3 μm)
in G. mexicanum, G. perzonatum, G. praelongum, and G. zonatum (Figs.#Misc-exposition*]

G. oerstedii, G. pulverulentum, G. resinaceum, G. sessiliforme, G. subincrustatum,

G. longistipitatum, G. oregonense, and G. perturbatum (Figs. 18–20). The pillars
can be free, sub-free, partially anastomosed, and reticulate (= anastomosed).
“Free” pillars appear as dots on the basidiospore surface (e.g. G. perzonatum,
fig. 21), while “sub-free” are free dots mixed with short anastomosed to shortly
elongated structures (e.g. G. elegantum, fig. 22). “Partially anastomosed”
is used when more than two pillars are grown together to form an irregular
surface (e.g. G. concinnum, fig. 23), and “reticulate” is when the ornamentation
forms an almost complete net (e.g. G. colossus, fig. 24).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Structure of the pilear cover. The pilear surface or pileipellis is formed by
a cell layer similar to a hymeniderm, although in the majority of the species the
cells do not originate from the same level as in the true hymeniderm. Clémençon

[@matter. Cell sizes must be interpreted with care because they vary not only
between species but also in the same specimen according to where the section
has been made. Most species have club-like apical cells although there are
species with branched or knobby cells besides the club shaped cells (Fig. 25).
The shape of the crustohymeniderm cells can be: (1) cylindrical (G. perzonatum), (2) almost cylindrical to narrowly clavate (G. weberianum), (3) widely
clavate (G. perturbatum), and (4) clavate (most species). The cell wall is thick
for all except G. colossus, where it is thin. A thick wall may be multi-stratiﬁed,
related to the maturity state of the basidiomata; however, some species, like
G. perturbatum, have an evidently multi-stratiﬁed wall. Some young pileipellis
cells present secondary septa, more evident in the cells of the pileus periphery;
furthermore, these peripheral cells tend to be lighter and shorter. Incrustations
or granulations can also be present in the pileipellis. The incrustations are easily
dissolved in KOH [e.g. G. stipitatum, fig. 27], while the granulations remain,
because they are not alkali-soluble (e.g. G. perzonatum, fig. 26).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In some species the pileipellis cells have a transition from smooth club-like
to antler-like cells. Protuberances and branches (as used in the descriptions
below) diﬀer in that “protuberances” are short projections or prolongations of
the hyphal wall (generally≤ 8 μm long, located laterally or at the apex) that lack
a lumen whereas “branches” may be short or large, apical or lateral but always
possess a lumen. There are shape series in which the cell changes progressively,
but a predominant shape is always observed (Fig. 25). Three large groups of
crustohymeniderm cells might be found: entire (Figs. 25a, 26–28), lobulatebranched (Figs. 25b, 29–30), and branched (Fig. 31).
1) “Entire” crustohymeniderm cells are cylindrical, cylindrical with slightly
wide apex, cylindrical to narrowly clavate, cylindrical with subcapitate apex, or
narrowly clavate to widely clavate, generally lacking protuberances or branches,
very occasionally with at most two, generally lateral protuberances, e.g. in
G. perturbatum, G. perzonatum, G. stipitatum, and G. sessiliforme (Figs. 25a,
26–28).#Misc-exposition*]
[@2) “Lobulate-branched” crustohymeniderm cells may be subdivided into:
a) clavate cells, with 1–3 round short thick protuberances and/or branches,
but preserving the clavate shape (e.g., G. nitidum; G. zonatum, Fig. 25b); b)
cells with no or 1-2 thick long branches and ≤ 7 short thick protuberances,
where the clavate shape is generally lost (e.g., G. oerstedii; G. subincrustatum,
Figs. 25c, 31; G. multiplicatum, Figs. 29–30).#Misc-exposition*]
[@3) “Branched” crustohymeniderm cells, with two types that generally lose
the clavate shape: a) with 2-3 thin long branches with small protuberances (e.g.,
G. orbiforme, Fig. 25d) and b) the most striking, cells with many antler-like
branches and small protuberances (e.g., G. multicornum, Fig. 25e).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphal system. In all species the hyphal system is di-trimitic, where generative
and binding hyphae are generally diﬃcult to observe. All generative hyphae have
clamped septa and are hyaline to yellowish and (in almost all species) branched.
Skeletal hyphae are of the arboriform type, thick-walled to solid, yellowish to
yellowish-brown, apically branched; thin in the crustohymeniderm, wider in
the context. Binding hyphae are generally thinner than skeletal hyphae, hyaline
to yellowish-brown.#Misc-exposition*]

elements in the hymenium. According with this deﬁnition G. colossus,
G. oregonense, G. perzonatum, G. pulverulentum, G. sequoiae, and G. stipitatum
have cystidia (Figs. 32–34), but they are diﬃcult to observe.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is clear that species concepts vary in Ganoderma according to the author.
Historically, Ganoderma taxa have been treated as species with great plasticity
(e.g. G. resinaceum by Ryvarden, 2004) or (contrariwise) very narrowly
(Steyaert 1972, 1980). Bazzalo & Wright (1982) and other authors, especially
when synonymizing various diﬀerent species under the same name, considered
context color of little value. On the other hand, Steyaert (1967a) regarded the
resin-like deposits as unimportant, mainly in the species of subg. Elfvingia.
However, we found that these deposits together with context color are important
in separating taxa. The resin-like deposit (termed “melanoid deposits” by
Gottlieb & Wright, 1999 and melanoid substance by Steyaert, 1980) was called
by Ryvarden (2000) “resinous bands,” the term adopted here but more narrowly
so as to diﬀerentiate actual resinous bands from more generalized resinous
incrustations (small, fragmented deposits that do not form bands).
Ganoderma basidiospores have been traditionally described as double
walled with a thin exosporium and thick endosporium, echinulate or with
inter-walled pillars, or struts, or sinuous ridges, with truncate apex (Patouillard
1889, Murrill 1902, Haddow 1931, Overholts 1953, Corner 1983, Tham 1998,
Ryvarden 2000, 2004 among others). The terms exosporium, episporium, and
endosporium have been diﬀerently applied for the authors mentioned above
if Clémençon (2004) is followed. Steyaert (1977) described the basidiospores
with epi-endosporium and echinulate ecto-perisporium, sometimes the ectoperisporium crestate besides echinulate. Bazzalo & Wright (1982), who used
“perisporium” and “endosporium,” considered the ornamentation as derived
from the endosporium, in contrast to Clémençon (2004), who determined that
the exosporium forms the ornamentation. As deﬁned by Kirk et al. (2008),
echinulate (diminutive of echinate: “having sharply pointed spines”) does
not apply to the inner ornamentation seen in Ganoderma, so we prefer to
describe it as pillars. Bazzalo & Wright (1982) and Gottlieb & Wright (1999),#Misc-exposition*]

[@who observed the basidiospore pillars under SEM, proposed them as useful in
determining species. We emphasize their usefulness by noting that not only are
the pillars seen through SEM, pillar characters like size and disposition are also
visible through light microscopy.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The basidiospore cap has been variously named: “bouchon perisporique”
(Heim 1962), apical papilla (Furtado 1962), umbo (Corner 1983), and cap
(Tham 1998). As mentioned above, when the cap collapses and breaks the
basidiospore apex looks truncate; in few cases appears subacute, because the
cap is very small or even absent. The term subacute, described by Steyaert
(1972) for basidiospores with unchanged apex or apex unaltered at maturity,
was adopted by Corner (1983), although this character has not been used
systematically. We consider that it is an important feature in diagnosing taxa;
for example, it supports G. perturbatum as independent from G. resinaceum and
related to G. dorsale. Ganoderma concinnum, G. dorsale, G. longistipitatum, and
G. perturbatum form a distinctive group of species by their stipitate basidiomata
and subacute basidiospore apices.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Basidiospore shape is also an important diagnostic character. Oblong to
cylindrical spores diﬀerentiate G. ravenelii and G. zonatum from morphologically similar species such as the ellipsoid spored G. curtisii and G. orbiforme.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pileus surface is a complex structure in which the crustohymeniderm cells,
hyphae and resinous-like substances are immersed. Many discussions on its
taxonomic importance in Ganoderma have been made (e.g. Furtado 1965a,
Gottlieb & Wright 1999, Steyaert 1980); however, its current use is limited,
perhaps caused by a lack in precise terminology. Much of the complexity is
caused by the great variability in the branching pattern of the cells in the same
basidioma, creating confusion and diﬃculty to ﬁnd a collective term. TorresTorres & Guzmán-Dávalos (2005) realized that pileipellis cells vary greatly
in size and shape depending on the site sampled and on the basidiome age.
For this reason, tissues should be cut away from the basidiome edge, and only
mature cells must be compared.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Imazeki (1939) and Steyaert (1980) classiﬁed genera based on pileipellis
(dermis) type. Bazzalo & Wright (1982) had regarded pileipellis types described
by preceding authors as valuable for identifying large groups but not useful for
delimiting species. Subsequently, Gottlieb & Wright (1999) considered three
general dermis types based partly on Steyaert (1980): a) “hymeniodermis vera,”
b) “hymeniodermis formed by diverticulate hyphae… with similar endings,
though wider through the apex, and with lateral branches, acanthophyseslike,” and c) “hymeniodermis spheroid-pedunculate… composed of claviform
ﬁlaments, with or without lateral diverticules, but always with emerging
spheroid-pedunculate or capitate knobs at the apex.” Their acceptance of these
dermis types and basidiospore ornamentation as useful for delimiting taxa has#Misc-exposition*]

[@been conﬁrmed in the present investigation. However, we found it diﬃcult
to assign species to one of these pileipellis types, we prefer to describe cells
according to shape and the number of branches and protuberances. There is
one species complex — G. boninense, G. multiplicatum, G. orbiforme, G. subfornicatum and G. oerstedii, all with yellowish-brown to reddish-brown context
and pileipellis cells with protuberances and/or branches — in which species
are diﬀerentiated base on basidiospore features and pileipellis cell shape and
branch numbers.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Karsten (1881) did not mention cystidia in his original description of
Ganoderma, and many mycologists accepted his non-cystidiate concept
(Haddow 1931, Heim 1962, Furtado 1965b, 1967, Steyaert 1967b, 1972, Bazzalo
& Wright 1982, Gilbertson & Ryvarden 1986, Ryvarden 1991, 2000). Although
Corner (1983) noted that Demelius (1919) referred to acute ‘cystidioles’ in
G. applanatum (Pers.) Pat. (subg. Elfvingia) and G. lucidum (Curtis) P. Karst.,
we follow Vellinga (1998) and regard them as true cystidia that are present in
at least ﬁve species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In conclusion, we consider that additional important features for
characterizing Ganoderma species that can be directly observed or under light
microscopy should include context color, structure, and resinous deposits;
basidiospore pillar disposition and size; and pileipellis cell shape, protuberances,
branches, and granulations.#Misc-exposition*]
