[@Abstract — New localities of Gyalidea minuta in Central Europe are reported. The
distribution, ecology, and morphological variation of the species are discussed and
diﬀerentiating characters presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Gyalidea was resurrected by Vězda (1966) and by Vězda & Poelt
(1991). Currently included in the Solorinellaceae (Baloch et al. 2010). Gyalidea
was earlier referred to the Asterothyriaceae and Gomphillaceae (see Henssen
& Lücking 2002, Lumbsch & Huhndorf 2010). The genus is characterized by
a crustose thallus, zeorine apothecia with a mostly well-developed thalline
margin, an Ostropales-type ascus, a non-amyloid hymenium with simple
to sparsely branched and septate paraphyses, and hyaline, muriform (or
transversally septate) ascospores (Vězda 1966; Vězda & Poelt 1991; Henssen &
Lücking 2002; Aptroot & Lücking 2002). The thallus is usually inconspicuous
and the apothecia small. Gyalidea is a cosmopolitan genus with over 40 species
(Vězda & Poelt 1991; Kirk & Cooper 2009), many of which have been described
in the last two decades (see Lumbsch et al. 2009). They are rather rare lichens,
some known only from the type material or very few collections. Most species
grow on soil, rocks, mosses, or plant debris, and only a few occur on tree bark. In
Europe there are only two epiphytic species, G. minuta (van den Boom & Vězda
1995) and the recently described G. fruticola (Svensson & Thor 2007). Until
recently, G. minuta had been found only in three localities in southwestern and#Misc-exposition*]

[@western Europe. Here we report the ﬁrst record of G. minuta in Central Europe
and discuss its distribution, ecology, and morphological variation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The specimens were morphologically examined by standard microscopic techniques.
Hand-cut sections and squash preparations were examined in water, a 10% aqueous
solution of KOH, and Lugol’s solution. Measurements of well-developed free ascospores
lying outside the asci were measured in water at ×1000 magniﬁcation. The description
below is based on the isotype and newly collected specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type: Portugal, Algarve (holotype, herb. van den Boom 14875 [not seen]; isotype, herb.

[@Thallus epiphloedal or partly endophloedal, corticolous, scattered among
substrate wrinkles, grayish green, without visible prothallus. Apothecia sessile,
hyaline with a brownish tinge, translucent when wet, 0.15–0.2 mm diam., 0.1
mm tall (0.2–0.4 × 0.1–0.15 mm in water preparation). Hymenium colorless,
45–75 µm tall. Paraphyses simple, not broadening towards the tips, 1.5–2.0 µm
in diam., indistinctly septate. Asci cylindrical-clavate, wall slightly thickened
at apex, 8-spored, 28–40 × 7–9 µm. Ascospores ellipsoid, with rounded to
attenuate ends, muriform, with 3–5 transverse septa, and 1–3(–4) longitudinal
septa, (9.5–)10–17(–20) × 4.5–7.5(–9) µm. Pycnidia not observed. Chemistry
not tested by TLC.#Description*]
[@Ecology – In western Europe the species has been reported from the bark
of Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus sp. trees in shady, humid forests and among
shrubs (van den Boom & Vězda 1995, Sparrius et al. 2002).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In Poland, it has been found only in forest conditions. One locality is a
narrow strip of land (ca. 50 m wide and about 2 km long) adjacent to a lake
with an anthropogenic forest community of an unusual structure. The tree
layer consists of middle-aged pine and the shrub layer of Berberis sp., Crataegus
sp., Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus cathartica, Sambucus nigra in which the
common buckthorn (R. cathartica) dominates. The dense shrub-layer and the
proximity to the lake give rise to highly humid sheltered conditions. Gyalidea
minuta grows here on the bark of the buckthorns only and is intermixed with
lichens common to this area (Anisomeridium polypori (Ellis & Everh.) M.E.
Barr, Bacidina sulphurella (Samp.) M. Hauck & V. Wirth, Coenogonium pineti
(Schrad. ex Ach.) Lücking & Lumbsch, Lepraria incana (L.) Ach., L. lobiﬁcans

(Körb.) Gams ex Coppins, Psoroglaena abscondita (Coppins & Vězda) Hafellner

[@The second locality is in a pine forest planted in soils that naturally favor
oak–linden–hornbeam forest. In this habitat, G. minuta grows at the bottom of
Acer pseudoplatanus trunks mixed with abundant Bacidina sulphurella. Other
lichen species include Lepraria incana, L. elobata Tønsberg, and Parmelia
sulcata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the Czech Republic G. minuta has been collected in a shady, damp forest
of mostly Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior within part of an old spruce–
beech forest reserve. Here the species grows abundantly around bark rifts of
Fraxinus trunks accompanied by Lepraria sp., Lecanora pulicaris (Pers.) Ach.,
and Phlyctis argena (Ach.) Flot.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments – This constitutes the ﬁrst report of Gyalidea minuta from Central
Europe. The ﬁrst specimen from Poland, found in 2001, diﬀers from the type
in apothecial shape and in the number and arrangement of septa. A. Vězda
(pers. comm.) suggested that these diﬀerences were great enough to support
a new species, but a ﬁnal taxonomic decision was postponed in view of the
small specimen size. No new material was found until 2009 when the ﬁrst
author found a larger population within 2 km of the ﬁrst locality. In the same
year the species was also found in the Czech Republic. Analysis of the rather
rich material from both countries showed that all specimens represent a single#Misc-exposition*]

[@species, Gyalidea minuta. Detailed measurements have shown that the Central
European specimens deviate slightly: the ascospores are slightly smaller with
3–4 transverse septa and the apothecia are generally larger and more ﬂattened
(Table 1). Furthermore, the exciples of dead apothecia are not persistent, as
in the isotype specimen. These diﬀerences are probably due to the fact that
the previously collected specimens are small and poorly developed and do not
reﬂect the full variability of the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is worth noting that despite the relatively detailed and long-term
observations in Poland, there are very few records of G. minuta. This may
indicate that the species has an ephemeral nature, although it is also easily
overlooked in the ﬁeld.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Despite its variability, Gyalidea minuta is quite distinctive due to its
occurrence on the bark of trees and shrubs, its very small, pale and almost
translucent apothecia, and the barely visible thallus. The only other epiphytic
Gyalidea species — the recently described G. fruticola (Svensson & Thor 2007),
which also occurs on the bark of shrubs — diﬀers in its larger, whitish grey
to light yellowish brown apothecia and considerably longer, more septate
ascospores. Additionally, G. fruticola has a well-developed true exciple that
almost encloses the disc. In wet conditions, G. minuta resembles Coenogonium
pineti in the ﬁeld, but the microscopic features diﬀer markedly. Rich photo
documentation of the isotype and Central European collections is available on
