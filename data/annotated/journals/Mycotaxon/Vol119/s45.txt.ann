[@Abstract — Two new species, Tuber microspermum and T. microspiculatum, are described
from China. Tuber microspermum is characterized by small asci and spiny reticulate
ascospores; T. microspiculatum can be separated from the other species with spinoreticulate
ornamented ascospores by numerous minute meshes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@China is especially rich in species of Tuber. Since the ﬁrst publication on this
genus describing a new species from China, T. taiyuanense B. Liu (Liu 1985),
many previously described and new species have been published (Wang 1988;
Wang & Li 1991; Wang et al. 1998; Wang & He 2002; Tao et al. 1989; Chen et
al. 2005; Chen & Liu 2007; Fan et al. 2011). Because all Tuber species grow
underground, it can be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd specimens. Therefore, the number
of species in China is inevitably underestimated. After continuing investigation
of the genus in China, we describe and illustrate two additional new species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The materials were collected from the local mushroom market in Kunming, China.
The specimens are deposited in BJTC (Herbarium Biology Department, Capital Normal
University). Macroscopic characters were described from fresh specimens. Microscopic
characters were described from razor-blade sections of fresh specimens mounted in 3%
KOH; sections were stained with Melzer’s reagent, rinsed, and mounted in polyvinyl
lactic glycerol to make permanent slides for archiving with dried specimens. For
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ascospores were scraped from the dried gleba
onto doubled-sided tape, which was mounted directly on an SEM stub, coated with
gold-palladium, and examined and photographed with a HITACHI S-4800 SEM.#Misc-exposition*]

towards the outer surface; inner layer composed of intricately interwoven
hyphae, hyaline, thin-walled, branched, septate, 2.5–5 µm in diam. Gleba

white to white-yellow veins. Asci subglobose, ellipsoid or irregular, hyaline,
thick-walled (3–5 µm), 45–70 × 40–60 µm, mostly with a short stalk, 1–5
spores. Ascospores ellipsoid to broad ellipsoid, dark brown at maturity,
15–25(–27.5) × 12.5–20 µm in 2–5-spored asci (30–35 × 22.5–25 µm in
1-spored asci) excluding ornamentation; ornamentation distinctly spinoreticulate, spines 4–6 µm high, straight mostly, the meshes generally 3–6 across
the spore width.#Description*]
[@Comments — Tuber microspermum is characterized by the small ascospores
and asci. In ascospore pattern the new species resembles T. pseudoexcavatum,
which is easily distinguished by a diﬀerent ascoma that is typically excavated
at the base (Wang et al. 1998). Other closely related Tuber species with spinyreticulate spores are T. taiyuanense and T. huidongense (Liu 1985; Wang & He
2002), which can be separated from T. microspermum by their larger ascospores
and asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — Tuber microspiculatum diﬀers from all related species with spinyreticulate ascospores by spore ornamentation with very minute and numerous
meshes, which are so narrow that they can be easily confused with the spines
under light microscope. SEM observation (Fig. 8) is helpful in clarifying the
characteristics.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Species of the T. rufum complex, which appear similar to T. microspiculatum
under the light microscope, can be separated by the presence of isolated spines
on the ascospore surface.#Misc-exposition*]
