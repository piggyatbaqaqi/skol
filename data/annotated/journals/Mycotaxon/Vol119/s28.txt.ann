[@Abstract – Two new corticioid species, Hyphoderma bicystidiatum and H. subglobosum, are
described from Kangra Hills in Himachal Pradesh.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words – northwestern Himalaya, angiosperm host#Misc-exposition*]

[@While conducting fungal forays in district Kangra of Himachal Pradesh,
India, Priyanka collected two interesting corticioid fungi that were referred
to Hyphoderma based on detailed macroscopic and microscopic comparisons
(Eriksson & Ryvarden 1975, 1976; Martin & Gilbertson 1977; Rattan 1977;
Burdsall & Nakasone 1983; Dhingra 1989, Dhingra & Singla 1993, Natarajan
& Kolandavelu 1998, Dhingra & Singh 2009, Dhingra et al. 2009, Singh et al.
2010). The specimens could not be assigned to any known taxa and are here
described as two new species. Samples of both collections were sent to Prof.
Nils Hallenberg, who also supported the concept of referring the new species
to Hyphoderma.#Misc-exposition*]

part. Basidia 13.6–22.3 × 6.2–7.5 µm, clavate to subclavate, 4-sterigmate, with
oily contents and basal clamp; sterigmata up to 4.8 µm long. Basidiospores

basidiospores. It diﬀers from both, however, in having clavate, thick-walled,

branched, with clamps at all septa, thin-walled; hyphae almost parallel to the
substrate in the basal zone, gradually becoming vertical and densely intertwined
in the subhymenial and hymenial zones. Cystidia 50.0–69.0 × 8.0‒–11.8 µm,
clavate, smooth, thin-walled. Basidia 22.0–34.0 × 6.8–10.0 µm, clavate to

[@Remarks—The subglobose spores and the clavate cystidia with light refracting
content are diagnostic characters. Hyphoderma subglobosum is close to
H. clavigerum in having similarly shaped cystidial elements but diﬀers
considerably in the shape of basidiospores i.e. subglobose in comparison to#Misc-exposition*]
