[@Abstract — We assert that the suppression at the 2011 Melbourne Botanical Congress of
the dual nomenclature for pleomorphic fungi was premature since most fungal genera still
remain inadequately typiﬁed and need molecularly based revisions. The new system turns a
rule-determined nomenclature into a system of names to be decided by committees. The new
system cannot be implemented until experts publish well-documented rationales about the
generic names to be accepted or suppressed among alternative morphs and the responsible
committees act oﬃcially. Prioritization vs. suppression is not the same as conservation vs.
rejection. If a teleomorphic generic name is suppressed, it still remains valid and legitimate
and can still serve as a basis for names of higher-rank taxa. In most cases the teleomorph genus
name should be prioritized unless convincing arguments favor preference of the anamorph
name. Paraphyletic genera must be recognized. Unless the phylogenetic positions of all type
species for possible morphs are conﬁrmed, no prioritization can be ﬁxed. When a binomial
in a prioritized genus has a younger epithet than the corresponding name in the suppressed
genus, only priority of extant names in the prioritized genus should count.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words — anamorph-teleomorph connection, competing morph names#Misc-exposition*]

[@Uniﬁcation of fungal nomenclature (one name, whether teleomorphic or
anamorphic, is allowed for each taxon) had to come eventually (Hawksworth
et al. 2011, Norvell et al. 2011), but the move is being enforced much too early
while only a minority of fungal taxa has been examined phylogenetically#Misc-exposition*]

[@496 ... Gams & al.#Page-header*]
[@(Hibbett et al. 2007). As currently circumscribed, too many fungal genera
are unconﬁrmed as homogeneous and monophyletic (such proofs may not be
possible for some genera), and knowledge of correlations between anamorph
and teleomorph genera is far from comprehensive (Gams et al. 2011); however,
Hawksworth et al. (2011) cited the ability to link anamorphs and their
teleomorphs by molecular means as a key reason for the rapid adoption of the
new rules. Names of lichenized fungi have always been excluded from dual
nomenclature and are little aﬀected by the issues discussed here (Lendemer
2011). While the previous Article 59 might not be reinstated (and cannot
even be considered until the 2017 International Botanical Congress), we must
ﬁnd solutions to minimize the disruptive eﬀects of this decision for fungal
nomenclature and systematics. That the new procedures will depend on
committee decisions listed in databases rather than on adherence to clear-cut
rules of a Code will obviously be a source of conﬂicts.#Misc-exposition*]
[@A key sentence in Paragraph 1 of the Preamble in the ICBN (McNeill et al.
2006) is crucial to our argument: “This Code aims at the provision of a stable
method of naming taxonomic groups, avoiding and rejecting the use of names
which may cause error or ambiguity or throw science into confusion.” This
fundamental principle seems to be ignored by what has happened: Previous
editions of the Code established democratically accepted rules subject to
adjustment every six years by general voting in the Nomenclature Sessions.
The newly prescribed rules and processes for determining the correct names
for pleomorphic fungi reject these long understood, fair rules in favor of nonappealable decisions rendered by a series of Committees. It is still unknown
how these newly adopted processes will be put into practice. Language adopted
in Melbourne requests “consultation with” but does not actually mandate the
involvement of non-IAPT committees (that have no legal standing vis-à-vis
the Code). Nomenclatural stability, a principle long stated in the Code,
seems to have been abandoned in favor of committee-based decisions governing
the choices and applications of names for exactly those fungi whose complex
biologies and multiple reproductive forms need governance by clear rules, not
by consensus in committees.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Gene-based data can never be the sole basis for meaningful, informative
classiﬁcations of any organism without also incorporating the essential
foundations of morphology and other traditional characters. Imperfectly
known taxa (new or old) need to be recollected for more study of their genes
and morphologies before being reclassiﬁed. Fieldwork and ecological and
morphological studies will be indispensible to the additions into GenBank of
genetic data for innumerable neglected taxa. Deposits of accurate gene sequence
data from incorrectly identiﬁed source organisms is a widespread problem that
can confuse and seriously damage later analyses based on false assumptions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Minimizing nomenclatural chaos after Art. 59 ... 497#Page-header*]

[@While environmental DNA sampling might indicate that fungi are present, it
reveals nothing about the appearance and biology of the fungi from which that
DNA came, how to recognize them, or whether and how these fungi interact
with any other organisms.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Some supporters of the one-fungus one-name (1F=1N) concept seem
to assume that all fungi will readily yield good DNA and clean sequences.
However, many entomophthoraleans resist repeated attempts by skilled
technicians to obtain clean DNA and useful ampliﬁcations of genes now
widely accepted (and expected) to provide phylogenetically informative data.
Some taxa in the Xylariaceae yield either no cultures from too-scanty available
materials or no useful PCR products from even freshly collected stromata.
Further, some xylarioid stromata have at times provided contaminant DNA
that was later shown to represent diﬀerent taxa of the same or closely related
xylariaceous genus (Stadler et al. 2010, Stadler 2011). Although Xylariaceae
harbors few known endophytic species, some do grow hyperparasitically on
xylarioid taxa; consequently, DNA extraction from stromata should be strongly
discouraged, given that which organism provides the DNA sequence within a
xylarioid stroma may remain uncertain. Endolichenic fungi may cause even
more confusion (Arnold et al. 2009). As fungi generally grow in complex
aggregations in nature, often only a skilled morphologist can ascertain that a
culture actually represents what was thought to be the original inoculum. Some
fungi may never be culturable unless new techniques are developed for isolation
and growth, while special methods may also be needed to purify and to amplify
their DNA. Anamorph-teleomorph relationships can hardly be proven in such
cases, and phenotype-based taxonomic concepts must be maintained for the
time being.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Art. 57.2 (new) In pleomorphic fungi (including lichenicolous fungi, but
excluding lichen-forming fungi and those fungi traditionally associated with
them taxonomically, e.g. Mycocaliciaceae), in cases where, prior to 1 January
2013, both teleomorph-typiﬁed and anamorph-typiﬁed names were widely used
for a taxon, an anamorph-typiﬁed name that has priority is not to be taken
up until retention of the teleomorph-typiﬁed name has been considered by the
General Committee and rejected [our emphasis].#Misc-exposition*]

[@This rule implies that the duality of names should not be suppressed until the
responsible committees have rendered and publicized their decision about
the preferential use of a particular name. Thus, mycological editors should
be patient and tolerant with authors who may still prefer to use teleomorphtypiﬁed generic names, even if the corresponding anamorph name is older.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Prioritization—choosing between competing morph names for an individual
pleomorphic fungus—vs. conservation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@New text passed in Melbourne to appear in the ICN:
Art. 14.13 (new) In the interest of nomenclatural stability, for organisms
treated as fungi (including lichenicolous fungi, but excluding lichen-forming
fungi and those fungi traditionally associated with them taxonomically, e.g.
Mycocaliciaceae), lists of names may be submitted to the General Committee,
which will refer them to the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (see Div. III) for
examination by subcommittees established by that Committee in consultation
with the General Committee and appropriate international bodies. Accepted
names on these lists, which become Appendices of this Code once reviewed
and approved by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi and the General
Committee, are to be listed with their types together with those competing
synonyms (including sanctioned names) against which they are treated as
conserved (see also Art. 56.3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Prioritization. We strongly suggest referring to the choice among competing
morph names as prioritization, an action that is not equivalent to conservation.
While Art. 14.13 requires such choices to be “treated as conserved,” such status
would confer permanent validity to frequently misapplied names.#Misc-exposition*]
[@To clarify this, Art. 14.13 should be amended to deal with suppressed
names. Among competing anamorphic (occasionally synanamorphic) and
teleomorphic names for the same taxon, one of the “name pair” will be given
preference while the use of the other(s) is suppressed. Although suppressed
names are not available for use, however, they remain nomenclaturally valid
and legitimate. This condition diﬀers fundamentally from the status of a nomen
rejiciendum. In contrast to conservation, an act of prioritization need not be
irreversibly ﬁxed if convincing arguments support a change.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Consequently, names of teleomorphic genera that may be suppressed in
favor of associated anamorphic generic names remain available as bases for
higher-rank names and would not disrupt the current general systematics of
Ascomycota that would be severely aﬀected by the issues discussed here.
Until July 31, 2011, teleomorph-typiﬁed names had precedence over
anamorph-typiﬁed names irrespective of temporal priorities. Under the new
rules, priority of publication should generally determine the choice. It is,
however, true that the great majority of names for fungal families (and higher
ranks) are based on teleomorph-typiﬁed genera. Because all teleotypiﬁed
generic names remain legitimate and available as a basis for higher-rank taxon
names, there is no objection to this (Art. 18.3 ICBN), and no changes at higherrank names will become necessary for purely nomenclatural reasons. Basing
any higher-rank names on anamorph-typiﬁed generic names might be desirable
in some cases, but it must be discussed. If, for example, the name Trichoderma#Misc-exposition*]

[@Minimizing nomenclatural chaos after Art. 59 ... 499#Page-header*]

[@were prioritized over Hypocrea, should this require introducing the names
‘Trichodermataceae,’ ‘Trichodermatales,’ etc.? Because family names adhere to
the rule of priority, would the name ‘Trichodermataceae’ have precedence over
Hypocreaceae simply because of the priority of the genus name?
The new rule abandoning the preference of teleomorph-names for higher
ranks of fungi may encourage the description of many higher taxa (families,
orders, etc.) for clades of exclusively anamorphic Ascomycota. This would be a
new — and undesirable — situation. Certain anamorph names have later been
correlated with symplesiomorphic characters that have little or no use in formal
taxonomy but do serve as descriptive terms.#Misc-exposition*]
[@For the prioritization of single or listed fungal names well-documented
proposals must be submitted and published, e.g. in Taxon, as well as posted
on an appropriate website. It might be helpful to ﬁrst propose a preliminary
prioritization that would become deﬁnitive only after a certain period of
testing (e.g., after 2 years).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Decisions about prioritization will be made by authorities comprising a)
a committee of experts (the largest, most diverse group reasonably possible),
b) the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Fungi (ICTF), and c) the
IBC Permanent Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (NCF). The NCF then will
report to the General Committee. A majority of at least 60% of the votes (the
NCF present practice—including abstentions, but suggested for (a) excluding
abstentions) should be required for a decision. Art. 14.13 alludes to committees
a) and b) as “appropriate international bodies.” A primary concern is, who will
bear the responsibility of establishing individual committees of experts?
The size and scope of any expert committee must vary according to the
fungi under consideration to assure diverse points of view and geography; the
constitution of these committees should and must be debated — and consensus
reached — before they are established. The greatest problem will be ﬁnding
mycologists competent in all fungal groups to be tackled. If enough experts are
not found for a particular group or if no molecular analyses are available, then
no prioritization of names should be decided. It will be a task of each expert
committee’s members to draft proposals of preferred names and vote on them.
For example, Hypocrea vs. Trichoderma is being debated within the International
Subcommission on Trichoderma and Hypocrea Taxonomy (ISTH); its outcome
will be reported to the ICTF and NCF, who may (or may not) conﬁrm it and
publish their decision. In this case, the cellulase producer Trichoderma reesei and
some other biocontrol strains of Trichoderma spp. are commercially important.
Although the name of the T. reesei correlated teleomorph, Hypocrea jecorina, is
also becoming widely used, preference would be given to Trichoderma, which
is the older name anyhow. Does a preference for Trichoderma then force species#Misc-exposition*]

[@500 ... Gams & al.#Page-header*]
[@like H. pulvinata (in the anamorphically little-diﬀerentiated Trichoderma sect.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Hypocreanum) and H. danica, H. peltata, H. rhododendri, H. spinulosa, etc. (no
anamorphs) (Jaklitsch 2011) into Trichoderma?#Misc-exposition*]
[@The problem is that there are a) several groups of fungal taxa on which
nobody is really working and b) other groups that are being well studied but
by diﬀerent authors with entirely incompatible concepts. How can a committee
scenario work in these cases?#Misc-exposition*]
[@The implication that “expert groups” shall join in committees to treat their
respective ﬁelds of specialty may pose serious problems. Taxonomic concepts
in the Eumycota have always been highly variable (including even the name
for all fungi). The introduction of molecular phylogenies raised the hope that
such controversies might be resolved, but we now know this will not be the
case. In fact, progress with molecular phylogenetic studies for diverse higher
fungal taxa has been highly variable and depends on the variably patchy
funding available to taxonomic specialists in diﬀerent fungal groups. Sound
molecular phylogenies are very diﬃcult to achieve for innumerable fungal
taxa for which most constituent species are neither epitypiﬁed nor available
in cultures. Many who supported implementation of the 1F=1N concept seem
not to have realized that morphological and other phenotypic data still provide
more information on which to base classiﬁcations, especially where a limited
number of sequenced genes fails to provide convincing proof of relatedness.
It is gravely worrying that too many new layers of authorities whose opinions
may diﬀer (and, indeed, be mutable) are injected into what was previously a
process with universally recognized rules based on priority and an established
line of authority to achieve stable, enduring nomenclatural decisions. The
new system of committees adjudicating names en masse means that research
ﬁndings not favored by a committee can simply (and dangerously) be “voted
out” of oﬃcial recognition.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Suggested general working rules for committees#Misc-exposition*]
[@Names of genera#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anamorph and teleomorph genera were hitherto based on anamorph and
teleomorph traits, respectively. Adoption of unitary nomenclature necessitates
emending all pleomorphic generic diagnoses to recognize both anamorphic
and teleomorphic characters, whether present or not. All mycologists should
welcome such improvements because separating information about alternate
morphs into multiple descriptions fails to communicate vital and complete
information about the whole organism. Although we have often recognized
some degree of polyphyly in many important anamorphic genera, we have until
now preferred that teleomorphic genera be (as far as possible) monophyletic.
The inverse situation may arise, however, when a more narrowly deﬁned#Misc-exposition*]

[@Minimizing nomenclatural chaos after Art. 59 ... 501#Page-header*]

[@anamorphic genus takes precedence over a teleomorphic one. In that case, the
teleomorph genus may continue to be used as an artiﬁcial “dustbin” of teleomorph
species with or without known anamorphs. For example, many Mycosphaerella
anamorphs may be submerged into some morphologically and phylogenetically
well-deﬁned anamorphic genera such as Cercospora and Ramularia (Crous
et al. 2009, Crous 2010), thus forcing Mycosphaerella to become a “dustbin”
for species without known anamorphs. An equally undesirable alternative
would be combining many hundreds of species from several anamorph genera
into Mycosphaerella, which already contains ca. 2000 species. Morphological
comparisons among species would become impossible in such a huge genus
unless anamorph characters were correlated with phylogenetic ones. To avoid
such problems, will we be forced to accept gigantic genera characterized only
by statistics based on (minimal) DNA data?#Misc-exposition*]
[@If Puccinia were prioritized over Uredo s.str., the synonym ‘Uredo’ would
not be available for species with diﬀerent teleomorphs, thus requiring the
proposal of new generic names to accommodate them. Art. 14.13 may need to
be amended in order to repair this undesirable situation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Serious problems will arise for teleomorph genera such as Cordyceps and its
recent segregates, each of which is associated with multiple distinct anamorph
genera — many of which may form distinct clades and have names with
nomenclatural priority over their linked teleomorph genus. Further splitting of
(teleomorphic) genera may become advisable in such cases rather than lumping
multiple disparate anamorphs within one teleomorphic genus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@This situation is exempliﬁed by the relatively rare Asian teleomorphic genus
Metacordyceps G.H. Sung et al. (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) (Sung et al. 2007;
also see Kepler et al. 2012) whose anamorphs include the globally distributed,
commercially important entomopathogenic genera Metarhizium Sorokīn
1883 and Nomuraea Maubl. 1903, as well as Pochonia Bat. & O.M. Fonseca
1965 (including species used for biocontrol of nematodes) and other species
not placed in any anamorphic genus after the phylogenetic reclassiﬁcation of
Paecilomyces sect. Isarioidea Samson 1974 (Luangsa-ard et al. 2005, Sung et
al. 2007). That these anamorph genera are phylogenetically and ecologically
distinct may justify the preferential use of the anamorph names. Nevertheless,
the younger teleomorph name Metacordyceps also carries relevant information.
Although we generally prefer to retain precedence for the teleomorphtypiﬁed generic name over its correlated anamorphic name, we must accept
exceptions.
Exceptions to the precedence of teleomorph-generic names#Misc-exposition*]

[@Exceptions from this rule are allowed, although objective criteria are not
yet clearly worded in the new Art. 57.2. To the Trichoderma-Hypocrea and
Metarhizium-Metacordyceps examples noted above, we add the so-called#Misc-exposition*]

[@502 ... Gams & al.#Page-header*]
[@“macromycete” groups (those forming conspicuous stromata) in Ascomycota
for possible exception.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Some Hypocreales (as in other ascomycete groups with economically
important species, such as plant parasites or industrially cultivated fungi) have
already been studied thoroughly by molecular methods. Taxonomic authorities
familiar with these fungi will tend to follow the molecular results to adjudicate
the status of the core taxa. However, their anamorph names for some of these
fungi may prevail in future nomenclature, because the anamorphic stages
that cause the conspicuous disease symptoms were described long before
their corresponding teleomorphs. Nonetheless, nearly all xylarialean experts
will admit that the number of taxa whose molecular characters have already
been thoroughly evaluated is wholly insuﬃcient to make ﬁnal nomenclatural
determinations, since the phylogenies based on housekeeping genes vs. rDNA
present wholly divergent results about relationships among these fungi. The
numerous experts (all also signatories of Gams et al. 2011) will surely agree
that there is no need to change the current taxonomic system. Anamorphs
of Xylariales are widely known but treated as synapomorphies, so that dual
nomenclature was abandoned for these genera decades ago, whereas such
well-known and conserved generic names as Xylaria, Hypoxylon, and Daldinia
continue to take preference. Their anamorphic names are actually used as
features that characterize subfamilies (or, in the future, perhaps, families or
orders). The so far prevailing preference for teleomorph names could or should
be adapted for all Ascomycota unless very serious reasons (including priority)
make it more practical to adopt the anamorph name (as for Penicillium and
anamorphs of Metacordyceps).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The latest revision of Penicillium (Samson et al. 2011) provides more
examples: the teleomorphic name Eupenicillium has had little application
or relevance, with Penicillium already treated as holomorphic by Raper &
Thom (1948); however, for species of the more distantly related teleomorphic
Talaromyces (whose anamorphs in Penicillium sect. Biverticillium still needed
a new generic name), the teleomorph name was chosen to replace the better
known anamorphic names in Penicillium. Must all these cases be decided again
in the newly prescribed High Courts of Mycology by jurors yet to be selected?
In the future, teachers of mycology may be hard pressed to explain to their
students why some genera of the Xylariaceae have nodulisporium-like or
geniculosporium-like anamorphs but those of the “Trichodermataceae” (or
“Trichodermatales”) have Hypocrea-like teleomorphs. Recruitment of young
fungal taxonomists is already very diﬃcult; those who led the 1F=1N movement
and championed the decisions adopted in Melbourne even used this diﬃculty
as a major argument in their favor. Teaching of mycology might become more
complex if suprageneric taxonomic ranks were often based on anamorphic#Misc-exposition*]

[@Minimizing nomenclatural chaos after Art. 59 ... 503#Page-header*]

[@names, but such an argument seems to give little credit to the ability of students
to understand these complications.#Misc-exposition*]
[@A further consequence of complex connections between anamorph and
teleomorph genera is the necessary recognition of paraphyletic genera, such
as Lecanicillium, which Gams & Zare (2001) described, at the same time
recognizing its paraphyly. The current PCR-driven, monophyletic world view
also seems to reject the perfectly valid, widely held position that paraphyletic
taxa are not only acceptable, but that recognizing them as such is natural and
appropriate. Zoologists, who have long accepted the reptiles as a transitional
group from which the birds have arisen, do not deny Reptilia its own taxonomic
status, even where both molecular and comparative anatomic studies prove
that birds + reptiles are a paraphyletic class. It is hard to grasp why some
mycologists fervently want to impose strict monophyly on all fungal taxa even
where gene-based data supporting such a conclusion are unavailable or may be
unobtainable) (Hörandl & Stuessy 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@When a new teleomorph is discovered for a known anamorph, it will no
longer be possible to describe it in a new genus unless that species is proven
phylogenetically not to be congeneric with the type of the anamorph genus.
If the type species of a genus has not been studied by gene-based methods,
the genetic homogeneity of the genus cannot be proven. Similarly, no uniﬁcation
of anamorphs and teleomorphs can be forced if the type species of both the
anamorph and teleomorph genera have not been analysed.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Names of species#Misc-exposition*]

[@If the rule of priority were strictly applied to epithets in both teleomorphic
and anamorphic genera, many name changes would ensue unless a particular,
well-established name is ‘rescued’ by formal conservation. To avoid this, we
suggest a procedural rule for the committees (probably eventually for a new
article in the Code) that binomials established before July 31, 2011 for either
morph type must not be replaced by combining older epithets available in the
‘opposite’ morph (e.g., Trichoderma reesei should not become ‘T. jecorinum’ and
T. citrinoviride should not become ‘T. schweinitzii’ despite the older available
name Hypocrea schweinitzii). If Pleospora were retained over Stemphylium,
would the new combination ‘Pleospora botryosa’ then have to replace the
established but younger P. tarda? In parallel with the ICBN Art. 11.2, such a
rule would stipulate that priority applies only to names of the same rank or the
same prioritized genus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Another problem concerns species for which no sequence data are available.
Can they be recombined into the alternative morph’s genus or not? Would
they remain in limbo? After proving the linkage of the type species of both
anamorph and teleomorph genera, it would be better to combine all other
names from the suppressed genus into the prioritized genus to keep them#Misc-exposition*]

[@504 ... Gams & al.#Page-header*]
[@visible and usable, even if those types were never restudied by any means. If not,
they will be forgotten, any further revisions of them would halt, and homonyms
or synonyms might be created in the prioritized genus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Such issues are further complicated because innumerable older (and many
highly important) species were not typiﬁed when described or their type
specimens are lost; these taxa would require lecto-, neo-, and/or epitypiﬁcations
before drawing any gene-based taxonomic conclusions about their status. The
problems raised by so many fungi that were described from single collections
and that may be extremely rare or diﬃcult to re-collect again for DNA-based
studies are nothing less than a daunting impediment for the establishment of a
workable 1F=1N taxonomy.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Conclusions#Misc-exposition*]

[@A major aim of the one-fungus one-name policy was to simplify fungal
nomenclature. The question, however, remains: simpliﬁcation for whom? For
the convenience of present-day mycologists, it would be desirable not to change
the names of higher taxa. When in extreme cases an anamorph-generic name
replaces the type genus of teleomorph-based higher taxa (e.g., Hypocreales,
Hypocreaceae), we still remember the meaning of the higher taxon because
we are used to it. The situation becomes complicated for future generations,
however, who must deal with many previously teleomorph-based higher taxa
when the teleomorph genus is no longer in use; mycologists must then learn
that these names were based on a now-rejected nomenclatural practice and try
to understand the superseded taxonomies before they can apply the systematic
concepts that led to the current use of a name. The intended “simpliﬁcation”
imposed by the 1F=1N standard will thus not be achieved in a long-term
vision, and future mycologists will still need to understand the suppressed dual
nomenclature to deal with the historical literature. Moreover, many recently
introduced teleomorph-generic names do reﬂect improved phylogenetic
knowledge, although they will not successfully compete with the correlated
anamorph names; these names undoubtedly will retain their informative value
in naming clades and should not, therefore, be completely eliminated.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In a carefully balanced system of prioritization, future mycologists may
appreciate having the choice between either continuing to use the present
higher-rank taxon names or creating new anamorph-based names.#Misc-exposition*]
[@An essential, permanent remnant of the dual nomenclature will be the
need for listing all teleomorphic and anamorphic synonyms of a fungus in any
monographic treatment together with the typiﬁcations of all these names. It
will often be the case that more species were described under the suppressed
morph-generic name than in the oﬃcially recognized morph genus. In any case,
all these suppressed species will have to be re-studied before any new species can#Misc-exposition*]

[@Minimizing nomenclatural chaos after Art. 59 ... 505#Page-header*]

[@be described. This does not simplify future taxonomic work. Re-examination of
types must be possible any time, and this will involve morphological (including
ultrastructural), biochemical, and molecular approaches equally, all still subject
to improvement. Curiously, it is often more valuable to preserve teleomorphic
material of most ascomycetes in a herbarium than their anamorph which, if the
type is a dried agar culture, can display its properties only when reactivated in
culture.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In a uniﬁed nomenclature, fungi will continue to have complicated life
cycles displaying a teleomorph and one or more anamorphs, each with its
distinctive gene expression and biological and ecological role. Future students
of mycology will have to understand the concept of anamorph and teleomorph
to understand the biology of the fungus, even if all stages are encompassed
under a single name.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The ﬁrst paragraph of the Preamble of the ICBN contains an odd and
ominously predictive stipulation immediately before the sentence quoted
above: “The purpose of giving a name to a taxonomic group is not to indicate its
characters or history [our emphasis added], but to supply a means of referring
to it and to indicate its taxonomic rank.” It seems probable that few mycologists
who deal with pleomorphic fungi would appreciate the strict application
of such a stipulation. The nomenclaturally required consolidation of many
morphologically disparate teleomorphic and anamorphic forms and even genera
into single genera now required by the newly adopted standard of 1F=1N may
satisfy both the new Code and advocates of strict monophyleticism but this
process will create many signiﬁcantly large and diverse — but nomenclaturally
supported! — genera that will also be self-accreting mycological ‘black holes’.
The names of such ‘megataxa’ will bear no useful biological information
about their species. While this result will conform with the newly redeﬁned
(if artiﬁcial) sense of nomenclatural stability, it cannot be hailed as progress
toward biological or even taxonomic sensibility.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We should also note that the availability of cultures of hitherto unknown
fungal organisms is an absolute prerequisite for their future exploitation in
biotechnological applications. Fungi have historically been used for many
beneﬁcial purposes; curiously, the roots for the new concepts and changes
adopted in Melbourne seem to have been elaborated mainly for organisms that
were studied intensively for their diverse beneﬁcial or detrimental properties
— e.g., pathogenicity, production of mycotoxins or other primary or secondary
gene products, uses as biological control agents, or many other potential
concerns. We should realize that in view of future applications, we have so far
only dealt with the low-hanging fruits. Large-scale bioprospecting programs
are now under way, and potential uses for fungi are by no means restricted to
the traditional search for novel, badly needed antibiotics and other compounds#Misc-exposition*]

[@with potential utility in pharmaceutical or agrochemical indications. The search
for industrial enzymes and commodity chemicals for “White Biotechnology”,

e.g., by transfer of their genes into heterologous hosts where biotechnological
applications appear feasible.#Misc-exposition*]
