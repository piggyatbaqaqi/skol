[@Abstract — Dendrothele mangiferae, previously known only from the Mascarene Islands,
is reported for the ﬁrst time from Central America. It has been found in Costa Rica growing
on bark of living Terminalia catappa. A full description, line drawing, and colour photos are

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@A conspicuous corticioid species, Dendrothele mangiferae, has recently
been collected from Costa Rica on bark of living Terminalia catappa L.
(Combretaceae), a large tree naturally widespread in subtropical and tropical
zones of Indian and Paciﬁc Oceans and planted extensively throughout the
tropics. It constitutes the ﬁrst record from outside the Mascarene Islands of
Réunion and Mauritius (Boidin et al. 1996). Specimens are fully described and
illustrated. Additional comments on the generic placement and related species
are provided.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@For light microscopic studies, samples were mounted in 3% potassium hydroxide
(KOH), Melzer’s reagent (IKI), and 0.1% cotton blue in 60% lactic acid to determine
cyanophily of basidiospore walls. Line drawings were made with a camera lucida
attachment. Specimens are deposited in INB and SALA.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomata resupinate, orbicular at ﬁrst, then eﬀuse, adnate, white,
hymenial surface smooth, cracked when mature, margin abrupt. Hyphal
system monomitic, hyphae clamped, 2–4 µm wide, thin-walled, obscured by
the abundant crystalline encrustation. Dendrohyphidia ﬁlamentous, sinuous,
with few branches, clamped. Basidia suburniform at ﬁrst, then subcylindrical,
cyanophilous, 100–150 × 15–25 µm, basally clamped, with 4 long sterigmata
about 15–25 µm. Cystidia absent. Basidiospores subglobose, (22–)24–27 ×
22–25 µm, when immature and still attached to the sterigmata broadly ellipsoid,
seemingly smooth but minutely spinulose in Melzer’s reagent and cotton blue,
walls hyaline, slightly thickened, with a conspicuous blunt apiculus, faintly
cyanophilous, inamyloid, nondextrinoid.#Description*]
[@Habitat and distribution — Known from the Mascarene Islands growing
on trunks of Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae) and undetermined trees; and
from Costa Rica on bark of living Terminalia catappa on the Paciﬁc coastal
shore (Plate 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Plate 3. Habitat of Dendrothele mangiferae with Terminalia catappa trees

[@there are two additional species with spinulose basidiospores: Dendrothele
candida (Schwein.) P.A. Lemke, with globose basidiospores (13–)15–20 ×
(11–)13–16(–20) µm and clampless hyphae; and Dendrothele nivosa (Berk.
& M.A. Curtis ex Höhn. & Litsch.) P.A. Lemke, with subglobose to ovoid
basidiospores 16–24 × 14–17 µm and clamped hyphae. Phylogenetic studies
show that Dendrothele is a polyphyletic genus, and that D. nivosa seems not
to be closely related to other Dendrothele species, including the generic type,
D. papillosa Höhn. & Litsch. [= D. griseocana (Bres.) Bourdot & Galzin] (Karen
K. Nakasone, pers. comm.). Further studies are needed within Dendrothele
species with ornamented basidiospores to elucidate their phylogenetic
relationships.#Misc-exposition*]
