[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Parmulariaceae, including 34 genera of foliicolous biotrophic fungi, occurs
primarily in the Neotropics and Paleotropics (Inácio & Cannon 2008, Kirk et
al. 2008). The type genus of the family, Parmularia Lév. and its type species
P. styracis Lév., was described on Styrax ferrugineus (Léveillé1846), a plant
species endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado. For decades this family was set aside
with occasional contributions (Müller & von Arx 1973, von Arx & Müller 1975,
Barr 1987, Sivanesan 1970, Sivanesan & Hsieh 1989, Sivanesan et al. 1998).
Recently the type species of all accepted genera were re-examined, consolidating
our understanding of the family on the basis of morphological features (Inácio
2003, Inácio & Cannon 2003, 2008). Now a new species belonging to the genus
Hysterostomella, previously observed by Sales (2003) and Silva et al. (2006)
from the Brazilian Cerrado, is formally described and illustrated.
The revision by Inácio (2003) of Hysterostomella Speg., type species
H. guaranitica Speg., included a re-description of several species. The genus is
characterized by subcuticular internal stromata when host cells are incorporated
by the infective mycelium. Sometimes these structures are subepidermal,
connected to superﬁcial stromatic ascomata by peg-like or tubular hyphal
ﬁlaments. The discoid multilocular stromatic ascomata contain spherical
or elongate locules dispersed in various orientations (Inácio 2003, Inácio &
Cannon 2008). Hysterostomella is close to Cycloschizon Henn., which diﬀers by#Misc-exposition*]

[@308 ... Inácio & al.#Page-header*]
[@forming internal stromata that become erumpent via a column with a wart-like
expanded top containing locules distributed in complete or incomplete rings.
Dothidasteroma Höhn., also close to Hysterostomella, diﬀers mainly by forming
ﬂat internal stromata, never subepidermal, that connect to the superﬁcial
ascomata by either bundles of dark colored hyphae, or single hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Leaf samples of Connarus suberosus containing dark brown to black crustose fungal
structures were collected from diﬀerent areas of Cerrado in Parque National, Brasília.
These were pressed and dried for 3–4 days at ± 50°C, and deposited in the Mycological
Collection of the Herbarium UB. The leaves were observed under a stereomicroscope
to describe the lesions and location and characteristics of the fungal colonies. For the
morphological studies, each specimen was mounted on slides using lacto-glycerol/
cotton blue or glycerol KOH/basic phloxine, to observe the internal structures. Pieces
of the dried material containing stromata were re-hydrated for 4–12 h using an aqueous
solution containing 10% ethanol and 0.1% Tween-20. Then 7–15 μm thick sections
were produced using a freezing microtome (MICROM GMBH, HM 500 OM, Micron
Laborgeräte, Walldorf, Germany). A compound light microscope (Zeiss Ultraphot
III, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) was used for the photographic documentation
and to obtain morphometrical data. Pieces of leaves with one or more lesions showing
representative samples of fruiting bodies were examined with SEM after treatment in a
0.1 M sodium cacodylate buﬀer (pH 7.4) containing 2% glutaraldehyde for at least 24 h.
The samples were dehydrated in an increasing acetone concentration series (15%, 30%,
50%, 75%, 100%; 15 min per concentration). Leaf pieces were then dried at the critical
point before being covered by a thin layer of gold in a sputter coater for 2 min. Finally,
the samples were observed in a scanning electron microscope (Jeol, model JSM 840-A
E).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hysterostomella species has previously been recorded associated with members
of the Connaraceae. Among the species with re-examined type materials, only
H. tetracerae (Höhnel 1909) and H. gymnosporiae (Hansford 1947) have a
conidial anamorph similar to that found in H. connari. However both diﬀer
because their conidia have a clear hyaline median band. In the remaining species
there are no records of anamorphs. Spermogonia as shown in H. connari were
previously reported only in H. tetracerae, which, however, diﬀers additionally
by its larger ascomata (88–188 μm diam.), darker and easily discernible lower
ascomatal wall, and narrower asci. Hysterostomella gymnosporiae forms
more prominent ascomata (170–250 μm high) and more restricted internal
pseudostromata than H. connari.#Misc-exposition*]
