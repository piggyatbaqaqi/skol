[@Abstract — Fulvifomes cambodiensis sp. nov. is described and illustrated from Preah Vihear,
Cambodia. It produces perennial, pileate and solitary basidiomes with a concentrically
sulcate zonate pileal surface, homogeneous context, hymenial setae, and yellowish
acyanophilous basidiospores. The new species macroscopically resembles F. rimosus, which
diﬀers in lacking hymenial setae and having cyanophilous generative hyphae and slightly
smaller basidiospores. The macroscopically similar Fomitiporia hartigii is distinguished by
larger hyaline basidiospores and the absence of setae. Fulvifomes johnsonianus has abundant
hymenial setae and quite similar hyphal structure to F. cambodiensis, but its much smaller
basidiospores and eﬀused-reﬂexed to pileate basidiomes distinguish it from the new species
with pileate and ungulate basidiomes with cracked pileal surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@After Murrill (1914) segregated Fulvifomes Murrill (Hymenochaetaceae
Donk), typiﬁed by F. robiniae (Murrill) Murrill, from Phellinus Quél., many
mycologists did not accept his genus (Ryvarden & Johansen 1980, Gilbertson
& Ryvarden 1987, Ryvarden & Gilbertson 1994, Núñez & Ryvarden 2000),
although it was treated as a subgenus of Phellinus by Dai (1999). Recent molecular
phylogenetic analyses clearly support it as an independent genus closely related
to Auriﬁcaria D.A. Reid and Phylloporia Murrill (Wagner & Fischer 2002,
Larsson et al. 2006). Morphologically, while all three genera produce colored
basidiospores, the dimitic hyphal system of Fulvifomes distinguishes it from the
two monomitic genera (Dai 2010). Except for the dimitic hyphal system and
colored basidiospores, Fulvifomes species have few distinctive morphological
characters (Dai 2010).#Misc-exposition*]

[@During a study on wood-decaying fungi in Cambodia, an unknown
Fulvifomes species was discovered, which is here described and illustrated as
Fulvifomes cambodiensis. Morphological diﬀerences between F. cambodiensis
and other similar species according to Chinese materials are also noted.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The studied specimen was deposited at the herbaria of Guangdong Institute
of Microbiology (GDGM) and Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences (IFP). The microscopic procedure follows Dai (2010). Sections were studied at
magniﬁcation up to ×1000 using a Nikon Eclipse E 80i microscope and phase contrast
illumination. The variation in the size of the spores was presented by excluding 5%
of measurements from each end of the range, which were given in parentheses. The
abbreviations are used as follows: IKI = Melzer’s reagent, IKI– = negative in Melzer’s
reagent, KOH = 5% potassium hydroxide, CB = Cotton Blue, CB– = acyanophilous,
L = mean spore length (arithmetic average of all spores), W = mean spore width
(arithmetic average of all spores), Q = variation in the L/W ratios within the specimen
studied, and n = number of spores, hyphae or setae measured from given number of
specimens. Line drawings were made with the aid of a light tube. Special color terms
follow Anonymous (1969) and Petersen (1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomes: Perennial, pileate, ungulate, in section triquetrous, usually solitary,

cm, 15 cm wide and 8 cm thick at base; pileal surface deep reddish brown to
dark clay-buﬀ, glabrous, concentrically sulcate with wide zones, glabrous with
age, cracked to slightly rimose with age, margin obtuse. Pore surface yellowish
brown, sterile margin yellowish brown, up to 10 mm; pores round to angular,

13 mm thick. Tubes cinnamon, woody hard, tube layers distinct, annual layer

[@Remarks: Fulvifomes cambodiensis is macroscopically characterized by

[@and obtuse pileal margin. However, the basidiomes of F. rimosus are darker.
Microscopically, F. rimosus lacks hymenial setae and has slightly smaller
basidiospores (L = 5.54 μm, W = 4.54 μm) and cyanophilous generative hyphae
(Dai 2010).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The macroscopically similar Fomitiporia hartigii (Allesch. & Schnabl)
Fiasson & Niemelä shares with F. cambodiensis the perennial and ungulate
basidiomes with the concentrically sulcate cracked pileal surface, obtuse pileus
margin, and almost identical pore sizes (Dai 2010), making the two species
very hard to diﬀerentiate in the ﬁeld. But F. hartigii is distinguished by its wider
hyphae, lack of setae, and larger hyaline basidiospores that are dextrinoid and
strongly cyanophilous (Dai 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Fulvifomes johnsonianus (Murrill) Y.C. Dai has quite similar hyphal structure
to F. cambodiensis, and the two species also share abundant hymenial setae and
ellipsoid basidiospores (Q = 1.23, Dai 2010). However, F. johnsonianus has
much smaller basidiospores (2.8–3.2 × 2.2–2.6 µm; Dai 2010). Macroscopically,
F. johnsonianus has eﬀused-reﬂexed to pileate basidiomes, which are easily
diﬀerentiated from the pileate and ungulate basidiomes with cracked pileal
surface of F. cambodiensis (Dai 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
