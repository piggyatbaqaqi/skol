[@Abstract – Ramularia hypericicola, a rare anamorphic Mycosphaerella species, is reported
and illustrated from Turkey on Hypericum calycinum. The Turkish collection represents the
second report of this fungus, known hitherto only from the type locality.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words — symptoms, Clusiaceae, morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of Ramularia are phytopathogenic, causing leaf spots,
sometimes chlorosis, or without visible symptoms, occasionally saprobic
or hyperparasitic (Braun 1998). Bremer & Petrak (1947) published the ﬁrst
records of Ramularia species from Turkey, R. anatolica Bremer & Petr. and
R. helminthiae Bremer & Petr. Subsequent papers about Turkish microfungi,
including Ramularia species, were published by Bremer et al. (1948, 1952a,
1952b) and Petrak (1953, 1957). Additional Turkish records, of Ramularia
cynarae Sacc., R. onobrychidis Allesch., and R. sambucina Sacc., were published
by Karel (1958). The relatively small number (nearly 30 species) of Ramularia
species recorded in subsequent papers (Göbelez 1964) reﬂects a rather poor
degree of research on microfungi on plants in Turkey. However, during the
past two decades research on micromycetes (including hyphomycetes) in the
country has intensiﬁed (Altan & Tamer 1996, Hüseyinov & Selçuk 1999, Braun
et al. 2000, Hüseyin & Selçuk 2001, Hüseyinov et al. 2002, Hüseyin et al. 2003,
2005, Melnik et al. 2004, Erdoğdu & Hüseyin 2007, Selçuk et al. 2009, 2010).
We describe here one recent collection from Turkey of a Ramularia species
previously recorded only from Russia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The plant material was gathered from Gemlik (Bursa Province). The host plant was
identiﬁed by reference to Davis (1967). Sections of the fungus were hand cut using a
razor blade and microscopically examined using a Leica DM LB research microscope.
The fungus was identiﬁed following Braun (1998). Author abbreviations follow Index
Fungorum (2011). All examined specimens are deposited in the herbarium of Ahi
Evran University, Arts and Sciences Faculty, Department of Biology, Kırsehir Province,
Turkey.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

[@After careful comparison with Ramularia spp. described on hosts of
Hypericaceae based on Braun (1998) the recently collected material on
Hypericum calycinum from Turkey proved to be clearly identical with
R. hypericicola. The following description and illustration are based on the
Turkish material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On both surfaces of leaves causing subcircular to irregular, occasionally
angular and vein-limited, scattered sometimes conﬂuent spots, covers more
than 50% of the surface of some leaﬂet, ﬁrstly 0.5–1 mm across, then up to 10
mm diam. Spots on upper surface dirty brownish, dull, lover surface clearly#Description*]

[@A new host for Ramularia hypericicola (Turkey) ... 371#Misc-exposition*]

[@brown, without distinct margin. Caespituli hypophyllous, punctiform, grayish
white. Mycelium internal, colourless, hyphae septate, branched, formed
stromatic, colourless to yellowish-ochraceous, subglobose or slightly lengthened
hyphal aggregations in leaﬂet tissues, 15–70(–75) µm diam. Conidiophores in
small to moderately large fascicles, loose to usually dense, emerging through
stomata or erumpent through the cuticle, erect, simple, straight, subcylindrical
to geniculate-sinuous, continuous to sparingly septate, hyaline or subhyaline,
smooth, 6–65(–70) × 2.5–5 µm. Conidiogenous cells terminal, colourless,
enteroblastic. Conidiogenous scars thickened, darkened. Conidia colourless,
catenate, chains occasionally branched, produced enteroblastically, single
conidia smooth to faintly rough, ellipsoid-ovoid, subcylindrical, fusiform,
10–30(–35) × 4–5(–6) µm, unicellular or with a single median septa, not
narrower at the septa, ends rounded or somewhat attenuated.#Description*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1956, the Russian mycologist M.K. Khokhryakov collected a Hypericum
sp. with Ramularia-type sporulation in the Russian Far East, which he deposited
in LEP as Ramularia sp. Braun (1998: 170) described R. hypericicola as a new
species based on this material. Ramularia hypericicola is undoubtedly a rare
anamorph of Mycosphaerella. The present record from Turkey represents the
second collection of this species and the ﬁrst on a known host, Hypericum
calycinum.#Misc-exposition*]
