[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fischer (1898-99) established the order Phallales, initially composed of two
families, Clathraceae and Phallaceae, to separate representatives with branched
and unbranched basidiomata. Clathraceae, established by Chevallier (1826),
encompasses the “lattice stinkhorns”, fungi that exhibit a peculiar basidioma
featuring tubular or mucilaginous arms either interconnected or intertwined
in a network or comprising a receptacle with vertical arms either connected at
the top or arched in the shape of a star (Miller & Miller 1988). Pegler & Gomez
(1994) included twelve genera within the family (Blumenavia, Linderiella,
Pseudocolus, Anthurus, Aseroe, Lysurus, Clathrus, Ileodictyon, Simblum, Colus,
Neolysurus and Kalchbrennera).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Corda (1842) proposed Phallaceae for species with fruiting bodies
composed of a single, hollow receptacle with a foul-smelling gleba covering
the apex. Morphological characters widely used to separate genera include#Misc-exposition*]

[@420 ... Cabral & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@the presence of a campanula (head) at the apex of the receptacle in Phallus,
indusium in Dictyophora, and calyptra in Itajahya. Some genera lack a distinct
head and form the mucilaginous gleba directly on the apical receptacle (e.g.,
Mutinus) or at a constriction near the apex (e.g., Staheliomyces). Several
attempts were made to establish a synopsis of the family (Lloyd 1909, Fischer
1933), and Cunningham (1944) included seven genera: Dictyophora, Itajahya,
Phallus, Mutinus, Staheliomyces, Aporophallus, and Floccomutinus. However,
Kreisel (1996) viewed Dictyophora, Aporophallus, Itajahya, Echinophallus, and
Endophallus as subgenera of Phallus sensu lato, using the shape and surface
of the head, pigmentation of the receptacle, and morphology of the volva and
rhizomorphs as primary characteristics. He did not deem the presence of a pore
at the receptacle apex or the morphology of the head, indusium, and calyptra as
suﬃcient for segregation at the generic level (Kreisel 1996).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Taxonomic studies of Neotropical phalloid species have revealed new
and intriguing species (Baseia et al. 2003, Baseia & Calonge 2005, Fazolino
et al. 2010). The discovery of new species is essential to understanding the
evolutionary path of Phallales clades, since according to known estimates
(Hawksworth 2001, Mueller et al. 2007, Blackwell 2011), most tropical species
remain unknown. Through morphological data and molecular tools the
classiﬁcation of macrofungi should change in coming years.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The present study aims to evaluate the actual taxonomic position of Aseroe
ﬂoriformis and Phallus roseus, two species with distinct morphological features
that have not yet been analyzed by molecular studies.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Basidioma sampling#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomata were sampled at the Parque Estadual Dunas do Natal (06°22ʹ10ʺ S
and 35°00ʹ28ʺ W) and Estação Ecológica do Seridó (06°35ʹ02ʺ S and 37°17ʹ02ʺ W),
Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. Specimens of Aseroe ﬂoriformis and Phallus roseus
were photographed and collected during the rainy seasons in 2008 and 2009. Materials
studied were deposited in the fungal collection of the UFRN Herbarium.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Macroscopic characters were described from fresh specimens. Basidiomata colors
were based on Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). Microscopic characteristics were
determined from temporary mounts, hand-sectioned with a razor blade on the vertical
axis of the basidiomata and mounted in 3% KOH and 1% cotton-blue lactophenol,
respectively. All measurements were made under oil-immersion microscope objective
at 1000× magniﬁcation. Spore measurements included the largest and smallest spores
and at least 20 additional randomly selected spores from each specimen.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular techniques#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fresh basidiomata of Aseroe ﬂoriformis (UFRN 1481) and Phallus roseus (UFRN
535) were used for CTAB DNA extraction. The CTAB buﬀer (1.4M NaCl, 100mM TrisHCl pH 8.20mM EDTA and 2% CTAB) was added to 0.8g of fresh tissue pulverized#Misc-exposition*]

[@with liquid nitrogen and incubated for 30 min. at 65°C. After incubation, a chloroformisoamyl (24:1) extraction was performed, followed by isopropanol precipitation. Total
DNA amount was quantiﬁed on a NanoDrop-2000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies Inc. Wilmington, DE 1980, United States).#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA sequences were obtained for three diﬀerent regions: nuc-LSU-rDNA (LROR/
LR5), ATPase subunit 6 (ATP61/ATP62) and the second largest subunit of RNA
polymerase RPB2 (bRPB2-6F/bRPB2-7R), with previously designed primers (Vilgalys
1990; Liu et al. 1999; Kretzer & Bruns 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@All PCR reactions were carried out in a ﬁnal volume of 50µl, with PCR buﬀer 10X,
4 mM of MgCl2, 25 ng of DNA, 0.3 mM of dNTP Mix, 12.5 pmol of each primer and
0.3µl of Invitrogen® DNA Taq Polymerase (5U/µl). The initial cycling parameter for
atp6 reaction condition consisted of 2 min at 95°C for initial denaturation, 5 cycles of 35
s at 94°C, 55 s at 37°C and 1min at 72°C. This was followed by 30 cycles of 35 s at 94°C,
55 s at 45°C, 1 min at 72°C, and ﬁnal extension of 5 min at 72°C with ﬁnal hold of 4°C.
The nuc-LSU-rDNA ampliﬁcation condition underwent initial denaturation for 2 min
at 95°C, followed by 39 cycles for 1 min at 94°C, 30 s annealing at 45°C, 1 min extension
at 72°C, and a ﬁnal extension for 5min at 72°C. RPB2 ampliﬁcations followed conditions
described by Liu et al. (1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Amplicons were veriﬁed by ethidium bromide-stained 0.4% agarose gel
electrophoresis. Total amount of ampliﬁed DNA was quantiﬁed by a NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer. Ampliﬁcations with low DNA content were re-ampliﬁed by
increasing PCR cycles.#Misc-exposition*]
[@PCR products were puriﬁed with Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System
(Promega). The sequencing reaction was performed with a DNA sequencing kit
(BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit) using the same primers employed to
amplify each fragment, and sequencing was conducted an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). Both were carried out at the Center for Human Genome Studies
(University of São Paulo, CEGH-USP) and later assembled using DNA Baser v3.0.12
beta.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic analyses were performed for three combined DNA datasets under
Bayesian and parsimony criteria. Newly generated sequences for Aseroe ﬂoriformis and
Phallus roseus ATP6, nuc-LSU-rDNA and RPB2 and those retrieved from GenBank
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov – Table
1) were separately aligned using ClustalX2 (Larkin et al. 2007), with default settings
(alignment ﬁles are available at http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:
S11546). Manual adjustments were made in BioEdit v. 7.0.9.0 (Hall 1999). The three
alignments were then concatenated with Phyutility (Smith & Dunn 2008). Maximum
parsimony analyses were conducted with combined dataset ﬁle, in PAUP* (Phylogenetic
Analysis Using Parsimony) version 4b10 (Swoﬀord, 2002). Heuristic search was used with
tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) and MULTrees. Conﬁdence levels were established
through 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian analysis was carried out with combined
dataset in MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001). Two diﬀerent runs with
four incrementally heated simultaneous Monte Carlo Markov chains were conducted
over 2 million generations, applying respective substitution models determined for#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses produced no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in tree topology, indicating data consistency to resolve the
phylogeny of the group. The phylogram (Fig. 3) illustrates six well-formed
clades corresponding to the families of Phallales with high support values
(PP = 1, BT = 90–100). Intergeneric relationships in each family are also
shown. It was found that Aseroe ﬂoriformis does not cluster with Aseroe rubra,
and occupies a basal position in the Clathraceae, with PP = 1 and BT = 99.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In Phallaceae, Phallus roseus occupies a position between Mutinus elegans and

[@Our phylogenetic analyses conﬁrm high support values for Phallales in
accordance with Hosaka et al. (2007). Morphological and molecular analyses
supported the establishment of the genus Abrachium, named for its armless
receptacle (Fig 1). This taxon was originally described in the Brazilian Atlantic
rainforest (Baseia & Calonge 2005), but has since been recorded in northeastern
Brazil (Trierveiler-Pereira & Baseia 2009, 2011, Bezerra et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The clathraceous clade comprises members with a variable morphology of
the basidiomata, consisting of tubular or gelatinous arms either interconnected
or free (Dring 1980). The armless receptacle of Abrachium justiﬁes an
emendation in Clathraceae and seems to be a primitive characteristic of the
clade, as shown in the tree obtained by molecular inference (Fig. 3). Molecular
data indicate that receptacle morphology is a phylogenetically informative
characteristic in Clathraceae. In phylogram, Abrachium represents a basal
clade, which is a sister group of a clade formed by other Clathraceae species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The latter have a bifurcation leading to two other subgroups. The ﬁrst subgroup
either has arms attached at the ends [Pseudocolus fusiformis (E. Fisch.) Lloyd],
or free and arched like a star [Aseroe rubra and Anthurus archeri (Berk.) E.
Fisch.]. The second subgroup displays a complex structure, forming a “cage”

[@and Protubera canescens G. W. Beaton & Malajczuk. Based on these data,
we can infer that the evolution to receptacle bifurcation (forming arms, e.g.,
Aseroe) occurred at least once in the Neotropical region. Presumably, after the
divergence of A. ﬂoriforme, a common ancestor has diverged to forms where
the receptacle may bifurcate like arms in one group, and form a cage in the
other (such as Ileodictyon).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Molecular data analysis of Phallus roseus points to the need for reassessing
its current taxonomic status in the subgenus Itajahya proposed by Malençon
(1984) and Kreisel (1996). Itajahya was established by Möller (1895) based on I.
galericulata Möller, a taxon discovered in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The main
feature distinguishing Itajahya from other Phallaceae genera is the presence
of a structure called a calyptra (Fig. 2) located at the apex of the gleba (Möller
1895, Malençon 1953, Ottoni et al. 2010). Molecular data demonstrated that
P. roseus diverged after Mutinus and prior to other species of Phallus (Fig.

[@raising Itajahya to generic status. Further collections and molecular studies of
I. galericulata (= Phallus galericulatus (Möller) Kreisel) are also needed in order
to ensure morphological characteristics (mainly the presence of calyptra) agree
with molecular data recognizing the genus Itajahya.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular data also imply that the indusium is not a phylogenetically
informative character in Phallaceae. Malençon (1984) and Kreisel (1996)#Misc-exposition*]
[@stated that species may be closely related with or without this structure, and
that a species may or may not produce it or have a rudimentary form of it.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The phylogram indicates that although Dictyophora multicolor and D. duplicata
form a separate clade, D. indusiata clusters with Phallus hadriani, exhibiting
prior divergence with the other mentioned clade. This suggests that indusiate
species may have emerged independently during several phases of the group’s
evolution, thereby characterizing it as a polyphyletic assemblage. The phylogram
also illustrates that Mutinus is a more primitive genus in Phallaceae, as observed
by Cunningham (1944), based on data from simple sporophore morphology
and the absence of complex structures such as campanulate apex, indusium
and calyptra. It is important to note that further molecular studies are needed,
especially with key-taxa that may lead to a change in current classiﬁcation and
give us a clearer picture of the systematics and evolution of phalloid fungi.#Misc-exposition*]
