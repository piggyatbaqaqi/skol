Abstract — A new species, Corynesporella obclavata, is described and illustrated from dead
branches of Pistacia chinensis collected from tropical forests in Yunnan Province, China. A
synopsis of Corynesporella species is provided. Stephembruneria elegans and Diplococcium
pulneyense are recorded for the ﬁrst time from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Numerous fungi on wood have been discovered in tropical and subtropical
forests during recent research on the fungus ﬂora of South China (Dai et al.
2009, Dai & Li 2010, Ma et al. 2010, 2011). In our continuing study of conidial
fungi on dead wood, a hitherto undescribed species of Corynesporella and
two new records were found. These three species are described, illustrated,
and compared with similar species. The specimens are deposited in HSAUP
(Herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology, Shandong Agricultural
University) and HMAS (Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Stephembruneria was erected by Castañeda Ruíz (1988) to
accommodate a single species, S. elegans. Currently Stephembruneria
remains monotypic and is characterized by macronematous, mononematous
conidiophores, monophialidic, terminal, integrated, conidiogenous cells that
narrow to a slightly cupulate collarette at the apex, and solitary, euseptate,
navicular to fusiform, versicolored conidia. The type material diﬀers from our
material by its larger conidia (30–43 × 10–13 µm) and longer conidiophores
(250–350 μm). This is the ﬁrst record from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Diplococcium pulneyense is most similar to D. spicatum in conidial shape and
septation (Grove 1885), but D. spicatum can be distinguished by its smaller
conidia (6–9 × 3–4 μm). The type material diﬀers from the Chinese specimen
by its longer conidia (12–30 µm) and narrower conidiophores (3–5.5 µm). This
is a new record from China.#Misc-exposition*]
