[@Abstract — A dematiaceous fungus associated with trichomes on leaﬂets of Dimorphandra
mollis was collected during a survey of fungi associated with the genus Dimorphandra
(Fabaceae). The host tree is endemic to the Brazilian Cerrado. Although widely distributed
there, this plant has been neglected in mycological studies, since no fungus has ever been
recorded in association with it. The new fungus produces large alveariform (skep or beehiveshaped), muriform, dictyosporous, distoseptate, verruculose conidia from large, thickened,
dark washer-like conidiogenous loci. Among previously described anamorphic genera,
this fungus is somewhat similar to Annellophragmia, Annellosympodia, Briansuttonia,
Dictyospiropes, and Veracruzomyces as well as Spiropes dictyosporus but has some signiﬁcant
diﬀerences from those taxa. Hence, the new genus Alveariospora (type species: A. distoseptata
sp. nov.) is proposed for this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dimorphandra mollis Benth. (Fabaceae: faveira, faveiro-do-cerrado,
falso barbatimão) is a plant native to the Cerrado. This species is adapted to
conditions of low rainfall, developing foliage, ﬂowering, and fruiting in the wet
season and losing its leaves in the dry season (Lorenzi 2002). The fruits are
utilized to extract rutin and other glycoside ﬂavonoids for the pharmaceutical
industry (Ferreira et al. 2001; Lorenzi 2002). It has potential for exploitation as
a source of gum for the food industry (Panegassi et al. 2000). Although D. mollis
is a common component of the cerrado ﬂora — an ecosystem that in recent
decades has been intensively explored by Brazilian mycologists (e.g., Rezende
& Dianese 2003, Dornelo-Silva & Dianese 2004, Hernández-Gutiérrez &
Dianese 2009, Pereira-Carvalho et al. 2010) — no attention has been paid to the
mycobiota of this host plant and no fungi have ever been recorded on D. mollis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In July 2009, an exploratory survey of the mycodiversity of Dimorphandra spp.
was initiated, and the ﬁrst brief survey to the municipalities of Paraopeba and
Caetanópolis (Minas Gerais, Brazil) has already yielded several fungi of interest.
One interesting fungus, found colonizing D. mollis trichomes, is described and
discussed herein.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Samples of D. mollis foliage were collected, dried in a plant press, and taken to the
lab. After examination, selected leaﬂets bearing fungus colonies were deposited in the
local herbarium (Herbarium VIC). Isolations were attempted by direct spore transfer
onto plates containing VBA medium (Pereira et al. 2003) with the help of a ﬁne needle.
Fungal structures were removed from fresh leaves and mounted in lactophenol.
Observations, measurements, and illustrations were carried out with an OLYMPUS BX
51 light microscope ﬁtted with a digital camera (EVOLT E330) and a drawing tube.
Wherever possible, 30 measurements of each structure were taken.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — The pattern of ontogeny in Alveariospora can be classiﬁed as
conidial development type 17 (Kirk et al. 2008) (holoblastic, delimitation by 1
septum, schizolytic secession, maturation by diﬀuse wall-building, percurrent
enteroblastic conidiogenous cell extension, followed by conidial ontogeny by
replacement apical wall-building; strongly melanized, each successive conidium
seceding before the next percurrent elongation of the conidiogenous cell), but
sometimes also holoblastic, sympodial proliferation occurring and two or more
conidia are produced, a pattern of ontogeny classiﬁed as conidial development
type 10 (holoblastic, regularly alternating with sympodial proliferation,
maturation by diﬀuse wall-building and secession schizolytic).
The mode of rectilinear proliferation and the combination of conspicuous
annular structures and thickened, darkened conidiogenous loci in Alveariospora
distoseptata is very unusual and comparable only with Annellophragmia Subram.
(Ellis 1971), Annellosympodia McTaggart et al. (McTaggart et al. 2007), and
Spiropes dictyosporus Seifert & S. Hughes (Seifert & Hughes 2000). However,
the last species, inhabiting a sooty mould in New Zealand, is characterized
by synnematous conidiomata and euseptate conidia. Annellophragmia is
diﬀerentiated by synnematous conidiomata and phragmosporous (but also
distoseptate) conidia. Annellosympodia is characterized by its sporodochial#Description*]
