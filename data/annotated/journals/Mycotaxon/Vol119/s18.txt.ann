[@Abstract — Remototrachyna sipmaniana is described as new to science, and three new
combinations, R. aguirrei, R. consimilis, and R. singularis, are proposed. Ten Hypotrachyna
and two Remototrachyna species are reported as new to Bolivia, including the southernmost
localities of H. halei and H. partita, the ﬁrst record of H. primitiva from the southern
hemisphere, and the second locality for H. neoscytodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Parmeliaceae Zenker (Lecanorales, Lecanoromycetes) is a large family of
Ascomycota consisting of foliose, fruticose or rarely crustose lichens, but also
lichenicolous non-lichenized taxa (e.g. Elix 1993, Lumbsch & Huhndorf 2007,
Peršoh & Rambold 2002). It is believed to be one of the richest in species within
the phylum and comprises about 1500 species (Blanco et al. 2006). This group
has been extensively investigated by several researchers for more than 50 years,
so the worldwide distribution of many taxa is well known. However, some areas,
especially in the tropics, need further study; one of these is Bolivia. Data on
Parmeliaceae from this country are not numerous and are mostly included in
monographic treatments (e.g. Hale 1965, 1975, 1976; Culberson & Culberson
1981, Nash et al. 1995, Sipman et al. 2009) or rarely ﬂoristic papers (e.g. Herzog
1922, Feuerer & Sipman 2005).#Misc-exposition*]

[@158 ... Flakus, Rodriguez Saavedra & Kukwa#Page-header*]
[@During several lichenological expeditions to Bolivia we have collected more
than 20,000 specimens and, in addition, further samples have been obtained
on loan from several herbaria. Among the macrolichens, a large proportion
were representatives of Parmeliaceae. This is the ﬁrst paper dealing with
new distributional data for Parmeliaceae in Bolivia. Here we report a new
species and records for two morphologically similar, but phylogenetically
distant genera, Hypotrachyna (Vain.) Hale and Remototrachyna Divakar &
A. Crespo. Additionally, we propose transferring three additional species from
Hypotrachyna to Remototrachyna based on anatomical features.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The material studied is deposited in B, KRAM, LPB, UGDA and herb. Flakus.
Additional specimens from B, TUR-Vain and TNS were investigated for comparison.
Lichen substances were studied by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using the methods
of Culberson & Kristinsson (1970) and Orange et al. (2001). Spot-test reactions with
C, K and P were applied to determine the location of secondary metabolites in some
specimens.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The genus Hypotrachyna in the Neotropics, including some species of Remototrachyna,
has recently been revised by Sipman et al. (2009), so the descriptions and secondary
chemistry of the species are not repeated here. The characteristics of many taxa can also
be found in Hale (1975).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results#Misc-exposition*]
[@The genus Hypotrachyna#Misc-exposition*]

[@The diagnostic characters of the genus include the dichotomously or
subdichotomously branched lobes with truncate apices, bifusiform conidia,
sparsely to richly dichotomously branched rhizines, and an outer exciple
consisting of plectenchyma with thin cell walls (Crespo et al. 2010, Divakar et
al. 2010). In its current circumscription the genus is paraphyletic (see Blanco
et al. 2006, Divakar et al. 2006, Crespo et al. 2010) and needs further study
for a better understanding of its relationship to other morphologically similar
genera, e.g., Everniastrum Hale ex Sipman, Parmelinopsis Elix & Hale.
Recently the genus Remototrachyna was segregated from Hypotrachyna
basing mainly on the structure of the cupulate excipulum (plectenchymatous
with very thick-walled cells) and genetic diﬀerences (Divakar et al. 2010).
During our study we investigated several fertile specimens of Hypotrachyna
from the Neotropics, and in three species, H. aguirrei, H. consimilis and
H. singularis, the excipulum appeared typical for Remototrachyna; thus those
taxa are transferred to Remototrachyna (see below).#Misc-exposition*]
[@We also observed that the plectenchyma in the cupulate exciple of
Hypotrachyna can have thicker cell walls than presented by Divakar et al.
(2010), but cell lumina are more or less rounded or ellipsoid, never elongated#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Remototrachyna#Misc-exposition*]

[@This genus is morphologically very similar to Hypotrachyna but diﬀers in
having a scleroplectenchymatous cupulate exciple, broad, subirregular lobes
with rounded apices, short, mostly dichotomously branched rhizines, a high
hymenium, and large ellipsoid ascospores; it is distantly related genetically to
Hypotrachyna (Divakar et al. 2010). In the course of this study we observed
larger variability in exciple structure of Hypotrachyna than reported by Divakar
et al. (2010). The cells can have thicker walls than previously reported, but in
Remototrachyna the hyphae are much more thick-walled, with very elongated,
thin, and linear to sigmoid cell lumina, which are usually almost vertically
orientated.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Basing on anatomical and morphological characters, four additional
species were recognized, one new and three transferred from Hypotrachyna
(see below). Probably more Hypotrachyna members should be transferred to
Remototrachyna, but further investigations of fertile material are needed.
According to Divakar et al. (2010), the ancestral range of Remototrachyna
was restricted to India. In the light of the new results the genus has a much wider
distribution and is more diverse in the Neotropics than previously supposed.
Possibly, the ancestral origins of Remototrachyna should be reevaluated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — Remototrachyna sipmaniana is distinguished from all other
species of the genus by the abundant, branched cilia. However, the structure
of the cupulate exciple and the general morphology agree with the diagnostic
characters of Remototrachyna.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The species shows considerable variation in the production of isidia. In the
holotype they are very abundant on the thallus as well as on the apothecial
margin, but in the paratypes isidia are less frequent; in some thalli they are
sparse and many apothecia are not isidiate.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Remototrachyna sipmaniana is also distinguished by the production of
protocetraric acid in the medulla of the thallus, isidia and apothecial margin
whereas gyrophoric acid is restricted to the cortex of the isidia. Three other
isidiate species of Remototrachyna, R. incognita (Kurok.) Divakar & A. Crespo,
R. consimilis and R. koyaensis (Asahina) Divakar & A. Crespo are chemically
similar, but diﬀer in other characters. Remototrachyna incognita contains
gyrophoric acid, but together with protolichesterinic acid (Divakar & Upreti
2005), whereas R. sipmaniana produces protocetraric and gyrophoric acids; the
former occurs in Asia (Divakar & Upreti 2005), while the latter occurs in the
Neotropics.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Both R. consimilis and R. koyaensis contain protocetraric acid (e.g., Hale
1975, Divakar & Upreti 2005, Sipman et al. 2009), and although gyrophoric acid
has been detected in some specimens in minor or trace amounts, the reaction
with C has been always reported as negative (Louwhoﬀ & Elix 2002, Sipman et
al. 2009). Remototrachyna consimilis has very similar ascospore dimensions to
R. sipmaniana (see Sipman et al. 2009), but it diﬀers by having much narrower
lobes, (0.5–)1–2(–3) mm wide, and partly yellow-pigmented lower medulla
(Sipman et al. 2009). Remototrachyna koyaensis can be readily separated by
the production of caperatic acid (absent in R. sipmaniana) and the ascospore
size (9.5–11 × 5.5–6 μm in R. sipmaniana; versus more than 14 μm long and
7 μm wide in R. koyaensis) (Louwhoﬀ & Elix 2002, Divakar & Upreti 2005,
Sipman et al. 2009, sub Hypotrachyna). Additionally, they diﬀer in distribution:
R. koyaensis occurs in Asia, Papua New Guinea and in Mexico (Louwhoﬀ &
Elix 2002, Sipman et al. 2009), whereas R. sipmaniana occurs in Bolivia. We
examined the types of Parmelia consimilis and P. koyaensis and did not detect#Misc-exposition*]

[@gyrophoric acid by TLC nor did the isidia react with C. Possibly gyrophoric
acid is a relatively rare accessory substance in R. consimilis and R. koyaensis, but
the chemical variability needs to be studied in more collections.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the Neotropics R. sipmaniana could be also confused with two other
isidiate species, R. costaricensis (Nyl.) Divakar & A. Crespo and R. rhabdiformis
(Kurok.) Divakar & A. Crespo. However, both have alternative chemistry, the
former produces fatty acids and the latter norstictic, salazinic and consalazinic
acids (Sipman et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The new species could also be mistaken for some chemically similar isidiate
species of Hypotrachyna, but they do not contain major quantities of both
protocetraric and gyrophoric acids in the same thallus, nor are they distributed
