[@Abstract — Two species of Marasmius sect. Hygrometrici from South Korea are published
in this paper. Descriptions based on morphological characteristics and illustrations are
provided. Marasmius crescentiae is a new record for the studied region, and “M. junipericola”
represents a provisional new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@This new paper in a series on marasmioid and gymnopoid fungi collected
in the Republic of Korea (South Korea, Antonín et al. 2009, 2010a,b,c, 2011)
covers species of sect. Hygrometrici. A provisional new taxon, “Marasmius
junipericola” is described based on its very distinct macro- and microscopic
characteristics. However, we do not formally publish a new name because there
was too little material for molecular sampling. Marasmius crescentiae is recorded
as new to Korea. We provide ITS and LSU sequences of three specimens of
M. crescentiae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Macroscopic descriptions of collected specimens are based on fresh basidiocarps
collected by the ﬁrst author. Colour abbreviations follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1983),
herbarium abbreviations are according to Holmgren & Holmgren (1998). Authors of
fungal names are cited according to the International Plant Names Index Authors website
(http://www.ipni.org/ipni/authorsearchpage.do). Microscopic features are described#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA extraction, PCR ampliﬁcation, DNA sequencing, and phylogeny tree
construction methodologies followed Antonín et al. (2010a). New GenBank accession
numbers are listed in Table 1. The Bayesian-based ITS phylogeny used the general
time reversible (GTR) model with gamma-distributed substitution rates (Ronquist &
Huelsenbeck 2003). Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, saving one tree
every 100th generation and discarding the ﬁrst 1000 trees. This MCMC tree was used
to compute a 50% majority rule consensus of the remaining trees to obtain estimates
for the posterior probabilities (PPs) of the groups. The dataset includes M. crescentiae
and M. micraster (both from sect. Hygrometrici), with the type species of Marasmius,
M. rotula, selected as outgroup.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — The South Korean collections of M. crescentiae are characterized
by small basidiocarps, a sulcate light brown to brownish orange pileus, rather
large basidiospores, tetrasporic basidia, cheilocystidia of two types, absent or
scattered pleurocystidia, present pileocystidia, absent caulocystidia, and present
clamp connections. Although Singer (1976) observed smaller basidiospores
(6.5 × 2.7 μm), Desjardin & Horak (1997) cited larger basidiospores (7.5–8.5 ×
3.5–4.0 μm).#Misc-exposition*]

by the presence of well-developed caulocystidia. Although it represents a
