[@Abstract—Recent searches in Brazil for plant pathogens with potential for use as classical
biocontrol agents of Macfadyena unguis-cati yielded ﬁve fungal species, two previously
undescribed. These are described herein and preliminary evaluations based on ﬁeld and
laboratory observations of the diseases with which they are associated are given. These are:
Guignardia mangiferae (leaf spots), Meliola herteri (black mildew), Passalora macfadyenae
sp. nov. (leaf spots), Pseudocercospora unguis-cati (leaf spots) and Prospodium macfadyenae
sp. nov. (rust). The two newly described species, Pa. macfadyenae and Pr. macfadyenae, are
regarded as having the greatest potential for use in classical biological control.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Invasion of natural ecosystems by exotic species represents one of the biggest
threats to biodiversity, as now acknowledged by scientists and governments
throughout the world (IUCN 2000). Once an alien organism has invaded, the
sole long-term sustainable management alternative available for mitigating it
through human intervention is the introduction of natural enemies collected
in the pest’s centre of origin in a process known as classical biological control.
Macfadyena unguis-cati (L.) A.H. Gentry (Bignoniaceae) — common name
cat’s claws (in Brazil: unha-de-gato, unha-de-morcego) — is a woody vine that
has a broad distribution in its native range occurring from southern Brazil
and Argentina to Mexico (Everett 1980). Macfadyena unguis-cati takes its
popular names from the tendrils, which have acute divided ends that appear
and function like claws, allowing the plant to ﬁrmly attach to trees or other
supports on which it grows (Plate 1). At maturity it produces abundant showy
yellow ﬂowers making it a useful ornamental plant for cultivation on fences#Misc-exposition*]

[@182 ... Silva, Barreto & Pereira#Page-header*]
[@and garden walls (Lorenzi & Souza 1995). Because of its value as an ornamental
it was introduced to regions outside its native range, where it escaped from
gardens to become a noxious invader of native forests, particularly in the USA,
Australia, China, and South Africa (Henderson 1995, FLEPPC 2005, Williams
et al. 2008, Osunkoya et al. 2009, Dhileepan et al. 2010). Its vigorous vine habit
allows it to ascend tall trunks reaching the treetops (Plate 2) branching and
spreading over top of the forest canopy. The combination of the biomass weight
and shading of underlying vegetation can be very harmful and even cause the
death of the largest plants in infested areas and suppress the development of
smaller plants and seed germination of native plants (Neser 1996, Huang et al.
2009, King & Dhileepan 2009). In Florida, M. unguis-cati is listed as a Category
1 weed, a rank reserved for species capable of altering plant communities
by substituting and even permanently changing the natural structure of an
ecosystem and its ecological functions (FLEPPC 2005). Between 2003 and
2005 a search was conducted in native situations in Brazil for fungal pathogens
attacking M. unguis-cati that might have potential as biocontrol agents. This
publication presents the results of this preliminary survey with particular
reference to fungal taxonomy and the potential to use mycobiota in classical
biological control.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Prior to the ﬁeld survey, herbarium records were completely searched for occurrence
and distribution of M. unguis-cati in the following Brazilian herbaria: Herbário
Fanerogâmico e Criptogâmico do Instituto Agronômico (IAC); Herbário Maria Eneyda P.
K. Fidalgo (SP); Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro (RB); Herbário
do Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro (R); Universidade Federal de Viçosa (VIC); Museu
Botânico Municipal (MBM); and Herbário José Badini (OUPR). Using this information,
we prepared an itinerary for surveying the southern and southeastern Brazilian states
Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio
Grande do Sul. Surveys were conducted between January 2003 and December 2005.
Selected sites were visited and carefully scrutinized for the presence of M. unguis-cati.
For details on the general survey and laboratory methodologies see Barreto & Evans
(1994). Freshly collected samples were examined under a stereomicroscope. Slides
containing free-hand sections of colonized tissues or fungal structures scraped from
the surface of infected tissues were mounted in lactophenol or lactofuchsin. Isolations
of non-biotrophic fungi were attempted by directly transferring spores or other fungal
structures to plates containing Vegetable Broth Agar (VBA, Pereira et al. 2003), under a
dissecting microscope with a sterilized ﬁne point needle. Observations, measurements,
photographs and line drawings were prepared using an Olympus BX 50 light microscope
ﬁtted with a camera (Olympus Evolt SC 50) and drawing tube.#Misc-exposition*]

Meliola thaxteri Hansf., M. bidentata Cooke, and M. herteri (Hansford 1961).
The morphology of the specimen collected on M. unguis-cati during the survey
clearly placed this fungus within M. herteri as described by Hansford (1961).
Meliola herteri has been previously recorded on M. unguis-cati in Paraguay,
Amphilophium vauthieri DC. in Argentina, and Parabignonia maximilianii
(Mart ex DC.) Bureau in Brazil (Hansford 1961). This is the ﬁrst report of M.
herteri on M. unguis-cati in Brazil. Meliola herteri is, as are the Meliolaceae in
general, a weak obligate biotroph and the black mildew diseases the family
causes do not signiﬁcantly aﬀect their hosts (Hansford 1961). This fungal group
therefore has little relevance for use in biological control.#Misc-exposition*]

[@speciﬁcity (and thus ﬁt well into the safety requirements needed for classical
introductions). Therefore, we regard the prospects for its use in biocontrol of
M. unguis-cati as very good. Although U. rickiana has not been collected during
the surveys in southern and southeastern Brazil, it is likely that this species also
has potential as a biological control agent in warmer equatorial areas where
M. unguis-cati occurs as an invasive plant. It has the same favorable features
described for P. macfadyenae and causes a severe disease on its host producing
conspicuous galls on stems as illustrated in Hernández & Hennen (2003).
Ideally, further investigations involving additional surveys and a more detailed
evaluation of the potential biocontrol agents already uncovered are needed.
These could yield additional candidates for use in classical biological control
of M. unguis-cati and help pave the way towards introducing Pseudocercospora
unguis-cati, Passalora macfadyenae and Prospodium macfadyenae into exotic
situations where invasions by cat’s claws are under way, contributing to the
mitigation of the environmental damage caused by this important invasive
