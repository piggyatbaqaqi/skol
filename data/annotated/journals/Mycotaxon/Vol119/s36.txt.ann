[@Abstract —Two new species of Terriera are described and illustrated from Yunnan Province,
China. Terriera rotundata on leaves of Quercus sp. is recognized by its more or less circular
ascomata in vertical section. Terriera petrakii on Smilax bracteata is similar to Lophodermium
camelliicola but diﬀers from the latter by the pale conidiomata and ellipsoidal conidia and the
well-developed textura prismatica between the covering and the basal stroma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Terriera B. Erikss. was ﬁrst segregated from Lophodermium
Chevall. based mainly on paraphyses swollen at the tip to form an
epithecium and the lack of lip cells (Eriksson 1970). Johnston (1988, under
L. multimatricum; 1989, under L. minus) considered ascomatal development
and structure as important features for Terriera. Molecular analyses support
Terriera as monophyletic (Ortiz-García et al. 2003, Lantz et al. 2011). Many
Lophodermium species with ascomatal structures typical of Terriera have been
transferred to Terriera (Johnston 2001, Ortiz-García et al. 2003). Of the 18
species recognized worldwide, only two species have been reported for China
(Fröhlich & Hyde 2000, Yang et al. 2011). We describe here two new species of
Terriera from Yunnan Province, China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Hand sections of diﬀerent thickness of ascomata were prepared using a razor
blade and mounted in water, Melzer’s reagent, 5% KOH, or 0.1% (w/v) cotton blue in
lactic acid. For the observation of ascomatal outlines in vertical section, sections were
pretreated in water before being mounted in lactic acid or cotton blue. Gelatinous
sheaths surrounding ascospores and paraphyses were observed in water or cotton blue.
Ascospore contents were drawn based on observations in water mounts. Measurements#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascomata developing on fallen leaves, epiphyllous, occasionally hypophyllous,
not associated with bleached, pale brown areas. Ascomata (450−)600−900
× 330−450 µm, elliptical but often strongly curved at maturity, occasionally
triangular, young ascomata more or less elliptical in outline, black, shiny, with
a blurred margin, both ends rounded and often with pale spots, the central part
of the ascomata strongly raising above the surface of the substrate, opening
by a longitudinal split or occasionally by teeth. Immature, unopened ascomata
macroscopically visible as two black areas separated from each other by a
broad, pale longitudinal zone. In median vertical section, ascomata 140−180
µm deep in the host tissue, more or less circular in section. Covering stroma
consistently 28−35 µm thick, composed of an outer layer of host cuticle,
epidermal and hypodermal cells ﬁlled with dark brown, thick-walled fungal
cells 2−3 µm diam., and an inner layer formed by 3−4 rows of hyaline, thinwalled, angular cells. Horizontal portion of the covering stroma 20−30 µm
long, 10−25 µm thick, composed of periphysoids arising from the inner part
of the covering stroma, their tips forming a hard black crust. A triangular
space in section between the covering stroma and the basal stroma is ﬁlled
with vertically arranged rows of prismatic, hyaline to slightly brown, thinwalled cells 6−9 × 3−5 µm. Basal stroma medium to well-developed, ± ﬂat,
composed of brown to dark brown textura globulosa-angularis, 15−20 µm thick.
Excipulum and Lip cells absent. Subhymenium 6−10 µm thick, composed
of small cells 2−3 µm diam. Paraphyses 120−140 × 1 µm, ﬁliform, septate
or aseptate, unbranched, slightly swollen at the apex, embedded in gelatinous
sheaths. Asci ripening sequentially, 90−120 × 4−5.5 µm, narrow-cylindrical,
thin-walled, J−, without circumapical thickening, discharging spores through a
small apical hole, 8-spored. Ascospores fasciculate, 70−90(−95) × 0.8−1 µm,
ﬁliform, hyaline, aseptate, with numerous guttules, gelatinous sheaths not seen.
Liberated ascospore often strongly bent.#Description*]

[@Comments — Terriera rotundata is distinctive within the genus because of its
more or less globular ascomata in vertical section. The developmental pattern in
T. rotundata is similar to that of T. minor (Tehon) P.R. Johnst. in vertical section
with the textura prismatica between covering and basal stroma composed of
vertically oriented cells (Johnston 1988, 1989, 2001). However, the shelflike ridge along ascomatal opening typical of Terriera is poorly developed in
T. rotundata. In addition, liberated ascospores of T. rotundata are often strongly
bent and lack gelatinous sheaths.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — The ascomatal structure of Terriera petrakii is very similar to that
of T. minor, which diﬀers in shorter, uncurved ascomata, broader 0−1-septate
ascospores, a less well developed excipulum, and an unknown anamorph.
The conidioma shape and structure and ascospore shape in T. petrakii are
very similar to those of Lophodermium camelliicola Minter (which should
be transferred to Terriera). That species diﬀers in producing black instead of
pale conidiomata, cylindrical to ellipsoidal conidia, a less developed textura
prismatica between the covering and basal stroma, and its habit on Camellia
sinensis (L.) Kuntze. The herbarium specimen W 618 (labelled by Petrak as
“Lophodermium smilacinum Petr. n. sp.”, but never described), with a structure
typical of Terriera, is somewhat similar to T. petrakii but occurs on twigs, has
narrower and more conﬂuent ascomata, and lacks an anamorph.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ascomata of Terriera petrakii often occur together with Hypoderma
smilacicola C.L. Hou & M. Piepenbr. and Coccomyces occultus Y.L. Lin & Z.Z.
