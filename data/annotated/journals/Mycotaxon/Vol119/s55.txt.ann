[@Abstract—Volvariella sathei sp. nov., collected from Agharkar Research Institute Campus,
Pune, is described, illustrated, and compared with morphologically closely related taxa of
Volvariella and Volvopluteus. Diagnostic characters of the new species are the large white
fruitbodies, relatively small basidiospores, and cylindric-clavate pleuro- and cheilocystidia.
Neighbour-Joining analysis based on ITS sequences conﬁrmed that it is distinct from its
closest relative, V. nivea and other morphologically similar Volvariella species. A key to the
Indian species of Volvariella and Volvopluteus is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Volvariella Speg. (Agaricales) is well represented in India, and considerable
work has been carried out by Pathak et al. (1978) and Pradeep et al. (1998), who
have studied the genus and described and/or reported several species for the
country. Agaric checklists compiled by Manjula (1983), Natarajan et al. (2005),
and Kumaresan (unpublished list) cite 22 species of Volvariella including
Volvopluteus Vizzini et al. as reported from India. A white agaric from Pune
is here described as a new Volvariella species based on its morphological
and molecular characters. Its phylogenetic position has been determined by
ITS1+5.8S rDNA+ITS2 sequence analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Thin handmade sections were made from dried specimens, revived in 10% KOH, and
stained in 2% Phloxine. The microscopical characters were studied using an Olympus
U-CMAD3 microscope. Approximately 30 basidiospores from sections were measured;
the range (extreme values in parentheses) precedes mean spore measurements (in
parentheses). Camera lucida diagrams were made using Nikon E200 attached with
Nikon Y-IDT prism. Colour terminology follows Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). The
type specimen is deposited at Ajrekar Mycological Herbarium (AMH), MACS’ Agharkar
Research Institute, Pune, India.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA isolation methodology followed Aljanabi & Martinez (1997) with slight
modiﬁcations. ~300 mg of the holotype gills was washed thoroughly with 99% ethanol
and water. DNA was extracted using high salt extraction buﬀer (NaCl, Tris. HCl and
EDTA) and addition of one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1)
and ﬁnally precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and suspended
in Tris-EDTA buﬀer. The protocol outlined by White et al. (1990) was followed for
polymerase chain reaction in Eppendorf Master cycler (Eppendorf, Germany) with
universal primers ITS5 and ITS4. Sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystem, UK) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
The cleaned PCR product was run on ABI 3100 automated DNA sequencer. The raw
sequences obtained from ABI sequencer were manually corrected for inconsistencies
with the help of Chromas lite software. The DNA sequences obtained in Fasta format
were subjected to BLASTn (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) analysis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@For phylogenetic analysis, additional related sequences obtained from NCBI DNA
sequence database (Table 1) were aligned by CLUSTAL W to generate a phylogenetic
tree using MEGA v.5.0 software (Neighbour-joining using Kimura-2 parameter model).
The outgroup comprised Schizophyllum commune and Volvopluteus spp. (recently
transferred from Volvariella).#Misc-exposition*]

earlei f. acystidiatus (N.C. Pathak) Vizzini & Contu (Justo et al. 2011).
Of the 20 species described from India, two belong in Volvopluteus
(Vp. gloiocephalus (DC.) Vizzini et al. and Vp. earlei (Murrill) Vizzini et al.),
and the remaining species belong in Volvariella. Volvariella sathei is compared
here with morphologically similar taxa belonging to both genera.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Volvopluteus earlei, which also produces white basidiomata, diﬀers in smaller
(3–5 cm diam.) size and longer (>11 µm) spores (Justo & Castro 2010; Justo et al.
2010). Volvopluteus earlei f. acystidiatus, originally described by Pathak (1975)
and later by Vizzini & Contu (2010), also closely resembles V. sathei but clearly
diﬀers by its smaller (20–30 mm diam.) yellowish tinged pileus with pinkish
margin, shorter more slender stipe (30–40 × 2–3 mm), larger spores (10.5–16.5
× 7.5–10.5 µm) and basidia (45–70 × 10–13.5), and absence of hymenial cystidia
(Justo et al. 2010). Phylogenetically Volvopluteus species are clearly distant from
Volvariella species, including V. sathei. There are certain regions within ITS
including 5.8S that distinguishes Volvariella from Volvopluteus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Volvariella sathei is similar to Volvariella pusilla (Pers.) Singer (Pegler 1977,
1983, as V. parvula) in the white basidiomata with ﬁbrillose pileus and remote
lamellae. However, V. pusilla diﬀers in stature with smaller pilei (1.5–3 cm
diam.) and stipes (10–40 × 2–4 mm) as well as producing smaller basidia (17–29
× 5–7.5 µm), pleurocystidia (36–53 × 11–17 µm), and cheilocystidia (25–40 ×
9–16 µm).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Volvariella nivea T.H. Li & Xiang L. Chen described from China (Li et al.
2009) also produces large, white basidiomata but clearly diﬀers in slightly larger
ovoid to broadly ellipsoid spores and considerably larger cheilo- (50–150 ×
20–46 µm) and pleurocystidia (60–132 × 19–44 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

Dennis, V. hypopithys (Fr.) Shaﬀer, V. liliputiana (Henn.) G.C. Rath, and
V. delicatula (Massee) Manjula are also similar to V. sathei. However,
V. bombycina is lignicolous, and the spores are larger (7.3–9.4 µm in V.
bombycina; 6–7.5 µm in V. bombycina var. microspora). Volvariella hypopithys
has smaller basidiomes (pileus ≤ 5 cm diam.) with squamulose pilei and hairy
stipes, while Volvariella liliputiana and V. delicatula are much smaller (pileus
5–30 mm diam.) than V. sathei.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The 5.8S region was almost perfectly aligned, but numerous gaps (indels) and
misalignments among Volvariella species were observed in ITS1 and ITS2
regions. All analysed Volvariella species were divided into two main clusters
(I and II, Plate 3), with V. sathei, V. nivea, and V. taylorii together in subclade Ia.
Although V. sathei and V. nivea, both characterized by pure white basidiocarps,
are placed together with a strong (96%) bootstrap support, the branch lengths
show considerable sequence divergence between them. Our analysis places the
two sequences of Volvariella volvacea (HM246500.1, TO AV143; HQ999973.1,
ATCC MYA-4696) far apart (in completely two diﬀerent clusters), suggesting
ambiguity in deposited sequences.#Misc-exposition*]
[@As Li et al. (2009) has indicated for V. nivea, we noted a high degree of
variability (including considerable misalignment and several indels) throughout
the ITS 1 and ITS 2 regions among Volvariella species, but the 5.8S region
remained conserved with relatively few changes.#Misc-exposition*]
