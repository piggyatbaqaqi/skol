[@Abstract — Sixteen type and some additional specimens representing ﬁfteen species
assigned to Helvella were studied with the aim of providing new data for their improved
delimitation and recognition. Specimens were received on loan from DAOM, FH, H, K, MA,
MICH, S and UPS. A synoptic key to the studied species is provided to contribute to a better
understanding of the genus and the taxonomy of the morphospecies. Original descriptions
are emended to include data on the anatomy of the apothecial excipulum and stipe layers,
apothecium and stipe reactivity to Melzer’s reagent, and ascospore ornamentation. Reasons
are given for maintaining H. subglabra, H. atra, H. griseoalba, and H. costifera as independent
taxa and for considering Helvella hyperborea a synonym of H. costifera. Previously imprecise
descriptive terms are clariﬁed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Helvella L. includes approximately 52 species (Kirk et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Its distribution is basically north temperate, with only one tropical species
recognized (Dissing 1979). Traditional taxonomy of the genus has been
based mainly on ascoma shape and color and the presence or absence of
projecting hyphae on the sterile surface (ectal excipulum) of the apothecium
(Dissing 1966b, Weber 1972, Abbott & Currah 1997). Characters such as
ascus development (aporhynchous or pleurorhynchous), ascospore shape and
size, paraphysis color, and the presence of pigment in the apothecium ectal
excipulum cells have proven to be of taxonomic value in some species (Weber
1972; Harmaja 1977b, 1979; Abbott & Currah 1997).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although Nannfeldt (1937) proposed using the term “apothecium”
speciﬁcally for Helvella to describe the entire ascoma, Weber (1972, 1975) and#Misc-exposition*]

[@36 ... Landeros, Iturriaga & Guzmán-Dávalos#Misc-exposition*]
[@Abbott & Currah (1988, 1997) used “apothecium” exclusively for the upper
ascoma — i.e., the hymenium and its immediate supporting tissues — without
the stipe. Eckblad (1968) commented that some authors carefully avoid the
term apothecium for pileate forms like Helvella, whereas Dissing (1966b) and
Calonge & Arroyo (1990) employed this term loosely, either for the complete
ascoma or just for the upper part. Here, we follow Weber’s (1972) concept,
applying the term apothecium only for the upper ascoma, except that where she
diﬀerentiated stipe tissues with “ectal excipulum” and “medullary excipulum,”
we use “outer layer” and “inner layer,” because in discomycetes “excipulum”
currently is interpreted as the “tissue or tissues containing the hymenium in an
apothecium” (Kirk et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In all Helvella species the medullary excipulum and stipe inner layer are
composed of “textura intricata” (interwoven hyphae) while the ectal excipulum
and stipe outer layer are a “textura angularis” (almost isodiametric cells without
intracellular spaces) (Korf 1952, Dissing 1966, Eckblad 1968, Weber 1972).#Misc-exposition*]
[@These cells are arranged in rows perpendicular to the surface. In glabrous
ascomata, the ectal excipulum external layer is a palisade of clavate hyphal
end-cells, ending more or less at the same level (Fig. 1) (Weber 1972). Hairy
ascomata have an ectal excipulum outer layer that Eckblad (1968) described as
“consisting of more or less swollen chains of cells often converging into distinct
clusters.” These clusters are called “hyphal fascicles” (Weber 1972) or “chains of
cells and/or fascicled hyphal chains” (Abbott & Currah 1997). Macroscopically,
they give the appearance of pubescence or hairs of diﬀerent lengths (Figs 2–3)
and are important in the taxonomy of the genus (Dissing 1966). Descriptive
terms used in the literature — “ﬁnely pubescent,” “furfuraceous,” “granulose,”
“hairy,” “pruinose,” “pubescent,” “roughened,” “velvety,” “villose” (Dissing 1966;
Weber 1972, 1975; Dennis 1981; Abbott & Currah 1997) — have generated
confusion through their diﬀerent meanings, incorrect application, and/or the
lack of consistent usage. Kaushal (1991) alone consistently uses only “pubescent”
to describe the hairs; furthermore he included the hyphal fascicle length for
each species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Only three papers have described the stipe tissue: Gómez & Herrera (1965)#Misc-exposition*]
[@and Weber (1972, 1975). Gómez & Herrera concluded that because stipe tissue
is continuous with apothecium tissue, it is not a useful character. Although
Weber (1972) described both tissues as similar in color and structure, she did
indicate color diﬀerences between tissues in some species descriptions.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pigment distribution, mainly in ectal excipulum cells (see Figs 19–21) and
paraphyses — i.e., intracellular (cytoplasmic), in the cell wall, or encrusting
(deposited pigment forming an irregular crust on the wall) — is controversial.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Eckblad (1968), Weber (1972), and Harmaja (1977b, 1979) considered
pigmentation to be diagnostic. Eckblad (1968) wrote it is a characteristic mostly#Misc-exposition*]

[@used on species level in Pezizales, but “[u]nfortunately too many descriptions
simply state whether the paraphyses are coloured or not, not where the pigments
are located.” With respect to Helvella, Eckblad (1968) noted, “[c]hemically
and genetically it is probably a very short step from pigmented paraphyses to#Misc-exposition*]

[@38 ... Landeros, Iturriaga & Guzmán-Dávalos#Misc-exposition*]
[@hyaline ones, e.g. from the greyish-black paraphyses of Helvella lacunosa to
the colourless paraphyses of H. crispa.” Weber (1972) recognized two patterns
of pigment distribution: 1) intracellular pigments, occurring in species with
buﬀ, tan or brown ascomata, and 2) pigments associated with hyphal walls,
characteristic of gray to black species. On the other hand, Dissing (1966b)
and Abbott & Currah (1997) considered pigmentation as highly variable and
of limited use in circumscribing Helvella species. Dissing (1966b) indicated it
is diﬃcult to assess, especially in species where hymenium color variation is
very large (as in H. lacunosa Afzel.) and hymenium color ranges from pale
gray to gray brown to black due to pigments in the paraphyses. Only Dissing
(1964, 1966b) went beyond just describing the colors of the structures; he also
evaluated the color before and after treatment with cotton blue. Unfortunately,
no further works analyze this issue.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Chemical reactions to Melzer’s reagent have not been considered as diagnostic
characters for structures other than ascospores or asci. Although excipulum
cells in other ascomycete genera (Perrotia, Hymenoscyphus, Epibryon) show a
hemiamyloid reaction, its taxonomic value is uncertain (Baral 1987).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Helvella ascospores have limited taxonomic value. In fact, their size is a
key feature only for H. pocillum and H. crassitunicata (Weber 1975; Harmaja
1976), while the fusoid to subfusoid shape (diﬀering from the typically ellipsoid
ascospores found elsewhere) is found only in H. macropus (Pers.) P. Karst.#Misc-exposition*]
[@(Abbott & Currah 1997) and H. terrestris (Velen.) Landvik (Landvik et al.
1999). Ascospore ornamentation is highly complex and a subject of controversy.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Dissing (1964) and Dissing & Nannfeldt (1966) regarded ornamented ascospores
in Helvella as immature, while Weber felt (1972) that they corresponded
to the mature condition. Eckblad (1968) described ascospores with “false
ornamentation,” and Schumacher (pers. com.) mentioned that during the ﬁnal
stage of ascospore development, some secondary wall remnants might adhere
to the ascospore surface, producing a highly inconsistent pattern; typically,
a number of ascospores do not get such adherences at all and consequently
remain smooth. On the other hand, Abbott & Currah (1997) gave to this
character a high value, because they considered verruculose ascospores unique
to the subgenus Macropodes (Dissing) S.P. Abbott.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Species concepts are similarly varied. Some authors with a narrow species
concept, such as Harmaja (1976, 1977a,b, 1979), segregated species based
on subtle diﬀerences. Others with a wider species concept (e.g., Abbott &
Currah 1997) use fewer diagnostic characters to separate Helvella species. The
purpose of our study was to review selected Helvella type specimens to delimit
morphospecies and to determine which characters could be used in taxonomic
and phylogenetic studies of the genus. We present ﬁve sets of types belonging
to species with problematic delimitations: 1) H. costifera vs. H. hyperborea#Misc-exposition*]

vs. H. dryadophila. We also add to the earlier descriptions of H. leucopus var.
populina, H. maculata, H. paraphysitorquata, and H. robusta. Finally, we suggest
a set of standard terms to clarify descriptions of Helvella species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sixteen type as well as some additional specimens from eight herbaria (DAOM, FH,
H, MA, MICH, O, S, UPS) were studied. Herbarium abbreviations follow Holmgren
et al. (1990). Free-hand sections from apothecium and stipe were made with a razor
blade directly from dry specimens. Sections and mycelium were placed ﬁrst in 70% ethyl
alcohol and subsequently in water to rehydrate the tissues. Specimens were examined
under a Zeiss Axioskop 2 plus microscope with a drawing tube. Microphotographs were
taken under a Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope using Axio Vision 4 software. Ascospore
measurements were made on mature free spores outside the asci, or on those attached
to the hymenial surface, stipe, or basal mycelia. Mounts from apothecium, stipe, and
mycelium were also made in Melzer’s reagent (without pre-treatment in KOH) and
cotton blue. We follow in part the terminology used by Baral (1987) to describe the
hemiamyloid reaction in Melzer’s reagent (‘Melzer’s’): “rr+” for hemiamyloid (“solely
red”) reaction and “rr–” for negative reaction. All measurements and features recorded
are from type specimens. Where additional non-type specimens were studied for some
species, observations that diﬀer from those of the type are indicated under “Remarks”
but not included in the technical description.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Terms used to refer to the surface of the apothecial ectal excipulum and stipe outer
layer are: glabrous (Fig. 1), sub-pubescent (for fascicled hyphal chains < 50 μm long;
Fig. 2), and pubescent (for fascicled hyphal chains > 50 μm long; Fig. 3). As the hairs’
length can vary in the last case, their measurements are given in the descriptions. See
also “Results & discussion”.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results & discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@We studied sixteen type specimens and present only new information or
data that diﬀers from the protologue or previous publications. In addition
to the characters established by previous authors (Dissing 1966b; Calonge &
Arroyo 1990; Abbott & Currah 1997), we found that pigmentation of apothecial
cells, stipe tissue anatomy, and the reddish (hemiamyloid) reaction in Melzer’s
reagent (Figs 10–11) are important characters that contribute to species
recognition in Helvella. Because we found no variation in the basal mycelium
of the stipe, which is universally composed of smooth-walled, hyaline, rr–,
interwoven hyphae, we do not include it in the species descriptions. Nor do
we make further mention of the fact that ascospores of all species have both
cyanophilic cytoplasm and ornamentation (when present).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Regarding the value of pigmentation in the structures, we think it is important
to study it from two perspectives: a) location and b) intensity. Concerning#Misc-exposition*]

[@40 ... Landeros, Iturriaga & Guzmán-Dávalos#Misc-exposition*]
[@location, pigment may occur in the cytoplasm, in the wall, or encrusted on
the wall (Figs 19–21). We observed that while the ﬁrst two are constant within
species, encrusted pigments are variable. For example, in H. costifera there are
specimens with encrusted paraphyses and others without such incrustations.#Misc-exposition*]
[@On the matter of pigment intensity, we return to cotton blue used ﬁrst by
Dissing (1964) to note that there are species where the cytoplasmic pigment
color is so intense that it is still visible even after adding cotton blue, while
others have lighter pigment no longer visible when adding the colorant (Figs
12–17). We realized that this characteristic is constant among specimens of the
same species. This also happens with the pigment in the cell wall.#Misc-exposition*]
[@As indicated in the introduction, only Weber (1972, 1975) described the
stipe tissue. We consider this character taxonomically valuable for the following
reasons: 1) the hyphal fascicle lengths among specimens of the same species
are more constant than in the apothecial sterile surface (see H. hyperborea
remarks); 2) the pigments in the ectal excipulum and stipe outer layer can
diﬀer in water and cotton blue (see H. ulvinenii remarks; Fig. 22); and 3) the
hemiamyloid reaction can occur in stipe tissue but not in the excipulum (e.g.
H. leucopus var. populina).#Misc-exposition*]
[@As Baral (1987) noted, we know little about hemiamyloid reaction, and there
indeed are few records of this reaction in tissues other than the hymenium. We
report this reaction in diﬀerent apothecial and stipe tissues for H. leucopus var.
populina, H. robusta, and H. subglabra; we have also observed this reaction in
specimens of H. albella Quél., H. connivens Dissing & M. Lange (holotype),
H. elastica Bull., and H. stevensii Peck (unpublished data).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Concerning ascospore ornamentation, we make the following points. 1)
Ornamented ascospores are not restricted to H. subgen. Macropodes (here
represented only by H. macropus, Fig. 18a) as Abbott & Currah (1997)#Misc-exposition*]
[@proposed. We have also observed ornamented ascospores (generally only in
mature ascospores outside the asci) in the type specimens of H. leucopus var.
populina (Fig. 18b), H. paraphysitorquata (Fig. 18c), H. solitaria, H. subglabra,
and H. ulvinenii. 2) We agree with Weber (1972) that it is the mature Helvella
ascospores that are verrucose, contrary to the assumption of Dissing (1964)#Misc-exposition*]
[@and Dissing & Nannfeldt (1966) that ornamented ascospores are the immature
ones. 3) When citing ascospore sizes, it is important to indicate what kind of
spores (smooth vs. ornamented) were measured, because in some species they
have diﬀerent size range (Fig. 9) (see remarks under H. queletii).#Misc-exposition*]
[@As noted previously, many diﬀerent terms have been used to describe the
apothecial and stipe outer layer surfaces, giving the impression that there were
diﬀerent types of hairs. However, in all cases these hairs are developmentally
the same: they consist of hyphal clusters that diﬀer only in length. The tiny hairs
have been especially problematic; Weber (1972) and Abbott & Currah (1997)#Misc-exposition*]

[@used indistinct terms such as “ﬁnely pubescent,” “furfuraceous,” “granulose,”
or “granulose-roughened” — all with very diﬀerent meaning. Here we propose
to the term “subpubescent” to indicate that they have the same microscopic
structure (i.e. are hyphal fascicles) of the hairs found on a “pubescent” surface
but are simply shorter (Fig. 2). Likewise, longer hairs have been described
as “pubescent” or “villose,” without considering that the terms may refer to
diﬀerent types of hairs. We use “pubescent” (Fig. 3) to emphasize that Helvella
has only one hair type that varies only in length. This agrees with Kaushal’s
(1991) terminology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Helvella crassitunicata and H. leucomelaena (Pers.) Nannf. are the
only two taxa with aporhynchous asci (Fig. 5) (Abbott & Currah 1997). Helvella
leucomelaena is diﬀerentiated by mature paraphyses that are never thickwalled, slightly smaller (20–23(–25) × 10.5–14 μm) ascospores, and ascomata
that fruit in spring or early summer. [However, although Weber (1972) cited
H. crassitunicata as fruiting in the fall, Abbott & Currah (1997) noted it
might fruit from May to October.] Also in H. leucomelaena the stipe is poorly
developed or absent and the color of the paraphyses is lost in cotton blue.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Neither Weber (1972) nor we observed the following features cited for
H. crassitunicata by Abbott & Currah (1997): 1) ectal excipulum “pubescent

350–400 × 17–20 µm. It is uncertain whether the diﬀerences in wall thickness of
the paraphyses should be interpreted as dimorphic (Abbott & Currah 1997) or
developmental (young = thin-walled and mature = thick-walled; Weber 1975).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Since a hymenium develops ﬁrst as a palisade of paraphyses within which the
asci develop, it would be diﬃcult to have mature asci and immature paraphyses

[@Remarks — We agree with Abbott & Currah (1997) that H. dryadophila is
a synonym of H. verruculosa, because Harmaja (1977b, 1979) used variable
characters to distinguish them. 1) Both ascomata appear the same: Harmaja’s
own illustration (1977b: 51) (Fig. 5) shows both species with a cup-shaped
apothecium and a ribbed stipe with ribs that never reach the apothecial
sterile surface. 2) For the excipulum, Harmaja cited, “the outermost layer
has somewhat larger cells with slightly thicker wall as H. arctoalpina,” but
gave no measurements, and we did not see such diﬀerences. 3) The paler and
homogeneous contents of paraphyses in H. dryadophila did not appear paler to
us; in fact, in cotton blue, the brown pigments are visible in the paraphyses of
both species. The homogeneous content is variable and the pigment tends to be
less homogeneous in immature ascomata. 4) As the presence of a fairly distinct
layer of textura angularis in the excipulum is a generic character for Helvella, its
occurrence should not be used to distinguish between species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Abbott & Currah (1997) mentioned that H. arctoalpina Harmaja (Harmaja
1977) should also be considered a synonym of H. verruculosa, but as the type

the holotype.#Misc-exposition*]

hyphal fascicles in the stipe while H. griseoalba does not (glabrous) or has
shorter (subpubescent) hyphal fascicles; 2) H. costifera can have light brown

[@Remarks — Helvella hyperborea was proposed as a new species by Harmaja
(1978) and accepted as distinct by Abbott & Currah (1997). After comparing
its type with H. costifera, including eleven additional specimens from Herbaria
O and UPS (labeled either H. costifera or H. hyperborea), we conclude these
two species are the same. Harmaja (1979, Table 1) listed 12 characters for
diﬀerentiating H. hyperborea from H. costifera but explained that only a
combination of all features should be used for its identiﬁcation. In fact, we
think that his table is an excellent presentation of variability in H. costifera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We provide below our evaluation of what we consider the ﬁve most important
features used by Harmaja (1979) to separate these species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@1) A brown-grey hymenium color that is paler in H. costifera — we have observed
that in fresh material, the color intensity of the hymenium may depend on
whether the specimen is growing in a forest clearing or in a shaded area.#Description*]
[@2) Ribs extending onto the sterile surface, especially in dried specimens —
Although Harmaja (1979; Figs. 2–3) illustrated this feature, we found that the
H. costifera isolectotype also has ribs on the sterile surface as, for that matter,
does H. acetabulum.#Description*]
[@3) Sterile surface of the apothecium: “with ﬁne but almost always ± distinct
hyaline to pale brown pubescence or villosity” (H. costifera) versus “more or
less delicate brown (mostly dark) pubescence usually appearing glabrous to bare
eye” (H. hyperborea) — Under the microscope, the hairs of all studied specimens
have the same color. However, we measured 100–230 μm long hyphal fascicles in
the H. costifera type vs. 50–160 μm long fascicles in H. hyperborea. The hairs as
measured in the additional specimens range from 50–240 μm long, depending
on the maturity of the ascoma. In the stipe hair lengths are similar for both types
— 50–120 μm long in H. costifera, 40–100 μm long in H. hyperborea — and
remains relatively constant (40–120 μm) in the additional specimens.#Description*]
[@4) Pigmentation of the paraphyses: “medium (rarely pale) brown wall
encrustation” and more or less brown contents (H. hyperborea) versus hyaline,
inconspicuous or pale brown encrustation and pale brown to practically hyaline
contents (H. costifera) — We observed the same color in the paraphyses for both
species, and in cotton blue the cytoplasmic pigment is inconspicuous; the cell
wall pigment is variable among specimens in both species.#Description*]
[@5) Distribution, “middle boreal to lower oroarctic (low alpine), optimal area
apparently northern boreal zone” (H. hyperborea) versus “temperate to middle
(oro)boreal with preference for southern and low-lying areas” (H. costifera)
— Sequences of the 28s large subunit ribosomal DNA from three specimens
identiﬁed as H. costifera (unpublished) from Scandinavia (two from northern
boreal specimens and one from the middle boreal region) show only one or two
base diﬀerences. Notably, both species were described from the Scandinavian
peninsula.#Misc-exposition*]

Moravec (1980) previously cited larger specimens of H. leucopus var. leucopus

Abbott & Currah 1997). Furthermore, the brownish pigment of the stipe
outer layer is evident in cotton blue in H. maculata but not in H. crispa. For
Weber (1975) ascospore size could help diﬀerentiate the two species, but the
size range we observed for H. maculata overlaps with that seen in H. crispa

those recorded by Calonge & Arroyo (1990; 7–10(–15) μm), possibly due
to their rehydration in 2% KOH or 10% NH3. Helvella paraphysitorquata

[@Remarks — Helvella pocillum is characterized by its very small ascoma;
only H. rivularis Dissing & Sivertsen is as small, but with an even stipe. For
Harmaja (1976) H. pocillum could be separated from H. crassitunicata by its
larger ascospores, the width of the paraphyses (we found no diﬀerences in
either of these characters), and the absence of thick-walled paraphyses. Besides,
H. crassitunicata has aporhynchous asci (Fig. 5) and the sterile surfaces of
apothecium and stipe are glabrous to subpubescent. Another similar species is
H. leucomelaena, also with aporhynchous asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Bresadola (1882), who described H. queletii as having a cupshaped apothecium, sulcate-lacunose stipe (“costate” according to Weber 1972),
and ascospores measuring 17–20 × 12 μm, noted its proximity to H. lacunosa
but without mentioning the diﬀerences with H. solitaria. Dissing (1966b)
diﬀerentiated H. queletii from H. solitaria by the following: 1) ascospore size —
17–19.1–21 × 11–12.3–13.5 μm (H. queletii) vs. 19–21.7–24 × 12–13.1–15 μm
(H. solitaria); 2) ascoma size — 20–80 mm broad apothecium, 20–60 mm
high stipe (H. queletii) vs. 10–40 mm broad apothecium, 10–25 mm high
stipe (H. solitaria); 3) hymenium color (pale brownish to dark greyish-brown
(H. queletii) vs. greyish to greyish-brown (H. solitaria); 4) stipe rib number
— 4–7 in H. queletii vs. 2–5 in H. solitaria; 5) fruiting time — April–October in
H. queletii vs. February–June in H. solitaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@56 ... Landeros, Iturriaga & Guzmán-Dávalos#Misc-exposition*]
[@Harmaja (1977a) suggested that H. queletii be recognized as a synonym of
H. solitaria based on the variability of ascoma size, color, pubescence, and stipe
rib number. Abbott & Currah (1997) also considered them synonymous (but
see below under H. solitaria). The following list summarizes our observations
of both holotypes and other original descriptions.#Misc-exposition*]
[@1) The H. solitaria holotype has smooth ascospores and a spore range (18–20 ×
9.5–12 μm) matching that of the H. queletii holotype and as reported by Dissing
(1966b). We also found smaller (15–17.5 × 9.5–11.5 μm) verrucose ascospores
more closely matching measurements given by Karsten (1871, 14–16 × 10 μm)
but never matching that cited by Dissing (1966b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@2) Ascoma size, highly variable in Helvella, is not a good taxonomic criterion for
a widespread species,#Misc-exposition*]
[@3) Ascoma color is highly variable in H. queletii with tones very similar to
H. solitaria, as noted in Dissing (1966a) and Dissing & Nannfeldt (1966),
4) Among materials cited as H. queletii by Dissing (1966b) is a specimen
collected in March (Velenovsky s.n., Mar 1923, PRC), while among his
H. solitaria materials are specimens collected in July (Eftesøl s.n., 8 Jul 1956, O;
Berg s.n., 15 Jul 1957, O), August (Bresadola s.n., Aug 1893, S; Hakelier s.n., 28

[@Remarks — Abbott & Currah (1988, 1997) described H. robusta with
apothecium that is irregularly cupulate or centrally depressed with reﬂexed
margins; in addition to this type, we observed an irregularly bi-lobed
apothecium covering the stipe, with the apothecial edges curved towards the
stipe, thus fully exposing the hymenium. The peculiar shape of the ascoma
makes H. robusta easy to recognize, although Abbott & Currah (1988) noted
that it could be confused with some species of section Acetabulum, although
members of that section have a well-deﬁned cup-shaped apothecium in all stages
of development. In addition to its peculiar apothecial shape, H. robusta has a
strong reddish reaction in the apothecial medullary excipulum and stipe inner
layer and moderately reddish reaction in the stipe outer layer in Melzer’s.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Helvella solitaria can be confused with H. pocillum, H. ulvinenii,
and H. verruculosa because of its cup-shaped apothecium, costate stipe with
ribs extending only to the base or a short distance onto the apothecium, and
pleurorhynchous asci. Helvella pocillum has larger ascospores (22–30 × 13–17
μm). Helvella ulvinenii has brown, sepia to black apothecial sterile surface (never
with grayish tones), brown pigment of the apothecial hyphal fascicles visible in
cotton blue and hyaline stipe hyphal fascicles. Helvella verruculosa diﬀers in
the visibility of the brown cytoplasmic pigments in the ectal excipulum and
apothecial hyphal fascicles in cotton blue, and its arctic and alpine distribution
contrasts with the boreal and temperate distribution for H. solitaria (Abbott &
Currah 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

(1977a,b) that mature and immature ascospore sizes diﬀer in some species, but
in view of the greater size variation in H. solitaria, we consider it important to
list the sizes of both immature and mature ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although Dissing (1966b) recognized H. solitaria and H. queletii as diﬀerent
species, we agree with Harmaja (1977a) that they are synonyms, with the name
H. solitaria having priority (see discussion under H. queletii).#Misc-exposition*]
[@According to Abbott & Currah (1997), H. solitaria sensu Dissing (1966b)
corresponds to H. leucomelaena. We do not agree with this because of the
following: 1) H. leucomelaena has aporhynchous asci; Dissing (1966b) did not
mention the ascus base, and 2) the specimens studied by Dissing do not seem
to correspond to a single species. Harmaja (1977a) designated one Dissing
H. solitaria specimen as holotype of H. confusa Harmaja (also considered a
synonym under H. leucomelaena by Abbott & Currah, 1997), while other Dissing
specimens correspond to diﬀerent species, among them H. leucomelaena and
H. solitaria (Harmaja 1979). As Dissing’s concept of H. solitaria was very broad,
it cannot be attributed to a particular taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

apothecia and costate stipes with ribs that do not reach the sterile apothecial

[@that H. ulvinenii is distinguished from H. solitaria by 1) a darker sterile surface

margin” of the apothecium (sometimes with distinct white hairs), the stipe as
having few chambers, and with stipe ribs extending onto basal half of apothecial
sterile surface. We did not observe the marginal hairs, perhaps because the
hairs have been lost due to age or handling. Furthermore, we observed neither
stipe chambers nor ribs on the sterile surface of the apothecium. In fact,
H. verruculosa is more easily confused with H. solitaria and H. ulvinenii, which
do not have ribs on the sterile surface (see diﬀerences under the remarks of
these species) than with H. acetabulum, H. costifera, and H. griseoalba.#Misc-exposition*]
