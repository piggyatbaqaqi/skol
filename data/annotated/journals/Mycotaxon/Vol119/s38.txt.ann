[@Abstract — Skeletocutis bambusicola sp. nov. is described and illustrated from the
tropical region of Yunnan, southern China. The species is characterized by the annual,
resupinate cream-colored basidiocarps, small pores, a dimitic hyphal system, small ellipsoid
basidiospores, and habit on dead bamboo. The combination of characters distinguishes
S. bambusicola from other known species of Skeletocutis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Encrustation of hyphae at the dissepiment edges of polypores is a special and
steady morphological character in taxonomy. Species with encrusted hyphae
have been referred to three genera: Tyromyces P. Karst., Piloporia Niemelä,
and Skeletocutis Kotl. & Pouzar (Niemelä 1998). Niemelä (1998) diﬀerentiated
Skeletocutis from the other two genera by its strong tendency to form eﬀused
basidiocarps with a homogeneous to duplex context and hyaline hyphae.
Niemelä (1998) reviewed the collections of resupinate Skeletocutis species
from East Finland and North Sweden, while Dai (1998) provided a key to all
accepted Skeletocutis species from China. More recently, Núñez & Ryvarden
(2001) delimit Skeletocutis based on its dimitic system and encrustation of the
hyphae at dissepiment edges.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetically, Skeletocutis is closely related to Tyromyces (Kim et al. 2001)
and clusters within the Polyporales (Miettinen & Larsson 2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Two species, Skeletocutis lenis (P. Karst.) Niemelä and S. vulgaris (Fr.)
Niemelä & Y.C. Dai, were transferred to a new genus, Sidera Miettinen & K.H.
Larss. (Hymenochaetales) based on ITS (internal transcribed spacer) and LSU
(large subunit) nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) sequence analyses (Miettinen
& Larsson 2011). Although representing diﬀerent orders, Skeletocutis and#Misc-exposition*]

[@346 ... Zhou & Qin#Page-header*]
[@Sidera share many morphological characters, including whitish resupinate
basidiocarps (in many species) with small pores, allantoid basidiospores,
and narrow skeletal hyphae (Miettinen & Larsson 2011). The main diﬀerence
between the two genera is that Skeletocutis usually has hyphae encrusted by ﬁne
crystals on the tube mouths, whereas in Sidera the dissepiment edge hyphae are
smooth or covered with a few faceted crystal clusters (Niemelä 1998, Miettinen
& Larsson 2011). Therefore species with faceted, rather than ﬁne, crystals at the
dissepiment edges should be excluded from Skeletocutis. Moreover, molecular
data do not support the concept of Skeletocutis as restricted to dimitic hyphal
structure but one that includes species with a monomitic hyphal system
(Miettinen & Larsson 2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Extensive studies on Chinese wood-decaying fungi have recorded 704
polypores and 505 corticioid or hydnoid fungi for China (Dai 2011, 2012a),
among which many new taxa have been described from tropical China (Cui
& Dai 2008, Cui et al. 2009, 2010, Yuan & Dai 2009, Dai & Cui 2011, Dai & Li
2010, Dai 2012b, Dai et al. 2009, 2010, 2011, Zhou & Jia 2010). Nonetheless,
the diversity and richness of tropical wood-decaying fungi are still not well
known. During a study on polypores from tropical Yunnan, an unknown
species with ﬁnely encrusted hyphae growing on dead bamboo was identiﬁed.
It is described and illustrated here as Skeletocutis bambusicola following the
generic concepts of Niemelä (1998) and Núñez & Ryvarden (2001) according
to its latest delimitation (Miettinen & Larsson 2011). This represents the 22nd
Skeletocutis species recorded in China (Dai 2012a).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The studied specimens were deposited at the herbarium of the Institute of Applied
Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IFP, Shenyang, China). The microscopic
procedure follows Dai (2010). Sections were studied at magniﬁcations up to ×1000
using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with phase contrast illumination. The spore size
variation excludes 5% of measurements (given in parentheses) from each end of the
range. Abbreviations used are: IKI = Melzer’s reagent, IKI– = negative in Melzer’s, KOH
= 5% potassium hydroxide, CB = Cotton Blue, CB– = acyanophilous, L = mean spore
length (average of all spores), W = mean spore width (average of all spores), Q = variation
in L/W ratios among all specimens studied, and n = number of spores measured from
given number of specimens. Drawings were made with the aid of a drawing tube. Special
color terms follow Petersen (1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@borealis and S. percandida are distinguished from the new species by their
cylindrical basidiospores (Niemelä 1998). The other three similar species
also have ellipsoid basidiospores, S. alutacea is distinguished by its longer
basidiospores (L = 2.9–3.8 µm, Niemelä 1998) and rhizomorphic basidiocarps
while S. krawtzewii and S. perennis diﬀer in larger basidiospores (3.4–4.1 ×
1.7–2 in S. krawtzewii; 2.9–3.6 × 1.8–2.1 in S. perennis) and larger pores (5–6
per mm; Niemelä 1998). In addition, S. krawtzewii has monomitic hyphae
at dissepiment edge and thin-walled skeletal hyphae (Niemelä 1998) and
S. perennis has perennial basidiocarps with subparallel hyphae in the subiculum
(Niemelä 1998). The main morphological diﬀerences among the six species are
compared in Table 1.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Niemelä (1998) proposed that, “Ecological characteristics are important
when identifying the species of Skeletocutis.” Skeletocutis bambusicola was
found on dead bamboo, which might be the most important evidence that
separates it from other species of Skeletocutis.#Misc-exposition*]
