[@Abstract — Psilocybe deconicoides, P. cubensis, P. magnispora, P. samuiensis, and
P. thailandensis (previously known from Thailand) are revisited, and P. thaiaerugineomaculans,
P. thaicordispora, P. thaiduplicatocystidiata, and P. thaizapoteca are described as new species.
These new species are bluing and belong to sections Cordisporae, Stuntzae, and Zapotecorum.
Following the recent conservation of Psilocybe as the generic name for bluing species,
P. deconicoides, which does not blue upon bruising, is transferred to Deconica, while the bluing
taxa P. cubensis (sect. Cubensae), P. magnispora and P. thailandensis (sect. Neocaledonicae),
and P. samuiensis (sect. Mexicanae) remain in Psilocybe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hallucinogenic fungal species in Thailand, as in most tropical countries,
are poorly known, which is in direct contrast with the large fungal diversity
that occurs throughout the tropics. Moreover, with considerable destruction
of tropical habitats for use as agricultural or cattle farms, many species will
likely disappear before being documented. We have been surveying several
mushroom genera in northern Thailand (e.g. Le et al. 2007, Sanmee et al. 2008,
Wannathes et al. 2009, Zhao et al. 2010, Karunarathna et al. 2011); but studies
of Psilocybe are rare. Despite the recreational use of hallucinogenic mushrooms
in the country (see Allen & Merlin 1992), we have found only a few references#Misc-exposition*]

[@66 ... Guzmán & al.#Page-header*]
[@in papers by Heim (1958, 1962), Guzmán et al. (1993), Chamratpan (2003),
Klinhom et al. (2003), and Horak et al. (2009). Fortunately, Thailand now has
a mycological research station, Mushroom Research Centre, where local and
visiting mycologists can explore, gather and study fungi. We report Psilocybe
spp. collected in 2010 in the area surrounding the Research Centre. We
describe four species as new and discuss ﬁve species previously reported from
Thailand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@For microscopic study, thin hand sections of the basidiome, mainly in the pileus,
including context and lamellae, were rehydrated with 96% alcohol and then mounted in
5% KOH and 1% Congo Red solutions (the latter added to tissues previously mounted
in KOH). Basidiospore dimensions indicate length and width (face view) and thickness
(side view). At least 25 measurements were taken for each microscopic feature. All
specimens are deposited at Mae Fah Luang University herbarium (MFLU), Chiang
Rai, Thailand, with duplicates in the Fungus Collection at XAL Herbarium, at Xalapa,
Mexico.#Misc-exposition*]

≡ Stropharia cubensis Earle, Estudios Agronómicos, Cuba 1: 240, 1906#Nomenclature*]

[@This is an important hallucinogenic mushroom with a pantropical
distribution, although the records from Africa (Cullinan et al. 1945, Vedcourt
& Trump 1969) are still under study to determine whether they represent
P. aquamarina (Pegler) Guzmán (≡ Stropharia aquamarina Pegler), as
discussed by Heim (1958, 1962), Pegler (1977), and Guzmán (1995). The Thai
material (identiﬁed as Stropharia cubensis) studied by Heim, based on two
collections (one by Apaiwongse, the second by Champagne) from the Bangkok
region in 1957, agree well with the Mexican specimens studied by Heim.
Recently Chamratpan (2003) and Klinhom et al. (2003) reported P. cubensis
from Thailand as a “magic” and/or “soporiﬁc” mushroom. This coprophilous
fungus, common on cattle and horse dung in meadows, probably grows also in
Thailand on wild mammal dung. The African mentioned above was reported by
Vedcourt & Trump (1969) on monkey dung, and Guzmán & Ramírez-Guillén
(2010) reported the closely related P. subcubensis Guzmán on rhinoceros dung
in Nepal. Nonetheless, Guzmán did not ﬁnd P. cubensis nor P. subcubensis
in meadows explored in Thailand in 2010, where he found only Copelandia
cyanescens (Berk. & Broome) Singer and Panaeolus spp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion. Psilocybe thaiduplicatocystidiata with its small, subrhomboid,
thick-walled spores is a special member of the sect. Cordisporae as it has two
types of both pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia, one as pseudocystidia, a feature
not previously observed on any species of sect. Cordisporae (Guzmán 1983,
1995). This species may also possess a pseudorhiza, but this was lost during
picking. The basidiome is similar to P. caerulescens Murrill, but that species lacks
pleurocystidia, the cheilocystidia are not polymorphous and its basidiospores
are (6–)6.5–8(–8.5) µm long. P. thaiduplicatocystidiata is also similar to
P. wrightii Guzmán, but the latter has simple pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia,
and also smaller spores. These two similar species are only known from the
neotropics.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Final considerations#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is interesting that four new species were found during such a short
excursion time (ﬁve days) in Thailand, while none of the ﬁve species
previously reported for the country were found. We suggest this demonstrates
the complexity of mushroom fructiﬁcation and at same time the richness
of the mycota in the tropics. We conﬁrmed that species of Psilocybe s.s.
sects. Cordisporae, Mexicanae, Stuntzae, and Zapotecorum are tropical or
subtropical. We also observed that bluing species have a greatly varied habitat,
for example, litter, muddy soil, rotten wood or dung. Although the odor and
taste of basidiomata are generally farinaceous for all bluing Psilocybe species,
for Thai species odor and taste are either not distinctive or acidulous to only
very slightly farinaceous, with the taste of dried material in all four new
species (as well of fresh basidiomata in P. thaizapoteca) becoming strongly
pungent after some minutes.#Misc-exposition*]
