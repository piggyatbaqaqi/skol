Mycotaxon is pleased to announce the addition of ﬁve new species distribution lists to
our “web-list” page at www.mycotaxon.com//resources/weblists.html, where a total of 89
checklist PDFs are now available for free download. The content and design of each list
is the sole responsibility of its authors and their three (or more) expert reviewers. Those
meeting Mycotaxon’s scientiﬁc and nomenclatural criteria are accepted for posting. The

[@Abstract ⎯ A checklist of species belonging to families Amanitaceae, Pluteaceae,
and Hygrophoraceae was made for Argentina. The list includes all species published
till year 2011. Eleven genera and 150 species were recorded. The family Pluteaceae is
the most cited for the country with 93 species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ovicidal, nematophagous, coprophilous, keratinophilic, dermatophytic, and
thermoresistant fungi are also reported. The review contains microfungal species
from peat and peat substrates, litter, vermicompost, enchytraeid and earthworm
intestine and casts, and cattle environs, as well as records from soils aﬀected by
windthrow, ﬁre, heavy metals and human activity. In addition, microfungi which are
isolated from various substrates from underground environments, with the exception
of airborne fungi, are included. A total of 1,332 microfungal records are reported in
this list (54 of them belonging to yeasts or yeast-like microfungi and 1,278 belonging
to ﬁlamentous fungi), representing 385 genera and 1,283 species of microscopic
fungi. One microfungal taxon belongs to Microsporidiomycota, seven taxa belong to
Chromista, 164 to Mucoromycotina, 1,133 to Ascomycota, and 28 to Basidiomycota.
Forty-nine records were reported as undetermined fungi or sterile mycelia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Masoomeh Ghobad-Nejhad & Nils Hallenberg. Checklist of Iranian non-gilled/
non-gasteroid hymenomycetes (Agaricomycotina). 41 p.
Abstract ⎯ This list includes 395 species of Iranian non-gilled/non-gasteroid
hymenomycetes. Corticioid, poroid (polypores), hydnoid, clavarioid, cantharelloid,
thelephoroid, and cyphelloid fungi are covered, together with heterobasidiomycetes.
Almost all the species are supported by at least one herbarium specimen. The list
has been compiled mainly from material collected by the authors, veriﬁed reports
and literature. Nineteen species are reported for the ﬁrst time from the country,
and 118 species are added to the most recent account of aphyllophoroid fungi of
North Iran by Hallenberg (1981, Mycotaxon 12: 473–502). The occurrence in Iran
of six species is regarded as doubtful, while 12 species are excluded. The number
of species known for each province in Iran is listed, with Golestan shown to be the
most species-rich province. The total number of species recognized for major Iranian
phytogeographical territories is also noted and Funalia trogii, Inonotus hispidus, and
Schizophyllum commune are shown to be the most widespread species. A permanent
repository for continuous updates has been made available via the Myco-Lich website,
and future new records for the country will be published online. Users can access
the latest changes to the checklist via subscription to a feed (RSS). The link to the
