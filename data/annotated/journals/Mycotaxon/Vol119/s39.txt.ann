[@Abstract—Comparison of nrITS sequences of the type specimens of Paxillus ammoniavirescens and P. validus show them to be identical. The name Paxillus ammoniavirescens was
published in ‘Spring 1999’ [northern hemisphere] and that of Paxillus validus in August 1999,
making P. ammoniavirescens the correct name for this species. A variant without pigments
ﬁts into P. involutus, suggesting that P. albidulus might be an albino variant of any species
in the P. involutus complex. Paxillus ammoniavirescens is widespread in Europe and has
been introduced in the southern hemisphere; P. obscurosporus is known from China and
Europe; and the two taxa in the P. involutus clade are reported from Europe and from North
America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Paxillus Fr. is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere,
forms ectomycorrhiza with a range of host trees, is extensively used in
ectomycorrhizal research (e.g. Ek 1997, Leake et al. 2001, Prendergast-Miller
et al. 2011, Wilkinson et al. 2010), and is a nightmare for species recognition.
There are two main species clusters — P. rubicundulus P.D. Orton and allies,
associating with Alnus species, and the P. involutus complex, associating with a
range of host trees (Pinaceae, Fagaceae, Salicaceae, Corylaceae, Tiliaceae, etc.).
Hedh et al. (2008), who recently addressed species concepts of the European
taxa in the P. involutus complex, recognized four species based on ﬁve gene
genealogies and nrITS sequence analyses. Three of the four phylogenetic
species correspond with the intercompatibility groups identiﬁed by Fries
(1985). Hedh et al. (2008) recognized Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr., P. validus,
P. obscurosporus C. Hahn, and a fourth species, sister to P. involutus, which they
refrained from naming.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three Paxillus species revisited ... 353#Page-header*]

[@Two other species have been described from Europe, P. albidulus Šutara
(Šutara 1992), a predominantly white species, and P. ammoniavirescens (Dessì
& Contu 1999), characterized by a strong green reaction of the pileus surface
with ammonia. As these species were not included in the study by Hedh et
al. (2008), their identity and relationship to the phylogenetic species remained
unresolved.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Here, we investigate the identity of P. ammoniavirescens and the phylogenetic
placement of taxa without pigments using nrITS sequence data and phylogenetic
methods.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material—Type material of P. ammoniavirescens, additional collections of P. ammoniavirescens from the type locality, various Paxillus collections from the UK and France,
and Paxillus collections growing with introduced Betula in western North America were
used for analyses (Table I).#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA extraction to sequencing—DNA was extracted from dried material using a
Qiagen DNeasy® Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). PCR was done
under standard conditions using the following primers: ITS-1F and ITS-4 for nrITS1,
5.8S and nrITS2 (Gardes & Bruns 1993). PCR reactions were performed with an MJ
PTC-100™ thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) or an Eppendorf
Mastercycler® gradient (Eppendorf, North America, Inc.,Westbury, NY, USA). PCR
products were cleaned using 0.5 µl of ExoSAP IT (USB Corp, Cleveland, OH, USA)
per reaction and cycled at 37°C for 45 min, followed by 80°C for 15 min. Sequencing
was performed using Big Dye chemistry, with the same primers as for PCR, and an ABI
PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (both from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequences were edited and contigs assembled using Sequencher 4.2.2 (Gene Codes
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). All newly produced sequences were deposited in
GenBank (see table I).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic methods—nrITS sequences of the European species in the P. involutus
species complex available in GenBank and the UNITE database, from vouchered
specimens and from environmental samples, were downloaded and added to the
database. The sequences were aligned with the program MAFFT version 6 (Katoh et
al. 2002; Katoh & Toh 2008), using default settings. The database was analyzed by a
maximum likelihood (ML) method using RAxML version 7.2.3 (Stamatakis et al. 2008).
Paxillus rubicundulus was chosen as outgroup.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

[@The four phylogenetic European species recognized by Hedh et al. (2008)
are also recovered in our nrITS sequence analyses (fig. 1), with high bootstrap
support for P. validus/P. ammoniavirescens (95%), P. involutus I (100%), and
P. involutus II (100%). The type collection of P. ammoniavirescens and the type
collection of P. validus have identical ITS sequences. Collections from England#Misc-exposition*]

[@354 ... Vellinga & al.#Page-header*]
[@and France with sequences newly generated for this study also belong to
P. ammoniavirescens/P. validus, plus one collection from New Zealand.
Sister to the P. ammoniavirescens/P. validus clade is P. obscurosporus, with
collections from all over Europe, and one from China. The other two taxa
represent P. involutus clade I, with specimens in Europe and North America
(Wisconsin, Tennessee, British Columbia, Alaska), and P. involutus clade II,
with representatives in Europe and in western North America where they grow
with introduced Betula. Paxillus involutus I includes a specimen from England
that lacks pigments.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hedh et al. (2008) used ﬁve genes, actA, gpiA, hydA, rabA, and ss-tubA,
for phylogenetic species recognition in the P. involutus group, but concluded
that nrITS on its own discriminated the four phylogenetic species recovered
from the multi-gene analyses. Hence, for this study, nrITS was used to assign
specimens to species. However, nrITS sequences alone are not suﬃcient to
diﬀerentiate the North American species P. vernalis Watling from P. validus
(Hedh et al. 2008), nor western North American collections that are very close
to P. obscurosporus and grow with native and introduced tree species in native
and anthropogenic habitats (data not shown).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The nrITS sequences of the type collections of P. ammoniavirescens
(Genbank JN661718) and P. validus (Genbank EU084666) are identical. The
two original descriptions emphasize diﬀerent characters, e.g. Hahn & Agerer
(1999) described the relatively big crystals on the rhizomorphs of P. validus,
whereas Dessì & Contu (1999) did not comment on this character. The reactions
of the various parts of the basidiocarps with a set of chemicals is given in both
articles, with slight diﬀerences. Dessì & Contu (1999) emphasized the green
reaction of the pileipellis in ammonia, whereas Hahn & Agerer described this
reaction as ‘schwarz überhaucht;’ this diﬀerence in reaction might be caused
by diﬀerences in age of the basidiocarp or by diﬀerent concentrations of
the reagent, but neither set of authors provided that information. For KOH
diﬀerent concentrations were used: 15% by Hahn & Agerer (1999), 5% by Dessì
& Contu (1999). In both descriptions the pileus is introduced as ribbed, the two
species are similar in general stature, and the spore sizes and spore print colour
of the two are comparable. Thus we conclude here, based on the molecular
evidence, that the two taxa are conspeciﬁc. The next question is which name
was validly published ﬁrst. Both names were published in 1999. Paxillus validus

[@was proposed in Nova Hedwigia 69(1–2), published in August 1999 (according
to the subsequent journal issue). Paxillus ammoniavirescens was published in
Micologia e Vegetazione Mediterranea 13(2) with the nominal date “1998,” but
actually printed and distributed to libraries in Spring [northern hemisphere]
1999. Micologia e Vegetazione Mediterranea 13(2) arrived at L on May 20 1999,
whereas Nova Hedwigia 69(1–2) arrived on 28 October 1999. This indicates
that P. ammoniavirescens has priority as the correct name for this taxon.
Paxillus albidulus was described as ‘very similar’ to P. involutus but
distinguished from that species by the white pileus, stipe, ﬂesh, and basal
mycelium. Pigments were present in the hymenium, and the spore print was
‘ochreous to pale brown’ (Šutara 1992). At the time P. albidulus was described,
P. obscurosporus and P. ammoniavirescens had not yet been recognized as
separate species, but the basidiocarp stature and light spore print colour exclude
the possibility that P. albidulus is a close relative of either of these two species.
Hedh et al. (2008) were not able to get sequence data from P. albidulus, so its
identity will remain unresolved. However, the whitish collection (fig. 2) from
the U.K., also lacking pigments in pileus and stipe, ﬁts well into P. involutus I
(Fig. 1). Paxillus albidulus was reported from a predominantly coniferous forest,
and as this also ﬁts well with P. involutus I, we tentatively place P. albidulus in#Misc-exposition*]

that also ﬁts into P. involutus s. str. (Gelardi et al. 2011); that variant, described
as P. involutus f. eburneus Gelardi et al., has a yellow colouration lacking in the

[@The most common name used for Paxillus sequences deposited in GenBank
is P. involutus; however, in many cases this is not the correct name. The option for
third-party annotations is unfortunately not available, and this case emphasizes
the necessity for it (Bidartondo et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Most taxa are widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere,
but unfortunately there are very few data from Asia. Paxillus involutus I is
recorded from many European countries and North America (from Alaska to
Tennessee in the southeast). Paxillus involutus II is widespread in Europe (and
possibly also in boreal North America) but is better known from introduced
Betula planted in the urban areas of the North American western states
(Washington to California); its occurrence in the Great Smoky Mountains NP
(Tennessee) is also conﬁrmed (Fig. 1). Paxillus obscurosporus is widespread
in Europe and known from China (GenBank DQ647827, as ‘P. vernalis’).#Misc-exposition*]

Zealand. [Southern hemisphere Paxillus species have been shown to belong#Misc-exposition*]

[@to a separate lineage and family for which Bresinsky et al. (1999) erected
the genus Austropaxillus Bresinsky & Jarosch]. Vizzini (2008) identiﬁed a
Moroccan collection growing under Eucalyptus as P. ammoniavirescens. After
publication of Hahn & Agerer (1999) many more distribution and habitat data
have become available for P. ammoniavirescens and P. obscurosporus; Hahn &
Agerer’s speculations that these are introduced species in Europe no longer
seem to be justiﬁed, as both species have been recovered from native habitats
within Europe and records from outside Europe are scarce. Hedh et al. (2008,
2009), who recorded all four species from the same county in Sweden, have
shown that strains representing all four phylogenetic species were able to form
ectomycorrhizas with Betula and with Picea seedlings, but not all tested strains
succeeded in forming mycorrhizas and the success rate among strains varied
greatly as well. How the strains behave under natural conditions is, of course,
a diﬀerent question.#Misc-exposition*]
