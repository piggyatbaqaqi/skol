molecular systematics of Penicillium and a ﬁeld guide to the species of one
genus in one country for conservation purposes as extremes of one continuum.
Several publications stand out because of the high quality photos.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This work is signiﬁcant in two respects. First, with a publication date of 15
November 2011, it is the ﬁrst major work on the taxonomy of Trichocomaceae
to have appeared since the separate nomenclatural status of anamorph-typiﬁed
and teleomorph-typiﬁed names of pleomorphic fungi ended on 30 July 2011.
Second, it is a signiﬁcant contribution to the phylogenetic systematics of
Penicillium and Talaromyces in its own right, presenting the results of four fresh
studies.#Misc-exposition*]

phylogenetic system for not only penicillioid but also aspergilloid fungi. This

[@may come as a shock to some — with even two new families being recognized.
Molecular phylogenetic studies using several gene show that three families
are warranted: (1) Aspergillaceae for Aspergillus s. str. (syn. Eurotium, Fenellia,
Neocarpentales, Neosartorya, other teleomorphs, and Stilbothamnium),
Hamigera (incl. Merimbla), Leiothecium, Monascus (incl. Basipetospora),
Penicilliopsis, Penicillium s. str. (syn. Chromocleista, Citromyces, Eladia,
Eupenicillium, Hemicarpentales, Thysanophora, and Toluromyces), Phialomyces,
Phialosimplex, Polypaecilum, Sclerocleista, Warcupiella (incl. Raperia), and
Xeromyces; (2) Thermoascaceae for Paecilomyces (incl. Byssochlamys), and
Thermoascus (incl. Coonemeria, and Dactylomyces); and (3) Trichocomaceae
for Rasamsonia, Sagenomella, Talaromyces (incl. Erythrogymnotheca, and
Sagenoma), Thermomyces, Trichocoma, and tentatively for Dendrosphaera.
Four genera remained unplaced: Ascorhiza, Dichlaena, Pseudocordyceps, and
Sarophorum. While some might think the authors “jumped-the-gun,” as the
names Aspergillus and Penicillium are such widely used names compared
with those of the teleomorph-typiﬁed generic synonyms, the wording of the
Melbourne Code can be taken as indicating they were not obliged to have
this approved by the General Committee on Nomenclature established by the
Congress. In any event, there are no nomenclatural penalties for their choices,
which follow the rules applying to all non-pleomorphic fungi. Following this
revision of the familial and generic concepts and names, more detailed accounts
of the subgenera and sections of Penicillium, with detailed lists of the species to
be included in them, are presented.#Misc-exposition*]
[@This overview is followed by a critical revision of Penicillium sect. Citrina by
Houbraken, Frisvad & Samson, based on molecular phylogeny and physiology
(especially extrolites produced). Thirty-nine species are accepted, of which 17
are described as new. Extrolite proﬁles and calmodulin and β-tubulin sequences
can be used for species separations, but only about half of the species could
be unambiguously identiﬁed by ITS sequences alone. Rivera & Seifert address
the P. sclerotiorum complex with an equally critical and polyphasic approach,
recognizing seven species, of which three are newly described; in this case ITS
barcodes satisfactorily separated the taxa. The ﬁnal contribution by Samson
and seven colleagues addresses Talaromyces (incl. P. subgen. Biverticillium) and
considers all taxa described in the group; 69 species are accepted, one newly
described, many new combinations are made from Penicillium into the genus,
and a list of excluded names and synonyms is provided. As expected with Jens
Frisvad as one of the co-authors, detailed information is given on the extrolites,
with the “exometabolites” tabulated in detail.#Misc-exposition*]

one regret is that no culture or morphology based keys are included. This
means that it is becoming increasingly impossible to identify fungi in this

[@This modern treatment of the genus Lactarius in Estonia includes a short
introduction to the taxonomic placement of the genus, list of species recorded
for Estonia, an ecology chapter, illustrated overview of the main characters for
identiﬁcation, and a key to the species. The key, which is illustrated, is in both
Estonian and English. The main part of the book is taken up by the 60 species
descriptions, with short descriptions of another 22 that might exist in the
country. A glossary, list of references, and species index conclude the book.
Each species is presented by a good colour photo (often several) to illustrate
colour variation and development. There are no microscopic details depicted.
The text accompanying the photos covers sequence data, herbarium data, and
ample ecological details. Original data are used throughout. A short English
characterization of each species is very helpful for non-Estonian speakers.
The number of species is smaller than that treated in the work by HeilmannClausen et al. (1998) for northern Europe. But the extra information, the high
quality photos, and the low price make this a good choice. In short, a well
executed, well researched and very valuable contribution to our knowledge of
milk caps.#Misc-exposition*]

fossil fungi, Chytridiomycota are treated by Powell and Letcher (Chapter 3),
and Benny gives an overview of the Zygomycota, their systematics, and possible

systematics of the two largest genera of the Harpellales (Stachylina and Smittium)
along with keys and species descriptions. Chapter 7 focuses on two genera of
edible mushrooms, Morchella and Macrolepiota, in Israel, and Barseghyan et

describe no new species. Chapter 8 highlights morphological characters that
distinguish groups of mushroom forming fungi, and authors Zmitrovich &
Wasser warn that groupings based solely on RNA genes should be considered
with skepticism. Tura et al. (chapter 9) gives an overview of Phellinus s.l. and

[@It is a pleasure to leaf through this book full of good mushroom photos from
tropical China. In total 495 species are depicted, out of the 2065 listed for the
area in the back. The book, authored by ﬁve mycologists and written in Chinese
with Latin nomenclature and English chapter headings, gives an overview of
the habitats (with their fungi), a checklist of all tropical fungi in China, and an
extensive reference list; the main part of the book is devoted to species photos
and descriptions. On the right hand page are two or three photos opposite the
description on the even numbered pages. The majority of the taxa belong to
the basidiomycetes. The species are ordered according to their phylogenetic
position, for instance Auriscalpium can be found near the genus Russula. It
is really nice to see so many ectomycorrhizal species depicted; Amanita, for
instance, is well represented by 37 species and at least 35 species of boletes are
included. Among the wood inhabiting fungi, Ganoderma stands out with 30
species, while stinkhorns in all their weird beautiful shapes and colours are
represented by 21 species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@It is obvious that in some groups, names from species described from other
regions have been applied to southeastern Asian specimens and are not always
correct. Two such misapplied names are ‘Lactarius deliciosus’ and ‘Anthurus
archeri,’ and the photo of Suillus bovinus does not look typical for that species.
Most species have been photographed in the ﬁeld, but lab photos have been
used for a very small number.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The book shows the diversity and richness of fungi in tropical China, and
can certainly be used outside China. I encountered many taxa that are familiar
from northern Thailand. I am looking forward to seeing an English translation
of this book to make it more accessible to the rest of the world.#Misc-exposition*]
