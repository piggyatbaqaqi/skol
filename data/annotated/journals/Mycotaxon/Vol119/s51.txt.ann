[@Abstract — A new species, Herpothallon weii, is described from China. This species is
characterized by a byssoid whitish green thallus tightly attached to the substratum, pinkish
pseudisidia, and the presence of psoromic acid and unknown substances.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Herpothallon (Arthoniaceae, Arthoniales, Arthoniomycetes, Ascomycota) was
established by Tobler in 1937 and reinstated by Aptroot et al. (2009). The lichen
genus is characterized by a crustose thallus without upper cortex, a byssoid
prothallus, and a trentepohlioid photobiont. Herpothallon species often have
pseudisidia or pseudisidioid structures, calcium oxalate crystals, pigments,
and various lichen substances, but usually lack ascocarps. Cryptothecia species,
which are morphologically similar to Herpothallon species, have an I+ blue
medulla. Of Herpothallon, only six species (H. biacidum, H. ﬂavominutum,
H. granulosum, H. isidiatum, H. philippinum, and H. rubroechinatum) have an
I+ blue medulla (Aptroot et al. 2009, Frisch et al. 2010a,b, Jagadeesh & Sinha
2009, Jagadeesh et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Herpothallon includes 35 species worldwide (Aptroot et al. 2009, Frisch et
al. 2010a,b, Jagadeesh & Sinha 2009, Jagadeesh et al. 2009). In China, three
Herpothallon species, H. echinatum, H. granulare, and H. philippinum have
been reported (Aptroot et al. 2009). During our study of the lichen ﬂora of Mt.
Leigong in Guizhou province, China, a species of Herpothallon new to science
was found.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The specimens studied were collected from Guizhou, China, and are preserved
in SDNU (Lichen Section of Botanical Herbarium, Shandong Normal University).#Misc-exposition*]

[@440 ... Cheng & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The morphological and anatomical characters of the specimens were examined using
a stereo microscope (COIC XTL7045B2) and a polarizing microscope (OLYMPUS
CX41). Lichen substances in the specimen cited were identiﬁed using the standardized
thin layer chromatography techniques (TLC) with C system (Orange et al. 2010). Photos
of the thalli were taken using a Olympus SZX12 with DP72.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Etymology: In honour of the 80th birthday (6 Nov. 2011) of our dear teacher, Prof.

contribution to the development of lichenology and the education of Chinese talent in
this ﬁeld.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thallus corticolous, crustose, tightly attached, ≤ 1.5 cm in diam., without
upper cortex, distinctly byssoid, whitish green, with irregular calcium oxalate
crystals. Prothallus distinct, ≤ 0.5 mm wide, white, byssoid, composed of
radiating hyphae. Pseudisidia (also called pseudisidioid structure) numerous,
pinkish, irregularly cushion-shaped, ﬂuﬀy-felty with erect hyphae, ≤ 1 × 0.5
mm. Photobiont cells single or a few cells aggregated. Apothecia and pycnidia
not seen.#Description*]
[@Chemistry — Thallus K+ yellow, C± yellow, KC+ yellow, P+ yellow, I–,
UV–. Psoromic acid and unknown substances present.#Description*]
[@Distribution and substrate — Herpothallon weii is known only from the
type locality; on bark.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Additional specimen examined — CHINA. Guizhou province, Mt. Leigong, on
bark, alt. 1000 m, 2 Nov. 2009, Q. Tian, 20103174 (SDNU).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — Other Herpothallon species with pseudisidia and psoromic
acid include H. australasicum, H. echinatum, H. ﬂavominutum, H. globosum,
H. rubroechinatum, and H. albidum. In contrast to H. weii, H. australasicum
has a red thallus with concolorous compact pseudisidia; H. echinatum has
soredioid fragments and concolourous pseudisidia and thallus; H. ﬂavominutum
has a greyish yellow thallus, granular pseudisidia, and lichexanthone,
norlichexanthone, and psoromic acid; H. globosum has a red thallus, globose
pseudisidia, and chiodectonic acid (red pigment); and H. rubroechinatum has
an orange to red thallus, pseudisidia with red hairs, and common pycnidia. The
more closely related H. albidum possesses very similar pseudisidia (also called
pseudisidioid structures) but has white, rather than pinkish, pseudisidia and
possesses pigmentosin D.#Misc-exposition*]
