[@Abstract—Xylaria atroglobosa (Xylariales, Xylariaceae) is described from China as a new
species. It is characterized by its semi-globose stromata and ascospores with an appendage on
one end. Photographs of stromata and microstructures are provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The southern provinces of China are characterized by a high diversity of
Xylaria species, and many species known only from southeastern Asia have
been found in southern China. Xylaria badia Pat., described from the Gulf of
Tonkin area in Vietnam (Patouillard 1891), has been reported from Taiwan (Ju
& Rogers 1999), Thailand (Thienhirun & Whalley 2004, Okane et al. 2008),
Malaysia (Whalley & Whalley 2007), and China’s Yunnan Province (Ma 2011).
Xylaria bambusicola Y.M. Ju & J.D. Rogers, described from Taiwan (Ju &
Rogers 1999), is found in Thailand (Okane et al. 2008) and Yunnan Province
(Ma 2011). Xylaria brunneovinosa Y.M. Ju & H.M. Hsieh is only known from
Taiwan (Ju & Hsieh 2007) and Yunnan Province (Ma 2011); X. copelandii
Henn., restricted to Calamus spp. and described from Philippines (Hennings
1908), has been reported from China’s Guangdong Province (Ma 2011); and X.
papulis Lloyd was described from China (Lloyd 1921) and later found in Papua
New Guinea (Van der Gucht 1995), Philippines, Taiwan (Ju & Rogers 1999),
and Thailand (Okane et al. 2008). A much longer list, including two recently
described new species, X. choui H.X. Ma et al. and X. ﬁcicola H.X. Ma et al. (Ma
et al. 2011a,b), would demonstrate the very unique species composition of the#Misc-exposition*]

in the south of China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Collection, preservation, and identiﬁcation methods follow Ju and Rogers (1999).
Microscopic features and measurements were made from slide preparations mounted
in water and Melzer’s reagent. The photographs of the asci, ascal apical ring, and
ascospores were taken by using a VHX-600E microscope of the Keyence Corporation.
The photographs of stromatal surface were taken with a ZSA30w microscope and
S70 Canon camera. The studied specimen is deposited at the Herbarium of Kunming
Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences (HKAS).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stroma hemispherical to depressed-spherical, attached to substrate with
narrow connective, 3–6 mm high × 0.6–1.2 cm diam., externally black,
internally white, woody, texture hard, surface smooth and perithecial mounds
inconspicuous; perithecia embedded in stromata, spherical, 0.5–0.8 mm diam.;
ostioles papillate. Asci 8-spored, cylindrical, long-stipitate, the spore-bearing
part 150–170 µm long, with apical ring bluing in Melzer’s iodine reagent,
urn-shaped, 4.5–5 × 3.5–5 µm. Ascospores brown, unicellular, ellipsoidinequilateral to crescent-shaped to navicular, with broadly to narrowly rounded
ends, bearing a round hyaline noncellular appendage up to 6–7 × 3–4 µm at the
one end, smooth, (24–)24.5–27(–29) × 7.5–9 µm, with oblique germ slit much
less than spore-length.#Description*]
[@Comments– Xylaria atroglobosa is similar to X. fraseri M.A. Whalley et al.
(Whalley et al. 2000) in stromatal morphology and ascospore size, although
its ascospores are slightly shorter. However, the stromata of X. atroglobosa#Misc-exposition*]

[@lack white scales or a peeling layer at the surface, whereas stromata of
X. fraseri are overlaid with a white to yellowish white peeling layer cracked
into 0.2–0.4 mm broad scales. Furthermore, the ascospores of X. fraseri lack
an appendage and their germ slit is straight.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In stromatal morphology, the new species somewhat resembles X. atrosphaerica (Cooke & Massee) Callan & J.D. Rogers, which can be diﬀerentiated#Misc-exposition*]
