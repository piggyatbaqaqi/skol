[@Abstract — A new family (Intraornatosporaceae), two new genera (Intraornatospora,
Paradentiscutata), two new species (P. bahiana, P. maritima), and a new combination
(I. intraornata) are presented in the Gigasporales. The genera, both with diagnostic introverted
ornamentations on the spore wall, are distinguished by spore wall structure and germ
shield characteristics. The new species, detected in NE Brazil, can be diﬀerentiated by their
projections on the outer spore surface. Partial sequences of the LSU rRNA gene place both
species next to I. intraornata in a monophyletic major clade related to Gigasporaceae and
Dentiscutataceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The phylum Glomeromycota has been extensively revised in recent years
at all classiﬁcation levels from class to species (e.g. Morton & Redecker 2001,
Sieverding & Oehl 2006, Palenzuela et al. 2008, Goto et al. 2010, 2011, Oehl
et al. 2011a,b,c). Major revisions were necessary within the order Gigasporales
when separating Gigasporaceae species into four families (Gigasporaceae,
Scutellosporaceae, Racocetraceae and Dentiscutataceae) and Scutellospora into
seven genera when concomitant morphological and molecular spore analyses
were undertaken (Oehl et al. 2008, 2010, 2011b,c). It was initially clear that
Dentiscutataceae, in particular, was a heterogeneous family that needed more#Misc-exposition*]

[@detailed study (Oehl et al. 2008). Unfortunately, little progress has been made
due to only a limited number of available isolates.#Misc-exposition*]
[@During recent studies on the diversity of the arbuscular mycorrhizal
(AM) fungi (Glomeromycota) in Northeastern Brazil, Dentiscutata colliculosa
B.T. Goto & Oehl, Racocetra intraornata, and two undescribed species were
detected (Goto et al. 2009, 2010). All four species have introverted projections
on the spore wall. The phylogenetic position of R. intraornata, however,
remained unresolved while the two new species appeared to belong to the
Dentiscutataceae, based on their spore formation on sporogenous cells and the
presence of yellow brown to brown shields on the inner spore walls. Moreover,
two major morphological characters separated these two new species within
the Dentiscutataceae — the multiple-lobed structure of their openly organized
shields and the presence of a tuberculate ornamentation on the inner surface of
the hyaline middle spore wall. A multiple-lobed structure of openly organized
shields has been detected only in the Racocetraceae, where shields are hyaline to
sub-hyaline. Ornamentation on the inner surface of the middle wall is hitherto
a unique character shared with no other species within the Glomeromycota.
Racocetra intraornata, however, was understood to have a rather rudimentary
germination shield where germ tube initiations are rarely found. The question
therefore arose whether this species truly belongs to Racocetra, or might have
a diﬀerent phylogeny.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The main aim of this study was thus to analyze thoroughly and describe the
two new species and to elucidate their phylogenetic position as well as that of
R. intraornata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Study areas, soil sampling and soil parameters#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of the two new AM species was recovered in Serra da Jibóia, a fragment of the
Atlantic Rainforest (‘Mata Atlântica’) in Santa Terezinha, Bahia State. The other species
was found in several locations in the sand dunes of Mataraca, Paraíba State, (Souza et
al. 2010, 2012) and in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte State. In the Serra da Jibóia, the soils
were taken in September 2010, in Mataraca in January and August 2005, and in Natal in
February 2010, as described in (Souza et al. 2010, 2012).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The Serra da Jibóia (12°51ʹS 39°28ʹW) is a forest fragment characterized by high
plant diversity (Queiroz et al. 1996) located on a hillside surrounded by drier areas
in transition to Caatinga (dry forest with trees and shrubs, deciduous during the dry
season; Andrade-Lima 1964). Mean annual temperature is 17–28°C with 1200 mm
of rain falling between April and July (Tomasoni & Santos 2003). The sand dunes in
Mataraca are located at 6°28ʹ–6°30ʹS 34°55ʹ–34°57ʹW. The vegetation is typical of
‘restinga,’ a transition ecosystem between the primary coastal sand dunes and the tropical
Atlantic Rainforest with physiognomy varying from tree-shrub to herbaceous plants
(Oliveira-Filho & Carvalho 1993). The predominant geological formation is sandy-clay#Misc-exposition*]

[@sedimentary rocks, superimposed by ﬁxed dunes. The climate is tropical-(semi-)humid
(type Am of Köppen-Geiger, Kottek et al. 2006) with four months of dry season. Average
annual temperature is 24–28°C and rainfall 1795 mm. The sand dunes in Natal represent
one of the largest urban conservation areas with dune vegetation in Brazil. The ‘Parque das
Dunas’ site (5°46ʹS and 35°12ʹW) also has typical ‘restinga’ vegetation. The climate is
tropical rainy (type Am of Köppen) with a short dry period of four months. The mean
annual temperature is 25.5 °C, and the mean annual precipitation is 1191 mm.
Soil pH (H20) in Santa Terezinha was 4.6, organic C was 21.5 g kg-1 and available P
(after Mehlich; Nelson et al. 1953) 2.0 mg kg-1. In Mataraca, soil pH was 5.6, organic C
25.0 g kg-1 and available P 6.5 mg kg-1. In Natal, pH was 5.6, organic C 16.6 mg kg-1, and
available P was 3.0 mg kg-1. Soils in all three areas were sandy.#Misc-exposition*]
[@AM fungal bait cultures#Misc-exposition*]

[@The native AM fungal communities from Serra da Jibóia and Mataraca were cultured
in bait (= trap) cultures over three consecutive cycles (three months each) using corn
(Zea mays L.), peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and sunﬂower (Helianthus annuus L.) in
500 mL pots, ﬁlled with autoclaved sand-vermiculite substrate (1:1 w/w; 400 g per
pot) mixed with the natural ﬁeld soil as AM fungal inoculum (50 g per pot), in the
greenhouse of the Department of Mycology, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,
Recife. Additionally, multiple glomerospores of the new species were separated and
used as infective propagules in single species cultures on Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench
as described in Palenzuela et al. (2010), Tchabi et al. (2010), and Goto et al. (2011). The
new Serra da Jibóia species was successfully propagated in a two-species culture together
with Ambispora appendicula, and the sand dune species in a bait culture together with
Racocetra tropicana (Goto et al. 2011). However, no single species cultures were obtained
from the two fungi. Spores isolated from the cultures or directly obtained from the ﬁeld
samples were used for morphological and molecular analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphological analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores of the two new species and R. intraornata were extracted according to
Sieverding (1991) and thereafter mounted in polyvinyl-alcohol–lacto–glycerin (PVLG),
in PVLG + Melzer’s reagent, and in water (Brundrett et al. 1994, Spain 1990). Over
100 spores were examined per species. The germination shields of each species were
carefully separated from their spores by applying pressure and movements to cover
slides in PVLG. Species descriptions utilize spore and germination terminology for
gigasporalean species deﬁned by Oehl et al. (2008, 2010, 2011b), Silva et al. (2008), and
Goto et al. (2010, 2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA was extracted from single spores, with three single spore extractions for each
of the two new species and one for R. intraornata. Individual spores were placed on a
slide in a drop (5–10 µl) of ultrapure water, crushed with a needle, and used directly in
the PCR reactions.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The extracts served as templates for a semi-nested PCR using primers ITS3 (White et
al. 1990) – 28G2 (Silva et al. 2006) and LR1 (van Tuinen et al. 1998) – 28G2 consecutively.
The template for the second PCR reaction was a 1:50 dilution of the ﬁrst product. PCR
reactions were carried out in a volume of 50 µl, containing 75 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 200#Misc-exposition*]

each other.#Description*]
[@Inner wall (iw) is triple-layered bearing a germination shield on the
outer surface. Outer layer of the inner wall (iwl1) is hyaline, semi-ﬂexible and

tightly adherent to iwl2, and diﬃcult to observe. iwl2 stains reddish-brown to
purple in Melzer’s reagent.#Description*]

cell, continuous with owl1 and owl2. owl1 on the sporogenous cell is about
0.5–1.6 µm; adherent owl2 is about 2.5–7.6(–10.2) µm thick. The ornamentation
on owl1 does not continue on the wall of the sporogenous cell. The pore of the
sporogenous cell is generally closed at the septum to the attached ‘sporogenous
hypha’ by a septum arising from owl2.#Description*]

by large folds. These folds (about 5–15 µm long) arise from the shield wall. The
one-layered shield wall and the folds are generally only 0.5–1.7 µm thick. Each
lobe regularly bears one rounded germ tube initiation, 1.2–2.5 µm in diameter,

[@whether the middle wall forms completely de novo or diﬀerentiates from a thin
layer present on the inner surface of the outer wall, we did observe that during
spore formation mwl1 diﬀerentiates ﬁrst, showing several laminae when
exposed to PVLG and other lactic acid based mountants. mwl2 diﬀerentiates
on the inner surface of developed mwl1. Thereafter, iw is formed de novo, and,
in the ﬁnal stage of spore development the germination shield diﬀerentiates on
the outer IW surface.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Distinct spore morphologies were recognized for both Paradentiscutata
and Intraornatospora. Paradentiscutata spp. have three-walled spores with a
diagnostic tuberculate ornamentation on the inner surface of the middle wall
and an openly organized, multiple-lobed, yellow-brown to brown germination
shield on the outer iw surface. Intraornatospora intraornata has a tuberculate
ornamentation of the inner ow surface, and on the outer iw surface a multiple
lobed, hyaline to light yellow germination shield that regularly appears to be
rudimentary even in older spores, since clearly visible germ tube initiations have
rarely been found (Figs 2–4). Germination itself has yet to be observed in spores#Misc-exposition*]

[@130 ... Goto & al.#Page-header*]
[@of this species, so we do not know whether I. intraornata germinates through
the rudimentary germ shield or directly from the warty inner projections of the
outer wall (as in Gigaspora). The two new genera, morphologically somewhat
dissimilar, might better be separated into two families. However, the database
so far is too small to make a ﬁnal conclusion on this aspect.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The two Paradentiscutata spp. can easily be distinguished through their
ornamentation on the outer spore surface, a character that clearly separates
species in other glomeromycete families (e.g., Racocetra verrucosa and
R. persica, Dentiscutata nigra and D. reticulata, Acaulospora scrobiculata and
A. cavernata; Oehl et al. 2008, 2011d). Of the Gigasporales species, P. maritima
resembles only Dentiscutata biornata, which diﬀers in a compact germination
shield with multiple (12–24) compartments in mature spores (Figs 32–35)
that are not openly organized or multiple-lobed (Spain et al. 1989) as in
P. maritima, which has 4–8(–10) lobes. Additionally, the double ornamentation
of D. biornata belongs to the outer spore wall according to Spain et al. (1989).
These important morphological diﬀerences point out species dissemblance and
support the new speciation. However, further research may consider checking
the phylogenetic relationships between D. biornata and the two new species.
Species of Intraornatosporaceae, Dentiscutataceae, and Gigasporaceae are
predominantly found in warmer climates. The Intraornatosporaceae have so far
been detected only in tropical areas, while Dentiscutataceae spp. are known
also from sub-tropical and Mediterranean regions and Gigasporaceae spp. have
at times been recovered from temperate regions (Jansa et al. 2002, Oehl et al.
2010). It is possible that Dentiscutataceae and Gigasporaceae may have evolved
to cooler periods and climates than Intraornatosporaceae. Further AM fungal
diversity research will also help verify this hypothesis.#Misc-exposition*]
