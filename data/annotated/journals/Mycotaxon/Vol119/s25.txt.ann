[@Abstract — A new species, Marasmiellus milicae, is described from the Mediterranean
part of Croatia and compared with similar species. It is characterized by having rather
small, white pileus, distinctly to strongly eccentric, curved, short stipe, white hymenophore
becoming dark brown when dry, (sub)amygdaloid basidiospores, mostly diverticulate
cheilocystidia, pileipellis and stipitipellis with strongly developed Rameales-structure, and
gelatinized trama. Color photographs and line drawings of microscopic elements and
basidiomata accompany the description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@During the last decade of intensive research of Croatian Basidiomycota,
a signiﬁcant number of rare and new species has been found. Some of these
have been published in the last few years (Hausknecht et al. 2007; Mešić &
Tkalčec 2008, 2009; Tkalčec & Mešić 2008; Tkalčec et al. 2009) and the
remaining will be published in a series of papers under the title “Studies on
Croatian Basidiomycota,” of which this is the second. In the present paper we
describe a new species of Marasmiellus (Omphalotaceae, Agaricales) found in
the Mediterranean part of Croatia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The description of Marasmiellus milicae is based on two collections consisting of
27 basidiomata in total. The macroscopic description is based on fresh basidiomata.
Microscopic features are described from dried material mounted in potassium hydroxide
(KOH) solution and Melzer’s reagent, and observed with a light microscope (brightﬁeld
and phase contrast – PhC) under magniﬁcation up to 1500×. Spore measurements do
not include the apiculus. Arithmetic means of spores length and width are shown in
italic font in the center of the measurements. The length/width ratio of all measured
spores is given as the “Q” value (min. – av. – max.), and the range of arithmetic averages#Misc-exposition*]

are deposited in the Croatian National Fungarium, Zagreb, Croatia (CNF), while an
isotype is deposited in the Herbarium of the Moravian Museum, Brno, Czech Republic
(BRNM).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Marasmiellus milicae is characterized by having a rather small,
white pileus, distinctly to strongly eccentric, curved, short, dark stipe, white
hymenophore becoming dark brown when dry, (sub)amygdaloid basidiospores,
mostly diverticulate cheilocystidia, pileipellis and stipitipellis with strongly
developed Rameales-structure, and gelatinized trama. Having those characters,
it belongs to sect. Distantifolii Singer (Singer 1973). So far, it has been collected
only in Croatia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Several marasmielloid species with similar shape of basidiomata are
known in Europe. Among the white colored species, Gymnopus sphaerosporus
M. Villarreal et al. and Marasmiellus margaritifer (Maire) Singer have a
white stipe, globose or subglobose basidiospores, and diﬀerent cheilocystidia
(Antonín & Noordeloos 2010). From the white colored species of section
Distantifolii, Marasmiellus distantifolius (Murrill) Singer, known from the USA,
Central and South America, especially diﬀers by a pure white stipe, distinctly
longer basidiospores ((8.5–)10.2–16 × 3–5.5(–6) µm according to Singer 1973;
11.5–14.5 × 4–5.5 µm according to Pegler 1977, 1997), and smaller cheilocystidia
(20–25 × 4.5 µm); M. corticum Singer, described from the USA, diﬀers by a
shortly radially ferrugineous-brown or ochraceous-brown striped pileus
on drying, and smaller ((7–)14–21.5 × (5–)7–9.5 µm), diﬀerently shaped
cheilocystidia (Singer 1973). Marasmiellus afer Pegler, collected in tropical
Africa, has a lateral, rarely absent stipe and narrower (8.2–10.8 × 3–4 µm),
lacrymoid basidiospores (Pegler 1967, 1977). Marasmiellus tristis (G. Stev.)
E. Horak (= Campanella tristis (G. Stev.) Segedin) from New Zealand diﬀers
by its pileus turning glaucous or greenish-gray with age, a dirty yellowish
hymenophore when dry, spores with lower Q value (1.4), and the absence of#Misc-exposition*]
