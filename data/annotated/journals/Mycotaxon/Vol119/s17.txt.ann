[@Abstract — Candelariella kuusamoensis, Ochrolechia frigida, Physcia phaea, and Xanthoria
papillifera were determined as new to Turkey and the Middle East following a recent
lichenological foray in Iğdır and Van regions (Turkey). Geographic distribution, substrate,
chemistry, and comparisons with morphologically similar taxa are presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although many lichen taxa have recently been recorded for Turkey (Candan
et al. 2010, Candan & Halici 2009, Halici et al. 2010a,b, Kinalioglu 2009,
Kinalioğlu & Aptroot 2010, Kinalioglu 2010a,b,c, Karagöz et al. 2011, PerezOrtega et al. 2010, Yazici & Aslan 2009, 2010a,b), the lichen biota of many
regions are still unknown. No lichenized fungi have thus far been reported for
the Iğdır region, although some surveys of lichens have been conducted in the
neighbouring Ardahan region (Osyczka et al. 2011, Yazici et al. 2010a,b) and
81 taxa were reported from the Van province (Aslan & Öztürk 1995, Szatala
1941, 1960, Şenkardeşler & Lökös 2010). Ten Candelariella, ﬁfteen Ochrolechia,
sixteen Physcia, and twelve Xanthoria taxa have previously been reported from
Turkey.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The climate of the Iğdır region is characterized by hot dry summers and
cold snowy winters. The mean annual temperature is 11.6°C, average humidity
is 63%, and the mean annual rainfall is about 257.6 mm. Summers are
characterized by moderate precipitation and the winters are generally marked
with high precipitation (Akman 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The Iğdır region has few forested areas and is dominated by steppe. Mountain
Zordağ (Iğdır: Center), which is exposed to high light conditions, is a windswept#Misc-exposition*]

[@150 ... Yazıcı, Aptroot & Aslan#Page-header*]
[@area with gently sloping terrain dominated by grass, rocks, and streams with
scattered coniferous and deciduous trees. Prunus, Pyrus, Populus, Salix, and
Elaeagnus trees are seen occasionally along the stream between Taşköprü and
Karaca villages (Tuzluca) (Baytop & Denizci 1963). There are no trees but many
calcareous and siliceous rocks in the Taşucan and Bahçecik villages, an exposed
windswept area.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The Van region has a continental climate, characterized by long cold snowy
winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 9°C, average
humidity is 51.10% , and the mean annual rainfall is about 380 mm, with a
precipitation range of 370–570 mm (Akman 1999). The collection sites are
exposed to high light conditions and windswept with gently sloping terrain
comprising grass and volcanic calcareous rocks. A river valley with trees was
sampled only in Saray town (Van). In the other regions of the Van district there
are no deciduous or coniferous trees (Baytop & Denizci 1963).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@During a recent lichenological research foray in Iğdır and Van regions (Turkey),
lichen samples were collected from 07 December 2008 to 27 September 2009 and 13
June 2010 to 12 July 2010. Air-dried samples were examined with a Nikon SMZ1500
stereomicroscope and a Nikon Eclipse 80i light microscope. Identiﬁcations were
determined by consulting appropriate keys in the literature (Brodo et al. 2001, Dobson
2005, Kärnefelt 1990, Kukwa 2009, Moberg 1977, Poelt 1974, Poelt & Vězda 1981,
Redchenko et al. 2010, Smith et al. 2009, Thomson 1997, Wetmore 2005, Wirth 1995).
Secondary metabolites were identiﬁed by the usual spot tests.#Misc-exposition*]
