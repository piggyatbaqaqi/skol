[@Abstract — A new corticioid genus, Radulomycetopsis, is described for the new species,
R. cystidiata, from West Kameng in Arunachal Pradesh.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words — Eastern Himalaya, Bomdila, angiosperm host#Misc-exposition*]

[@While conducting a fungal foray in Bomdila in West Kameng of Arunachal
Pradesh, India, Dhingra made a collection on decaying angiospermous
branches. The macroscopic and microscopic characters were compared with
similar genera in Corticiaceae (Rattan 1977, Thind & Dhingra 1985, Eriksson et
al. 1981, Hjortstam et al. 1987) but could not be assigned to any already known,
hence the description of a new genus. Morphological traits show similarities
with Radulomyces.#Misc-exposition*]

Radulomycetopsis diﬀers in having dark colored fruitbodies, hyphae without
clamps, and presence of cystidia, a combination of features that supports an
independent genus. A sample has been studied by Prof. Kurt Hjortstam, who
supports the concept of a new genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiocarp resupinate, adnate, eﬀused, up to 430 µm thick in section,
membranous-ceraceous; hymenial surface smooth to slightly tuberculate,
orange to brownish orange to reddish brown when fresh, becoming orange
gray to grayish orange to brownish orange on drying; margins thinning,
irregular in outline, ﬁbrillose. Hyphal system monomitic; generative hyphae
up to 3 µm wide, thin-walled, branched at wide angles, septate, without clamps;
basal zone composed of sparsely branched hyphae, running almost parallel to
the substrate, covered with some brownish-red matter which dissolves in 3%#Description*]

[@KOH, followed by a zone of comparatively more richly branched, loosely and
irregularly interwoven hyphae which merge into the hymenial zone where the
hyphae become vertical and much branched forming a dense texture. Cystidia
70.0–85.0 × 9.0–11.0 µm, cylindrical to sub cylindrical, thin- to somewhat
thick-walled, projecting up to 50 µm out of the hymenium. Some simple to
slightly branched hyphoid structures, are also observed in the hymenium. These
are thin-walled, with oily contents, and look diﬀerent from dendrohyphidia.
Basidia 25.0–37.0 × 7.0–8.5 µm, clavate to subclavate, often constricted with
oily contents, 4-sterigmate, with no basal clamp; sterigmata up to 7.0 µm long.
Basidiospores 6.0–9.0 × 5–7.25 µm, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose, thin- to
slightly thick-walled, inamyloid, acyanophilous, uniguttulate or with many oil
drops.#Description*]
[@Remarks—Radulomycetopsis cystidiata is similar to Radulomyces conﬂuens,
which is easily distinguished by the presence of clamp connections and absence
of cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
