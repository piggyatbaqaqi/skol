[@Abstract — Four new species of polypores are described from California, Oregon, and
Washington, U.S.A. Antrodia madronae, seemingly conﬁned to dead stems and branches
of Arbutus menziesii, is closely related to European Antrodia sandaliae growing on Arbutus
unedo. The generic position is evaluated for Ceriporiopsis pseudoplacenta, a strikingly colored
species with many unique features that seems surprisingly common in the northwestern
states. Fuscoporia palomari is distinguished from the similar F. viticola by much larger pores
and spores. Skeletocutis subodora diﬀers from S. odora by having thick subiculum, diﬀerently
shaped basidiospores, abundant cystidioles, and no skeletal hyphae in the context. The
nrDNA ITS region of all new species gave unique sequences in GenBank.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The forested west coast of the United States is extremely biodiverse due
to its varied topography, climate zones, and geology. The number of vascular
plant species found in California exceeds the total number from the central
and northeastern United States and adjacent Canada, an area ten times larger
(CI 2007). The high degree of plant endemism is also striking; more than 61%
of Californian plant species are found nowhere else in the world. This creates
favorable conditions also for high diversity and endemism of wood-bound
poroid fungi. Nevertheless, in the North American polypore monograph by
Gilbertson & Ryvarden (1986, 1987), only 60 (of 406) species are speciﬁed
as occurring in the western states of California, Oregon, and Washington.
This indicates that the region still has a great potential for ﬁeld research in
polyporology.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Few substantial contributions have been published on USA west coast
polypores since Murrill’s early papers (Murrill 1912, 1915). Overholts, who#Misc-exposition*]

[@described several new species sent to him from the Paciﬁc coast states, never
collected in the far west (Overholts 1939). The same is essentially true for
Lowe and other distinguished USA polyporologists. Gilbertson (1976, 1979),
who published some new species and important distribution data, focused his
research primarily on the dry hot regions of Arizona.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We visited various localities on the USA west coast and report here on
several polypore collections. Although the collected material was quite scarce,
we describe four new species supported by distinctive macro- and microscopic
features and unique ITS rRNA sequences.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Polypores were collected in August (2001, 2003), September (2005, 2009), and April
(2010) during one-week trips to various localities in California, Oregon, and Washington
(Vlasák 2008). The specimens were dried and microscopically inspected in Melzer’s
reagent (IKI) and 5 % KOH. Similar fungi from other parts of USA and Europe were also
collected or loaned from herbaria and studied in detail as noted in ‘Specimens studied.’
All collected specimens are deposited in private herbarium of the ﬁrst author, with types
and some paratypes also in PRM. DNA isolation from critical samples, nr DNA ITS
region sequencing, and comparative phylogenetic analyses methods follow Vlasák &
Kout (2011). The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method
(Saitou & Nei 1987) and phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA4 (Tamura et
al. 2007).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments — More material is needed to describe the extent of macroscopic
variation of this species. The description is based on only two specimens; the
type is a small, resupinate basidiocarp in the wood-crevice of a dead, broken
branch of a living tree, while the other, growing on a dead standing tree, is a
large, partly pileate basidiocarp with a strikingly rugose pileus surface but old
and heavily damaged by insects (Plate 4). Antrodia madronae is characterized
by large cylindrical basidiospores, rather soft fruitbodies dominated by
generative hyphae, extremely soft trama that almost dissolved during the
microscopic preparation in Melzer’s reagent, large pores, and causing a brown
rot. Undoubtedly, the fungus is closely related to the Mediterranean A. sandaliae
Bernicchia & Ryvarden, also growing on an arbutus (Arbutus unedo L.) and
characterized by a white pulvinate basidiome, similar soft trama and hyphal
system, and similarly shaped but smaller basidiospores (7.5–10.0 × 1.8–3.0
µm; Bernicchia & Ryvarden 2001, Gorjón & Bernicchia 2009). Although both
species have KOH-soluble thick-walled hyphae, the pores, basidia and spores of
A. madronae are distinctly larger and the basidiome is varicolored.
Sequence analysis — The ampliﬁed ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA region of A. madronae
was 565b long between ITS1 and ITS4 primer sequences (White et al. 1990) and
the sequence was rather similar to that of A. sandaliae HUBO 7803 and HUBO
7784. The sequence variation between A. madronae and A. sandaliae of 2.0%
(4/199) in ITS1 and 2.4% (5/212) in ITS2 suggests a very close relationship
regardless of the pronounced macroscopical diﬀerences. Other species in
GenBank Blast Search are only distantly related, with A. albobrunnea (Romell)
Ryvarden (max. 83% sequence similarity) seemingly the closest.

[@Comments — Ceriporiopsis pseudoplacenta is probably widely distributed
in the western USA, as we found it in various locations during every trip to
California and Washington (Vlasák 2008). One specimen comes also from the
Great Smoky Mt., Tennessee. It is diﬃcult to understand why this strikingly
colored fungus has not previously been described, yet we found nothing similar
in the literature. In the ﬁeld, C. pseudoplacenta can be mistaken for Auriporia
aurea (Peck) Ryvarden or Postia placenta (Fr.) M.J. Larsen & Lombard because#Misc-exposition*]

[@of similar colors and soft, ﬂeshy consistency. Auriporia aurea (and the similar
European A. aurulenta A. David, Tortič & Jelić) diﬀer by having skeletal hyphae
and thick-walled cystidia. Postia placenta is diﬃcult to separate by microscopy
alone because both species have similar hyphal system with no special
structures and similar spores that are, however, smaller in C. pseudoplacenta.
Macroscopical diﬀerences are more distinctive, especially when monitoring
basidiome changes during development and drying. Postia placenta starts
growing usually as a deep-red basidiome, changing to rosy-pink and, when
old or dry, to whitish-pink or light ochre. C. pseudoplacenta follows just the
opposite coloration steps; it starts as whitish or light salmon pink, becoming
increasingly more deeply red until maturing to red brownish or black in the
subiculum and margin. Also, the consistency of dried fruitbodies is quite
diﬀerent: soft and brittle in P. placenta but tough and rubber-like (reminiscent of
beef jerky) in C. pseudoplacenta. Auriporia aurea, A. aurulenta, and P. placenta
cause a dry brown rot. The wood under C. pseudoplacenta basidiomes is usually
also quite dark as the fungus causes some red-brownish wood coloration, but
its stringy ﬁbrous structure with small pockets corresponds more to white
rot. Unfortunately, we did not perform oxidase tests on fresh fruitbodies.
Ceriporiopsis gilvescens (Bres.) Domański, a white rot polypore, also sometimes
resembles C. pseudoplacenta, but its salmon-pinkish colours are usually#Misc-exposition*]

Y.C. Dai & Niemelä, widely distributed in Asia (Dai & Niemelä 1997; Dai 2012),
is macroscopically similar to C. pseudoplacenta, but diﬀers in its dimitic hyphal
structure and oblong-ellipsoid spores (3.7–5 × 2.1–2.9 µm).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The taxonomic position of C. pseudoplacenta is a mystery, as the sequence
analysis (see below) revealed very low homology with known fungi. So we chose
for it the congregate genus Ceriporiopsis Domański that encompasses white rot
species that are poroid, resupinate, and monomitic with clamp connections.
Sequence analysis — Successful ampliﬁcation and sequencing of the
C. pseudoplacenta ITS (nrDNA) region from four of six collected specimens
showed only minor diﬀerences between individual specimens (Plate 9).
5.8S rDNA is highly homologous with many other polypores, but for the
very long ITS1 region (280-283b) the GenBank MegaBlast search found
“no signiﬁcant similarity,” which we never experienced before for polypore
species. ITS2 analyses indicate very low similarity with seemingly distant
fungi, with Ceriporiopsis species showing the closest support among the
polypores. Sequence analyses weakly support clustering of C. gilvescens with
C. pseudoplacenta, and apart from the brown-rot fungi Postia Fr., Auriporia
Ryvarden and Antrodia P. Karst. in a separate clade (Plate 9). Some Phlebia
Fr. species, macroscopically similar except for the hymenophore form, cluster
even more closely with C. pseudoplacenta, as also shown in the nrDNA LSU
sequence analyses (Plate 10). For the time being, the generic position of the
new species must be regarded as provisional.#Misc-exposition*]

the occurrence of the similar Skeletocutis odora in the USA warrants mention.
Lowe (1966) stated that S. odora is known with certainty only from Peck’s
type and one other report from Pennsylvania, while Gilbertson & Ryvarden
(1987) do not cite the species at all from the USA. We also never found S. odora
during numerous excursions in either the east or west USA, although it is not
uncommon in old-growth conifer forests in Europe.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequence analysis — The ampliﬁed ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence from Skeletocutis
subodora (603b long between ITS1 and ITS4 primers) was somewhat similar
(variations of 3.0% (6/195) for ITS1 and 4% (8/205) for ITS2) to that of S. odora
(Plate 13), suggesting that the two species are related to but diﬀerent from
each other. Surprisingly, Tyromyces chioneus (Fr.) P. Karst., with a still unsettled
taxonomic position, shows surprisingly more homology than other Skeletocutis
species.#Misc-exposition*]
