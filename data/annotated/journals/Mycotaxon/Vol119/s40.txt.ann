[@Abstract — Two new species, Heteroconium annesleae on decaying branches of Anneslea
hainanensis and H. neolitseae on decaying branches of Neolitsea obtusifolia, are described,
illustrated, and compared with closely related taxa. Illustrations are also provided of two
other anamorphic fungi, Xenoheteroconium bicolor and Craspedodidymum ﬁmbriatum,
which are recorded for the ﬁrst time from China.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Petrak (1949) erected Heteroconium with H. citharexyli Petr. as the type
species. The genus is distinguished by euseptate, fusiform, cylindrical to oblong
conidia that arise in acropetal unbranched chains from solitary conidiophores
with monoblastic, terminal, determinate or percurrent conidiogenous cells
(Petrak 1949, Ellis 1971, Castañeda et al. 1999, Taylor et al. 2001). Castañeda
et al. (2008) provided a key to 16 species of Heteroconium, and 19 species are
currently accepted. Few other genera produce unbranched acropetal chains
of phragmoconidia (which can almost be scolecoconidial). Lobatopedis has
branched conidiophores with lobed basal cells and rhexolytic conidial secession.
Lylea has short inconspicuous conidiophores and symmetrical cylindrical
distoseptate conidia with rounded ends and extremely thick walls. Its primary
conidia may produce lateral conidia that, as in Xenoheteroconium, can develop
from non-apical cells. Pirozynskiella has unbranched acropetal conidial chains
but is a tropical mycoparasite of Asterinaceae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Xenoheteroconium was established by Bhat et al. (Bhat & Kendrick 1993)
to accommodate X. bicolor. The genus is unique in having a bi-coloured#Misc-exposition*]

[@conidiophore, with the darker apical portion developing lateral conidia before
seceding and acting as a propagule.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Craspedodidymum Hol.-Jech. (Holubová-Jechová 1972) is typiﬁed by C. elatum
Hol.-Jech., which has branched conidiophores terminating in apically inﬂated
phialides with large funnel-shaped collarettes, producing pale brown aseptate
conidia in slimy heads.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Decaying wood in the tropical forests of Hainan Province supports a high
level of fungal diversity, and many wood-inhabiting macrofungi and microfungi
have been recently discovered there (Ma et al. 2008, Dai et al. 2009, Zhang
et al. 2009a,b, Dai & Li 2010). During continuing investigations of saprobic
microfungi, numerous conidial species were collected on decaying branches,
among which two have morphological characteristics of Heteroconium. They
diﬀer from any described species and are proposed as new to science. Two other
fungi are recorded for the ﬁrst time from China. The specimens are deposited
in HSAUP (Herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology, Shandong
Agricultural University) and HMAS (Mycological Herbarium, Institute of
Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences).#Misc-exposition*]
