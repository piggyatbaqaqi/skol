[@Abstract — Twenty-ﬁve strains of monoverticillate Penicillium species were isolated from
dissected guts and fecal pellets of leaf-eating caterpillars reared in the Área de Conservación
Guanacaste, Costa Rica, or from washed leaves of their food plants. Phylogenetic analyses
of β-tubulin, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), cytochrome c oxidase
subunit 1, translation elongation factor 1-α and calmodulin gene sequences revealed two
phylogenetically distinct, undescribed species closely related to P. sclerotiorum. Penicillium
mallochii was isolated from Rothschildia lebeau and Citheronia lobesis (Saturniidae) and
their food plant Spondias mombin (Anacardiaceae) and P. guanacastense from Eutelia sp.
(Noctuidae). Both fungi produce greenish conidial masses and orange pigments in agar culture,
have smooth-walled, monoverticillate conidiophores with moderately vesiculate apices, and
globose to subglobose conidia. The species morphologically resemble P. sclerotiorum but
diﬀer subtly in vesicle width and conidial shape.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 2001, a microbial observatory was established in Sector Santa Rosa
of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Área de Conservación Guanacaste,
northwestern Costa Rica, to culture microbiota (including fungi) associated
with caterpillars reared on the tree Spondias mombin as a model for elucidating
ecological roles of insects and associated microbes in a tropical forest ecosystem.#Misc-exposition*]

[@316 ... Rivera & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The fungi isolated from dissected caterpillar guts and fecal pellets were the
subject of an MSc thesis (Urb 2006) and included many Penicillium strains that
required detailed taxonomic study to identify. Several strains were identiﬁed
as the common and widespread biverticillate Penicillium citrinum Thom, but
a signiﬁcant number had unbranched, monoverticillate conidiophores and
colonies reminiscent of P. sclerotiorum J.F.H. Beyma (Pitt 1979).#Misc-exposition*]
[@As part of the Canadian Barcode of Life Network, we explored DNA
barcoding of Penicillium species using cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1; Seifert
et al. 2007) and the proposed fungal DNA barcode, the internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. In this paper, two new species,
P. mallochii and P. guanacastense are formally described from the Área de
Conservación Guanacaste, as part of a broader revision of the P. sclerotiorum
complex (Rivera & Seifert 2011). The fungi were characterized using cultural
and microscopic characters, DNA barcode data, and additional DNA sequence
data from β-tubulin (benA), translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1-α), and
calmodulin (cmd) genes.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Isolates#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caterpillars of Rothschildia lebeau and Citheronia lobesis (Saturniidae) feeding on
Spondias mombin (Anacardiaceae), Cochlospermum vitifolium (Bixaceae), or Exostema
mexicanum (Rubiaceae) were collected by Joel Díaz, Felipe Chavarría-Díaz, and
Maria Garcia in the tropical dry forest of Sector Santa Rosa of Área de Conservación
Guanacaste, northwestern Costa Rica. Caterpillars were surface sterilized with dH2O and
ethanol and guts were removed aseptically and, when possible, partitioned into foregut
plus midgut and hindgut sections. Gut contents or feces (obtained from caterpillars kept
in sterile Petri dishes) were suspended in sterile H2O and serially diluted in sterile dH2O,
then plated on soil extract-rose bengal agar (Bills & Foster 2004). Fungal colonies were
transferred to Malt Extract Agar (MEA, Samson et al. 2004) until pure cultures were
obtained. Cultures are preserved in the Canadian Collection of Fungal Cultures (CCFC,
Table 1) and ex-types are also deposited in the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre
culture collection (CBS), Utrecht, the Netherlands. Cultures lacking DAOM numbers
are preserved in the personal collection of K. Seifert (KAS) or R.G. Thorn (RGTHC).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Details for cultures of other species are given by Rivera & Seifert (2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@BLAST searches of ITS and benA sequences suggested that the new species were
related to Penicillium sclerotiorum. When possible, we obtained ﬁve strains per species of
this clade (Peterson 2000) for comparison, including P. sclerotiorum, P. adametzii K.M.
Zalessky, P. bilaiae Chalab., P. herquei Bainier & Sartory and P. hirayamae Udagawa.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Strains were obtained from CBS and the USDA-ARS, National Center for Agricultural
Utilization Research culture collection (NRRL).#Misc-exposition*]

[@For standardized descriptions, spore suspensions in 0.1% semi-solid agar were
inoculated at three points on Czapek Yeast Agar (CYA, Pitt 1979) with added micro-#Misc-exposition*]

[@nutrients (Samson et al. 2004), and MEA in 9 cm polystyrene Petri dishes, and incubated
at 25 °C for 7 d in the dark (Samson & Pitt 1985). To determine whether sclerotia could
be induced, some strains were incubated for up to 6 months in incident light at room
temperature on Oatmeal Agar (OA, Samson et al. 2004). Colony colors were determined
using Kornerup & Wanscher (1978); alphanumeric color codes refer to this work.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Colony photographs were taken with a Nikon CoolPix E 5000 camera with incandescent
lighting and a copy stand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Microscopic examinations employed an Olympus BX 50 light microscope on material
removed from MEA colonies and mounted in 85% lactic acid. Microphotographs were
taken with an Evolution MP Camera and microscopic characters were measured from
digital images using Image-Pro Plus v. 6 (Media Cybernetics, MD, U.S.A.). For each
strain, ten phialides, stipes, metulae and vesicles were measured manually, and 25
automated measurements were made for conidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA isolation, PCR ampliﬁcation, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@Detailed protocols are provided in the revision of the P. sclerotiorum complex by
Rivera & Seifert (2011), along with details of PCR and sequencing of some strains, and
only a summary of relevant details is provided here. DNA was extracted from agar
cultures using UltraCleanTM Microbial DNA Isolation Kits (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc.,
Montreal, Canada) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Genes were ampliﬁed by PCR
and sequenced with the following primers: benA Bt2a and Bt2b (Glass & Donaldson
1995); ITS ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990); cox1 PF and AR (Seifert et al. 2007); tef1-α
EF1c and EF6 (Peterson et al. 2004); cmd CMD5 and CMD6 (Hong et al. 2006).#Misc-exposition*]
[@PCR reactions were performed in 10 µl reaction mixtures with 1 µl genomic DNA,
1X PCR Buﬀer, 0.1 mm of dNTPs, 0.08 µM of each primer, and 0.5X Taq polymerase, in
a TGradient (Biometra, Montreal, Canada) or a Genius (Techne, Duxford, Cambridge)
thermocycler. Sequencing reactions were performed directly from PCR products in both
directions, with templates precipitated by ethanol/EDTA/sodium acetate precipitation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequences were determined on an ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California, USA).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Consensus sequences were assembled using Sequencher v. 4.8 (Genes Codes
Corporation, MI, USA). Alignments were constructed using the online version of
MAFFT v. 6 (Katoh et al. 2009), and adjusted to optimize homology using BioEdit
7.0.9 (Hall 1999). Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses were performed using heuristic
searches in PAUP v. 4 (Swoﬀord 2002) with the tree bisection-reconnection (TBR)
branchswapping algorithm. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were performed
using Phylogenies for Maximum Likelihood (PhyML) v. 2.4.4 (Guindon et al. 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Tree searches for each alignment were run under the nucleotide substitution model
obtained from ModelTest 3.7, using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) (Posada
and Crandall, 1998), and starting from a tree obtained for branch swapping using the
modiﬁed neighbor joining algorithm BIONJ (Gascuel 1997) as implemented by PhyML.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Bayesian inference (BI) analyses were performed using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Huelsenbeck and
Ronquist 2001), under the same models selected for ML. All Bayesian analyses were
performed using random starting trees, and for each gene, four chains were run for one
million generations, sampling every 100 generations, generating 10,001 trees, with the
ﬁrst 2,500 discarded as ‘burnin’ for each chain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both P. mallochii and P. guanacastense received strong support as distinct
monophyletic clades in all analyses of all ﬁve genes (Table 2). The MP benA
trees revealed two groups of strains within P. mallochii 86% and 70% bootstrap

0.814 ML probabilities, and BI posterior probabilities of 0.74 and 0.66. Long
branch lengths subtending these two clades on the MP tree appear to be an
artifact, sometimes experienced with maximum parsimony analyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Penicillium mallochii and P. guanacastense are phylogenetically related and
morphologically very similar to P. sclerotiorum. All three species have vesiculate,
monoverticillate conidiophores and vivid orange to red colony reverses
on CYA. Morphological characters place both species in Penicillium subg.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Aspergilloides ser. Glabra (Pitt 1979), and the recently erected, phylogenetically
and morphologically deﬁned sect. Sclerotiora (Houbraken & Samson 2011). All
species in this series have long, monoverticillate conidiophores with a swollen
or vesiculate apex. The conidiophores of P. sclerotiorum sensu stricto are
conspicuously vesiculate (mean 3.6 ± 0.4 µm), while those of P. mallochii and
P. guanacastense are only moderately vesiculate, but with the vesicles of
P. mallochii (3.1 ± 0.2 µm) being slightly more swollen than those of
P. guanacastense (3.0 ± 0.3 µm). Furthermore, P. sclerotiorum has ellipsoidal
conidia, while P. mallochii and P. guanacastense have globose to subglobose
conidia. Some strains of P. sclerotiorum produce pale colored sclerotia (Pitt
1979), which were not observed in any of our P. mallochii and P. guanacastense
strains.#Misc-exposition*]
[@There are ecological diﬀerences among these three species. Penicillium
mallochii strains were isolated from saturniid caterpillars and leaves of their food
plant Spondias mombin, whereas P. guanacastense was isolated from noctuid
caterpillars, also feeding on Spondias mombin. In contrast, P. sclerotiorum
strains have mostly been isolated from the soil and the air.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Penicillium mallochii & P. guanacastense spp. nov. (Costa Rica) ... 327#Misc-exposition*]

[@Based on our ﬁve-gene analysis of multiple strains of each species, P. mallochii,
P. guanacastense, and P. sclerotiorum are phylogenetically distinct species. Each
species was resolved as a strongly supported monophyletic group with each
gene, with each kind of analysis, except for the ITS MP and BI analyses, which
did not resolve P. mallochii from the branch that grouped P. guanacastense and
P. sclerotiorum.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the study of microfungi isolated from guts and frass of two species of
caterpillars feeding on the tree Spondias mombin, Penicillium was the fourth
most commonly isolated of the 48 identiﬁed genera, comprising 88 of 835
isolates (Urb 2006). Twenty-four strains of P. citrinum were isolated, and
this was the most frequent species isolated from guts of Citheronia lobesis
(with three β-tubulin variants, represented by GenBank accession numbers
JN637993–JN637995). A similar number of strains of P. mallochii were isolated
from Rothschildia lebeau (Urb 2006). Whether these species are phylloplane
inhabitants or endophytes of S. mombin leaves is unknown, and the signiﬁcance
of their frequent association with these caterpillars remains a subject for future
research.#Misc-exposition*]
