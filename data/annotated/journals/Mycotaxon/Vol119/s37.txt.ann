[@Abstract — The aim of this study was to clarify the identity of several collections of
Gloeocystidiellum from Azores Archipelago and Madeira Island that were initially related to
the Gloeocystidiellum porosum–clavuligerum group. Three new ITS nrDNA sequences were
aligned and analysed phylogenetically with 18 homologous sequences from GenBank. The
two main lineages, with very high bootstrap value, that were detected correspond to two wellseparated species, G. kenyense and G. clavuligerum. The sequences obtained from Azores and
Madeira specimens clustered in the G. kenyense clade. Gloeocystidiellum kenyense is described
and illustrated from the specimens collected in Macaronesian region, and its aﬃnities with
G. clavuligerum are discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the framework of our studies about corticioid fungi from oceanic islands
(Dueñas et al. 2008a, b, Melo et al. 2008, Telleria et al. 2008, 2009a, b, c), we
found several collections of a Gloeocystidiellum species. These collections from
Azores Archipelago and Madeira Island are related, according to Larsson &
Hallenberg (2001), to the Gloeocystidiellum porosum–clavuligerum group.
Donk (1931) described Gloeocystidiellum (Russulales, Gloeocystidiellaceae),
selecting G. porosum (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Donk as type, to accommodate the
corticioid fungi with monomitic hyphal system, gloeocystidia, and smooth or
ornamented amyloid spores. Larsson & Larsson (2003) accept Gloeocystidiellum#Misc-exposition*]

[@338 ... Telleria & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@in a strict sense to include a few species with resupinate basidiomes with
smooth hymenophores, monomitic hyphal systems, hyphae with clamps, SA+
or SA– gloeocystidia, and ellipsoid, ornamented and amyloid spores.
Several morphological and molecular studies as well as cultural studies
and intercompatibility tests have analyzed species delimitation in the
Gloeocystidiellum porosum–clavuligerum group (Nakasone 1982, Hallenberg
1984, 1988, Boidin et al. 1997, Larsson & Hallenberg 2001, Larsson & Larsson
2002, 2003). ITS2 and LSU nrDNA phylogenetic analyses were congruent with
intercompatibility tests and gave higher resolution in diﬀerentiating this species
complex than could be found in morphologically based analyses. Larsson &
Larsson (2002) and Larsson & Hallenberg (2001) found that G. porosum and
G. clavuligerum (Höhn. & Litsch.) Nakasone are phylogenetically widely separated
and that G. clavuligerum should be divided into two taxa, G. clavuligerum and
G. kenyense.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Our goal was to clarify the identity of Gloeocystidiellum specimens from
Azores and Madeira mentioned above. ITS nrDNA sequences from three
collections were compared with homologous sequences from GenBank
published in Larsson & Hallenberg (2001) and Larsson & Larsson (2003). As
mentioned in Seifert (2009), the ITS region has became the default marker for
species identiﬁcation in fungi. Morphological characters were compared with
the taxa described in Larsson & Larsson (2002).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphological studies#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colors of basidioma are according to ISCC_NBS Centroid Color Charts. Dried
specimens were used for light microscope study. Measurements and drawing were
made from microscopic sections mounted in 3% KOH solution or Melzer’s reagent and
examined at up to 1250× with an Olympus BX51 microscope provided with a drawing
tube. Lengths and widths of 30 spores, 10 basidia, and 10 cystidia were measured from
each sample. Voucher specimens have been deposited in TFC, MA, LISU, O.
DNA extractions and sequencing#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genomic DNA was isolated from herbarium specimens using an EZNA Fungal
DNA MiniPrep kit (Omega Biotek, Doraville, Georgia, USA) or a DNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following instructions of the manufacturers. Lysis
buﬀer incubation was done overnight at 55°C. The primer pair ITS1F and ITS4 was
used to obtain ampliﬁcations of both ITS regions, including the 5.8S of the ribosomal
RNA gene cluster and small ﬂanking parts of the SSU and LSU genes (White et al.
1990, Gardes & Bruns 1993). Ampliﬁcations were done using illustra™ PuReTaq™
Ready-To-Go™ PCR beads (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) as described in
Winka et al. (1998) following thermal cycling conditions in Martín & Winka (2000).
Negative controls lacking fungal DNA were run for each experiment to check for
contamination of reagents. Results of ampliﬁcations were assayed from 5 µl aliquots#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gloeocystidiellum kenyense ... 339#Misc-exposition*]

[@by gel electrophoresis of 2% Pronadisa D-1 Agarose (Lab. Conda, Spain). When the
primer pair ITS1F/ITS4 failed, the ITS regions were ampliﬁed in two parts as mentioned
in Telleria et al. (2010). Prior to sequencing the ampliﬁcation products were cleaned
using a QIAquick gel PCR puriﬁcation kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA). Both
strands were sequenced separately using primers mentioned above at Secugen S.L.
(Madrid, Spain). When products were faintly visualized on agarose gels (less that 20 ng/
µl), cloning was conducted with pGEM®-T Easy Vector System II cloning kit (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin, USA). From each cloning reaction, three clones were selected for
sequencing, using vector speciﬁc primers T7 and SP6 at Macrogen (Korea). Sequences
were edited and assembled using SequencherTM version 4.2 (Gene Codes Corporations,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA). Blastn searches with megablast option were used
to compare the sequences obtained against the sequences in the National Center of
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database. The consensus sequences have
been lodged in the EMBL-EBI database.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequences were manually aligned using Se-Al v2.0a11 Carbon (Rambaut 2002) for
multiple sequences and compared with homologous sequences of Gloeocystidiellum spp.
retrieved from the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Databases. The alignment was analyzed
using the program PAUP*Version 4.0b10 for Macintosh (Swoﬀord 2003). The maximum
parsimony analysis (MP) was inferred using the heuristic search option in PAUP. Gaps
were treated as missing data. Branch lengths equal to zero were collapsed to polytomies.
Nonparametric bootstrap (BP) support (Felsenstein 1985) for each clade was tested
based on 10,000 replicates, using the fast-step option.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results & discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@From direct PCR with pair primer ITS1F/ITS4, only collections TFC 15278
(GenBank FR878082), TFC 15309 (GenBank FR878083) and MA-Fungi 80408
(GenBank FR878084) were ampliﬁed and sequenced directly.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The new sequences included the last 5 bp of 18S nrDNA, the complete
ITS1—5.8S—ITS2 sequence, and the ﬁrst 46 or 50 bp of the 28S nrDNA.
The blast search of the three new direct sequences showed an e-value
of 0.0 and a maximum similarity of 99.0% with G. clavuligerum sequences
(AF310080, AF310077, AF310079, AF310084, AF310082; AF310083) and
G. purpureum Sheng H. Wu (AF441338). Those GenBank sequences lacked the
ITS1 region and the ﬁrst part of 5.8S nrDNA, thus restricting the Blast search
to the last 369 bp at the 3ʹ end.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The other G. clavuligerum sequences from Larsson & Hallenberg (2001) and
Larsson & Larsson (2003) as well as the two outgroup G. porosum sequences
(AF310101 and AF31009) were included in full length in the alignment,
which contained 21 sequences and 388 positions, of which 293 were constant,
13 parsimony-uninformative, and 82 parsimony-informative. The 100 most
parsimonious trees were obtained using the heuristic search option (tree length
= 114; CI = 0.9211; HI = 0.0789, RI = 0.9726). The bootstrap 50% majority-rule
consensus tree is shown in Fig. 1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Using G. porosum as outgroup, two main clades were detected, both with
very high bootstrap values (100%). According to Larsson & Hallenberg
(2001) and Larsson & Larsson (2002, 2003), the clades correspond with two
well-distinguished species, G. kenyense and G. clavuligerum. As shown in
Fig. 1, the three Azores and Madeira sequences cluster in the G. kenyense clade.

North America, Africa, and Taiwan on decaying angiosperm wood (Larsson

dominates most of the low altitude forests of the Azores archipelago. On
Madeira Island the species was found on Ocotea foetens, an indigenous species
characteristic of the laurisilva, the Macaronesian subtropical mountain moist
forest known from Madeira and Canary Islands.#Misc-exposition*]
