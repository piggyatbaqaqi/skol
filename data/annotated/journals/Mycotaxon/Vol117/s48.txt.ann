[@Abstract — Changes to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature are
decided on every six years at Nomenclature Sections associated with International Botanical
Congresses (IBC). The XVIII IBC was held in Melbourne, Australia; the Nomenclature Section
met from 18-22 July 2011 and its decisions were accepted by the Congress at its plenary session
on 30 July. Several important changes were made to the Code as a result of this meeting
that will aﬀect publication of new names. Two of these changes will come into eﬀect on
1 January 2012, some months before the Melbourne Code is published. Electronic material
published online in Portable Document Format (PDF) with an International Standard Serial
Number (ISSN) or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) will constitute eﬀective
publication, and the requirement for a Latin description or diagnosis for names of new taxa
will be changed to a requirement for a description or diagnosis in either Latin or English. In
addition, eﬀective from 1 January 2013, new names of organisms treated as fungi must, in
order to be validly published, include in the protologue (everything associated with a name
at its valid publication) the citation of an identiﬁer issued by a recognized repository (such
as MycoBank). Draft text of the new articles dealing with electronic publication is provided
and best practice is outlined.#Misc-exposition*]

Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, this article will be published in Botanical

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the XVIII International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia,
in July 2011, two important changes were made to the International#Misc-exposition*]

[@510 ... Knapp, McNeill & Turland#Page-header*]
[@Code of Botanical Nomenclature (now the International Code of
Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants) that will take eﬀect from
1 January 2012. These changes will aﬀect everyone who publishes names
governed by this Code. As the Melbourne Code will not be published until
approximately mid-2012, we felt it would be helpful to outline these changes,
particularly those concerning eﬀective publication in electronic media (in
Articles 29, 30, and 31). For a concise report on all the changes to the Code
accepted in Melbourne, see McNeill & al. (2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@A draft wording of the revised Articles, Notes, and Recommendations on
eﬀective publication is provided to aid editors and publishers in establishing
best practice for implementing this aspect of the Code. We also outline here
what these changes do not mean, in order to guide those wishing to publish
new names and typiﬁcations by electronic means. We urge readers to consult
the report of the Special Committee on Electronic Publication accompanying
the changes proposed prior to the Congress (Chapman & al. 2010), wherein the
reasoning for the changes now accepted into the Code is set out.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Draft wording of revised Articles 29, 30, and 31 and
Recommendations 29A, 30A, and 31A#Misc-exposition*]

[@Here we reproduce the wording of all of the relevant Articles, Notes, and
Recommendations (omitting the Examples), with the changes highlighted in
bold. The wording here is provisional, pending the meeting of the Editorial
Committee in December 2011 to ﬁnalize the printed version of the Melbourne
Code.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Article 29#Misc-exposition*]

[@29.1. Publication is eﬀected, under this Code, by distribution of printed matter
(through sale, exchange or gift) to the general public or at least to botanical institutions
with libraries accessible to botanists generally. Publication is also eﬀected by electronic
distribution of material in Portable Document Format (PDF; see also Art. 29.3
and Rec. 29A.1) in an online publication with an International Standard Serial
Number (ISSN) or an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). Publication is
not eﬀected by communication of new names at a public meeting, by the placing of
names in collections or gardens open to the public, by the issue of microﬁlm made from
manuscripts, typescripts or other unpublished material, or by distribution electronically
other than as described above.#Misc-exposition*]
[@29.2. For the purpose of this Article, “online” is deﬁned as accessible electronically
via the World Wide Web.#Misc-exposition*]
[@29.3. Should Portable Document Format (PDF) be succeeded, a successor
international standard format communicated by the General Committee (see Div.
III) is acceptable.#Misc-exposition*]
[@29.4. The content of a particular electronic publication must not be altered after it is
ﬁrst issued. Any such alterations are not themselves eﬀectively published. Corrections
or revisions must be issued separately to be eﬀectively published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Melbourne Code and e-publication ... 511#Page-header*]
[@Recommendation 29A#Misc-exposition*]
[@[Existing Recommendation replaced by the following]#Misc-exposition*]

[@29A.1. Publication electronically in Portable Document Format (PDF) should
comply with the PDF/A archival standard (ISO 19005).#Misc-exposition*]
[@29A.2. Authors should preferably publish in publications that are archived,
satisfying the following criteria as far as is practical (see also Rec. 29A.1):
(a) The material should be placed in multiple trusted online digital repositories,
e.g. an ISO-certiﬁed repository;
(b) Digital repositories should be in more than one area of the world and preferably
on diﬀerent continents;
(c) Deposition of printed copies in libraries in more than one area of the world and
preferably on diﬀerent continents is also advisable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Article 30#Misc-exposition*]

[@30.1. Publication by distribution of electronic material does not constitute eﬀective
publication before 1 January 2012.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.2. An electronic publication is not eﬀectively published if there is evidence
associated with or within the publication that it is merely a preliminary version that
was, or is to be, replaced by a version that the publisher considers ﬁnal, in which case
only that ﬁnal version is eﬀectively published.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.3. Publication by indelible autograph before 1 January 1953 is eﬀective. Indelible
autograph produced at a later date is not eﬀectively published.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.4. For the purpose of this Article, indelible autograph is handwritten material
reproduced by some mechanical or graphic process (such as lithography, oﬀset, or
metallic etching).#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.5. Publication on or after 1 January 1953 in trade catalogues or non-scientiﬁc
newspapers, and on or after 1 January 1973 in seed-exchange lists, does not constitute
eﬀective publication.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.6. The distribution on or after 1 January 1953 of printed matter accompanying
exsiccatae does not constitute eﬀective publication.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Note 1. If the printed matter is also distributed independently of the exsiccata, it is
eﬀectively published.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30.7. Publication on or after 1 January 1953 of an independent non-serial work stated
to be a thesis submitted to a university or other institute of education for the purpose
of obtaining a degree is not eﬀectively published unless it includes an explicit statement
(referring to the requirements of the Code for eﬀective publication) or other internal
evidence that it is regarded as an eﬀective publication by its author or publisher.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Note 2. The presence of an International Standard Book Number (ISBN) or a
statement of the name of the printer, publisher, or distributor in the original printed
version is regarded as internal evidence that the work was intended to be eﬀectively
published.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recommendation 30A#Misc-exposition*]

[@30A.1. Preliminary and ﬁnal versions of the same electronic publication should be
clearly indicated as such when they are ﬁrst issued.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30A.2. It is strongly recommended that authors avoid publishing new names and
descriptions or diagnoses of new taxa (nomenclatural novelties) in ephemeral printed#Misc-exposition*]

[@512 ... Knapp, McNeill & Turland#Page-header*]
[@matter of any kind, in particular printed matter that is multiplied in restricted and
uncertain numbers, in which the permanence of the text may be limited, for which
eﬀective publication in terms of number of copies is not obvious, or that is unlikely
to reach the general public. Authors should also avoid publishing new names and
descriptions or diagnoses in popular periodicals, in abstracting journals, or on
correction slips.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30A.3. To aid availability through time and place, authors publishing nomenclatural
novelties should give preference to periodicals that regularly publish taxonomic articles.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Otherwise, a copy of a publication (whether published as printed or electronic
matter) should be sent to an indexing centre appropriate to the taxonomic group, and
publications that exist only as printed matter should be deposited in at least ten, but
preferably more, botanical or other generally accessible libraries throughout the world.#Misc-exposition*]
[@30A.4. Authors and editors are encouraged to mention nomenclatural novelties in
the summary or abstract, or list them in an index in the publication.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Article 31#Misc-exposition*]

[@31.1. The date of eﬀective publication is the date on which the printed or electronic
matter became available as deﬁned in Art. 29 and 30. In the absence of proof establishing
some other date, the one appearing in the printed or electronic matter must be accepted
as correct.#Misc-exposition*]
[@[Existing Note 1 replaced by the following]#Misc-exposition*]
[@31.2. When a publication is issued in parallel electronic and printed versions,
these must be treated as eﬀectively published on the same date unless the dates of the
versions are diﬀerent according to Art. 31.1.#Misc-exposition*]
[@31.3. When separates from periodicals or other works placed on sale are issued in
advance, the date on the separate is accepted as the date of eﬀective publication unless
there is evidence that it is erroneous.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recommendation 31A#Misc-exposition*]

[@31A.1. The date on which the publisher or publisher’s agent delivers printed matter
to one of the usual carriers for distribution to the public should be accepted as its date
of eﬀective publication.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Best practice#Misc-exposition*]

[@Authors of new names, editors and publishers will all be interested in
ensuring that the publications including new names are in accordance with
the Melbourne Code, so that the names therein are eﬀectively published. We
suggest that those publishing in journals or monograph series and books that
have online editions communicate with the editors so that best practice can
be established across the community as quickly as possible. Many publishers
have been carefully addressing the issues involved with the e-publication of
novelties for some time (see Knapp & Wright 2010; guidelines in PLoS ONE,
http://www.plosone.org/static/policies.action#taxon) and considerable interest
in making these new Code changes function eﬀectively has been apparent.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Some practices that we feel will help with the initial stages of e-publication
of novelties that are according to the Melbourne Code are:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Melbourne Code and e-publication ... 513#Page-header*]

[@• Having each article bear the date of publication prominently (as is done
in many journals, for example New Phytologist or Nature).#Misc-exposition*]
[@• If an online early version is issued that is not the same as the ﬁnal
version (and thus not the place of eﬀective publication) stamp each
article with this fact prominently (for example American Journal
of Botany).#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Prominent display of the ISSN or ISBN of the publication on each
article will help indexers establish eﬀective publication.#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Publication in journals (or monograph series) that participate in the
CLOCKSS system (see Knapp & Wright, 2010, for a description) or
another international archive and preservation system will ensure
long-term archiving.#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Authors of new names by electronic means should alert the appropriate
indexing center as recommended in Rec. 30.A.3 – this will help
indexers who may otherwise not be aware of electronically published
names.#Misc-exposition*]
[@What these changes do not mean#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the new Articles and Recommendations use the terms PDF
and PDF/A, this does not mean that publications must be issued only in that
format to be eﬀectively published. For example, some online journals issue
papers in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format together with a parallel
PDF version. In such cases, the PDF version will be eﬀectively published.
The stipulation that the General Committee for Botanical Nomenclature will
communicate the acceptability of a new international standard format, should
PDF ever be succeeded, means authors of novelties and the community using
the Code can remain informed as to advances in the ﬁeld and that the Code
will be protected from obsolescence.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Use of the following means of electronic publication will not result in
eﬀective publication of novelties under the Melbourne Code.#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Publication on websites or in ephemeral documents available over the
Internet (there are strict criteria for granting of ISSNs — see http://
www.issn.org/).#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Publication in journals without a registered ISSN or e-ISSN.#Misc-exposition*]
[@• Publication in books without a registered ISBN or e-ISBN.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The Recommendation approved to advise the deposition of a hard copy of any
e-publication in a library suggests to botanists an action, but it does not set out
standard practice or a protocol for librarians to follow. Librarians are themselves
in a complex transition zone between publication modalities (Johnson & Luther#Misc-exposition*]

[@514 ... Knapp, McNeill & Turland#Page-header*]
[@2007), and botanists may ﬁnd them unwilling or unable to accommodate single
hard copy papers as individual accessions should the volume be great.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Two other important changes to the Code relating to
the publication of names#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second change to the Code approved in Melbourne to take eﬀect from 1
January 2012 is that the description or diagnosis required for valid publication
of the name of a new taxon of all organisms falling under the Code may be in
either English or Latin. This is the current provision for names of plant fossils,
but all new non-fossil taxa have required a Latin description or diagnosis (fungi
and plants from 1 January 1935; algae [including cyanobacteria, if treated
under the Code] from 1 January 1958). This has no bearing on the form of
scientiﬁc names, which continue to be Latin or treated as Latin. Individual
journal requirements for Latin and/or English will, of course, be determined by
the editors of those journals.#Misc-exposition*]
[@A third change to the Code approved in Melbourne relating to publication
of names, but one not taking eﬀect until 1 January 2013 (not 1 January 2012 as
reported by Miller & al., 2011), is that all new names of organisms treated as
fungi must, as an additional requirement for valid publication, include in the
protologue the citation of an identiﬁer issued by a recognized repository (such
as MycoBank, http://www.mycobank.org/). This will be publicized separately.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The requirement for a unique identiﬁer for new names of fungi on or after 1
January 2013 does not apply to plants or algae; there is no need for authors of
new names in these groups to request LSIDs (Life Science Identiﬁers) – or other
identiﬁers – from indexing centers.#Misc-exposition*]
