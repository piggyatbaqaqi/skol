[@Abstract —Mangifera indica, a disease known as mango blight, murcha or seca da
mangueira in Brazil, is caused by the canker wilt pathogen Ceratocystis ﬁmbriata sensu
lato. It is also closely associated with infestation by the non-native wood-boring beetle
Hypocryphalus mangiferae (Coleoptera: Scolytinae). The aim of this study was to characterize
Ceratocystis isolates obtained from diseased mango trees in Brazil. Identiﬁcation was based
on sequence data from ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 rDNA, part of the Beta-tubulin 1 gene, and part of
the Transcription Elongation Factor 1-alpha gene. The Brazilian isolates grouped in two well
deﬁned and unique clades within C. ﬁmbriata s.l. These were also distinct from C. manginecans,
which causes a similar disease associated with H. mangiferae in Oman and Pakistan. Based
on sequence comparisons and morphological characteristics, isolates representing the two
phylogenetic clades are described as C. mangicola sp. nov. and C. mangivora sp. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@A disease typiﬁed by wilting of the leaves, ﬂowers, and stems of mango trees
(Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae) mango) was ﬁrst reported from Brazil in
the 1930’s (Viégas 1960, Ploetz 2003). The disease, commonly referred to as
“mango blight”, “seca” or “murcha da mangueira”, represents one of the most
important constraints to mango production in Brazil (Ploetz 2003). The causal
agent of this disease was identiﬁed as Ceratocystis ﬁmbriata Ellis & Halst. sensu
lato (s.l.) (Viégas 1960, Piza 1966, Ribeiro 1980).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ceratocystis ﬁmbriata s.l. was ﬁrst recognized as possibly encompassing more
than one taxon by Webster & Butler (1967a, b), who showed host speciﬁcity#Misc-exposition*]

[@382 ... Van Wyk & al.#Page-header*]
[@amongst isolates of the fungus. Isolates of C. ﬁmbriata s.l. are morphologically
similar, but many can be diﬀerentiated through DNA sequence analyses. During
the past decade, numerous new and cryptic species in the C. ﬁmbriata complex
have been described. Examples include the African fungus C. albifundus M.J.
Wingf. et al. (Wingﬁeld et al. 1996, Barnes et al. 2005), C. larium M. van Wyk
& M.J. Wingf. (Van Wyk et al. 2009a), C. cacaofunesta Engelbr. & T.C. Harr.
(Engelbrecht & Harrington 2005), C. ﬁmbriatomima M. van Wyk & M.J. Wingf.
(Van Wyk et al. 2009b), C. curvata M. van Wyk & M.J. Wingf., C. ecuadoriana
M. van Wyk & M.J. Wingf., and C. diversiconidia M. van Wyk & M.J. Wingf. (Van
Wyk et al. 2011). In the strict sense, C. ﬁmbriata is restricted to those isolates
related to the sweet potato black-rot pathogen, ﬁrst described by Halsted (1890)
from diseased Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. (Convolvulaceae) (sweet potato)
tubers in the USA (Engelbrecht & Harrington 2005). An alternative view is
that phylogenetically diﬀerent C. ﬁmbriata s.l. isolates from various Brazilian
hosts might represent populations of C. ﬁmbriata s.s. rather than discrete taxa
(Ferreira et al. 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ceratocystis species require wounds to infect trees (De Vay et al. 1963, Kile
1993). In Brazil, mango blight is closely associated with the wood-boring beetle
Hypocryphalus mangiferae Stebbing (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) that is native to
southern Asia (Wood 1982, Butani 1993, Atkinson & Peck 1994). It has been
hypothesized that this insect aids in the dissemination of the fungus in Brazil
(Ribeiro 1980, Yamashiro & Myazaki 1985, Ploetz 2003). Interestingly, the
same beetle is associated with Ceratocystis manginecans M. van Wyk et al. that
causes a serious disease of Mango trees in Oman and Pakistan (Al Adawi et al.
2006, Van Wyk et al. 2005; 2007a) and that has the same symptoms as mango
blight in Brazil.#Misc-exposition*]
[@When Van Wyk et al. (2007a) described C. manginecans, only two
C. ﬁmbriata s.l. isolates from diseased mango in Brazil were included. These
isolates diﬀered phylogenetically from C. manginecans but were not treated as
novel due to the small number of isolates available. Recently, a larger collection
of C. ﬁmbriata s.l. isolates associated with mango blight in Brazil has become
available for study. The aim of this investigation was to compare these isolates
with C. manginecans and thus to determine their identity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA was extracted from the isolates obtained from mango in Brazil according to
Van Wyk et al. (2006). Three sets of analyses were run on DNA sequence data obtained
from these isolates. The ﬁrst dataset comprising the Internal Transcribed Spacer region
1 and 2 including the 5.8S rRNA operon (ITS) included sequences for all species in the
C. ﬁmbriata s.l. complex as well as most C. ﬁmbriata sequences available in GenBank
(http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and from a variety of plants in Brazil. For the second dataset,
three gene regions were targeted for PCR including the ITS, part of the Beta-tubulin 1
(βt) gene, and part of the Transcription Elongation Factor 1-alpha gene (EF1-α). Data
for these three gene regions were combined. The third dataset consisted of only the
isolates from Brazil and from mango with each gene region (ITS, βt, EF1-α) treated
separately.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA ampliﬁcation was achieved with the primer sets ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al.
1990), βt1a and βt1b (Glass & Donaldson 1995), and EF1F and EF1R (Jacobs et al. 2004),
following the protocols described by Van Wyk et al. (2006). Ampliﬁcation was assessed
with the aid of gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide. PCR amplicons
were puriﬁed using 6% Sephadex G-50 columns (Steinheim, Germany) and sequenced
in both directions using the ABI PRISM™ Big DYE Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready
Reaction Kit (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California), with the same primers as
those used for DNA ampliﬁcation. Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI PRISM™
3100 Autosequencer (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, California, USA).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequences were analysed using the software programme Chromas Lite 2.01
(http://www.technelysium.com.au). Sequence data obtained in this study for Brazilian
isolates from mango were compared with those residing in the C. ﬁmbriata s.l. clade
for Ceratocystis obtained from GenBank or those previously published (Van Wyk
et al. 2005, 2007a,b, 2009a,b, 2011). These sequences were aligned using MAFFT
(http://timpani.genome.ad.jp/%7emafft/server/) (Katoh et al. 2002) and conﬁrmed
manually. Thereafter, the C. ﬁmbriata s.l. dataset was analyzed using PAUP version
4.0b10* (Swoﬀord 2002). Sequences for the three gene regions were analyzed separately
and a partition homogeneity test (Swoﬀord 2002) was used to determine whether the#Misc-exposition*]

[@three datasets (ITS, βt and EF1-α) could be combined. The combined analyses were
run as described in Van Wyk et al. (2009b). Sequences derived from this study were
deposited in GenBank (Table 1) and the accompanying datasets and trees are deposited
in TreeBase (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11630).#Misc-exposition*]
[@A modeltest (MrModeltest2) was run on each gene region to determine nucleotide
substitution rates (Nylander 2004) for incorporation into Bayesian analyses (MrBayes
version 3.1.1) to determine whether nodes obtained with PAUP had statistical support
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). One million trees were generated using the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure. Four chains, two hot and two cold, were
utilized to obtain the results. Trees were sampled every 100th generation and printed.
Tree likelihood scores were assessed to determine the number of trees that had formed
before stabilization to avoid including trees that had formed before convergence. Trees
outside the point of convergence were discarded by means of the burn-in procedure
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) 4 (Tamura et al. 2007) was used
to determine the level of variation between the isolates from a wide range of hosts in
Brazil for the ITS region only. In addition, this approach was applied for the ITS, βt, and
EF1-α for the isolates obtained from mango trees in Brazil and including C. manginecans
previously described from Oman and Pakistan. Sequences for each of the three gene
regions were inspected to determine the number of ﬁxed alleles between them.#Misc-exposition*]
[@An allele network was drawn using the software TCS (Clement et al. 2000). The

[@Culture characteristics and morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@Based on the phylogenetic comparisons, two groups (B1 and B2) of isolates
emerged. Three representatives from each of the two groups (CMW14797, CMW27306,
CMW28907 and CMW15052, CMW27304, CMW27305) were randomly selected for
growth studies in culture at diﬀerent temperatures. The isolates were grown for 14 days
on 2% MEA, after which 5mm diam. plugs were transferred to the centers of 90mm
Petri plates containing 2% MEA. These plates were incubated at temperatures between
5 and 35°C at ﬁve degree intervals. Five plates were used for each isolate at each of the
test temperatures and the entire experiment was repeated once. The colony colours for
isolates were assigned using the colour charts of Rayner (1970).#Misc-exposition*]
[@For microscope studies, the same six isolates, representing the two groups (B1
and B2) that were used to compare culture characteristics were selected. These
cultures were grown for 10 days on 2% MEA plates. Fungal structures were selected

relevant morphological characteristics, while 10 measurements were taken for isolates
CMW27306, CMW28907, CMW15052 and CMW27304. The averages and standard

of variation in the βt gene region. Although the P-value was low, this value
remained acceptable (Sullivan 1996, Cunningham 1997) to support combination
of the data for the three gene regions. The combined dataset for the three gene
regions consisted of a total of 1971 characters, 1066 of which were constant, 57

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results of this study showed that a relatively large collection of Ceratocystis
isolates from mango trees suﬀering from Mango blight in Brazil reside in two
distinct phylogenetic clades. These groups are, furthermore, distinct from
C. manginecans, which causes a similar disease of mango in Oman and Pakistan
(Al Adawi et al. 2006, Van Wyk et al. 2005, 2007a). The isolates residing in
these two groups are consequently treated as distinct taxa and the names
C. mangicola and C. mangivora have been provided for them.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The mango tree blight in Brazil, known for almost a century, was previously
ascribed to C. ﬁmbriata s.l., which we now recognize represents a relatively
large number of cryptic taxa. These species are morphologically very similar,
and although individual species can be distinguished from their closest
relatives, recognition based solely on morphological characteristics would#Misc-exposition*]

[@be very diﬃcult. This situation exists for many groups of fungi, for example
Fusarium species in the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (Leslie et al. 1992,
O’Donnell et al. 2000). Ceratocystis mangicola is phylogenetically most closely
related to C. manginecans, a known pathogen of mango and other crops in
Oman and Pakistan. Ceratocystis mangivora (also described in this study) has
no well-deﬁned sister group but is also closely related to the other two mango
pathogens. Isolates of these species were not only distinct from each other but
also phylogenetically distinct from the mango pathogen, C. manginecans. The
species phylogenetically most closely related to these mango pathogens from
Brazil is C. ﬁmbriatomima, which was ﬁrst isolated from Eucalyptus trees in
Venezuela (Van Wyk et al. 2009b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analyses of sequences for the ITS gene region strongly
supported separation of C. mangicola and C. mangivora. In contrast, the βt
and EF1-α gene regions for the single gene trees showed little or no variation
between C. mangicola and C. mangivora. This is not uncommon for species in
the C. ﬁmbriata complex (Van Wyk et al. 2010). Similarly the allele trees for four
species; C. ﬁmbriatomima and the three mango pathogens, C. manginecans,
C. mangicola, and C. mangivora showed that the three species from mango
were most closely related to each other. This suggests a common ancestor for
the three mango pathogens and the fact that they have probably undergone
speciation relatively recently.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ceratocystis mangicola and C. mangivora are morphologically very similar,
both producing dark brown cultures with a banana odour that is characteristic
of many species of Ceratocystis. However, isolates representing the two species
could be distinguished from each other based on various micro-morphological
characteristics. Thus, C. mangicola isolates have both divergent and convergent
ostiolar hyphae, a characteristic not noted for other C. ﬁmbriata s.l. species
except C. mangivora described here. Isolates of C. mangivora consistently
display branched ascomatal necks that give rise to either convergent or divergent
ostiolar hyphae. Furthermore, similar to some species in C. ﬁmbriata s.l.,
C. mangivora did not produce chlamydospores in culture while these structures
are very obvious in cultures of C. mangicola. Ceratocystis mangicola isolates
also have globose to sub-globose ascomatal bases compared to the globose to
obpyriform bases in C. mangivora.#Misc-exposition*]
[@A previous study on C. ﬁmbriata s.l. from diﬀerent hosts (including mango
in Brazil) treated the isolates as a genetically diverse population representing
a single taxon (Ferreira et al. 2010). It would have been interesting to include
data from that study’s isolates in our own research, which might have provided
a more robust species delimitation for C. mangicola and C. mangivora. The
unavailability of the isolates for study and the absence of their sequence data
from GenBank preclude comparisons at that level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceratocystis spp. nov. (Brazil) ... 401#Page-header*]

[@An interesting aspect of the mango blight disease in Brazil and in Oman is
the fact that the pathogens are associated with the same wood-boring insect
(H. mangiferae) in both areas of the world. Hypocryphalus mangiferae is a
monophagous bark beetle found only on Mangifera species (Schedl 1961).
Its source area is likely the same as mango trees in tropical Asia (Wood 1982,
Butani 1993, Kostermans & Bompard 1993). Both tree and beetle have been
introduced into Brazil (Wood 1982, Butani 1993, Kostermans & Bompard
1993).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Both C. mangicola and C. mangivora are suspected to be native to Brazil.
As with most Ceratocystis species, a wound is required for C. mangicola and
C. mangivora to infect mango trees (Silva et al. 1959). Intensive studies of
diseased mango trees in Brazil have shown that H. mangiferae is the only
insect present during the early disease stages. Xyleborus species (Coleoptera:
Curculionidae) typically appear when the disease spreads down towards the
larger branches and Cerambycidae only appear when the disease reaches
the trunk regions (Silva et al. 1959, Castro 1960, Medeiros & Rossetto 1966,
Rossetto et al. 1980). Studies have also shown that H. mangiferae is the primary
vector of C. mangicola and C. mangivora in Brazil (Ribeiro & Rossetto 1971).
A similar vector relationship has also been shown for C. manginecans in Oman
(Al Adawi et al. 2006, Van Wyk et al. 2007).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The fact that H. mangiferae has become associated with three cryptic species
of Ceratocystis is not surprising. Species in this group of fungi easily establish
relationships with insects (Kile 1993, Roux & Wingﬁeld 2009), probably
facilitated by the fruity aromas that they produce. The association between
C. mangicola, C. mangivora, and C. manginecans and H. mangiferae is very
similar to emerging new associations between ambrosia beetles and tree
pathogens such as those found in Laurel Wilt Disease in the USA (Mayﬁeld et
al. 2008#Misc-exposition*]
[@In this study we chose to provide names to species reﬂected by phylogenetic
lineages (C. mangicola, C. mangivora, and C. manginecans) rather than to treat
them as population components of the single species C. ﬁmbriata. In doing
so we could easily deﬁne distinctly diﬀerent phylogenetic groupings and
provide a mechanism to distinguish their diﬀerences. Deﬁned clades showing
such diﬀerences are undoubtedly valuable in studying important diseases,
including aspects of host pathogen interaction and resistance. Furthermore,
providing separate names for C. mangicola, C. mangivora, and C. manginecans
facilitates quarantine procedures and eﬀorts to curb the global movement of
tree pathogens (Wingﬁeld et al. 2001, Slippers et al. 2005).#Misc-exposition*]
