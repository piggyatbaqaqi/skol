[@Abstract — A new Macrolepiota taxon from Italy, M. rhodosperma var. velicopia, is
described and illustrated based on morphological and ITS rDNA data. It is characterized
by a well-developed volva and abundant, evident velar remnants on the pileus, a stipe with a
minutely squamulose covering, and very thick-walled elements in the pileipellis. A discussion
on its taxonomic position within Macrolepiota and notes on closely related taxa are provided.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA sequence analyses support the new taxon within the variability of M. fuliginosa sensu
Vellinga, a non-volvate taxon that diﬀers from Barla’s original sense of M. fuliginosa. As Barla
did not indicate a holotype in his protologue of Lepiota procera var. fuliginosa and there are no
extant original herbarium specimens, Barla’s Fig. 5/PL. 9 (from Les champignons des Alpes
maritimes) is selected as a lectotype, and a recent collection from Liguria (Italy) is chosen as
the epitype. A recent collection from Sardinia is chosen as epitype for L. permixta. Finally,
M. fuliginosa and M. permixta are reduced in rank to forms of M. procera, based on their
morphology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macrolepiota Singer is a genus in the Agaricaceae characterized by basidiomes
with a scaly pileus, a complex annulus, and a stipe with a smooth to granulosesquamulose covering and by spores with a distinct germ pore covered by a
hyaline cap (Singer 1986). Species with a distinct volva were accommodated
in the genus Volvolepiota Singer, proposed in 1959 to replace the illegitimate
Lepiotella Rick (Rick 1938), a later homonym of Lepiotella (E.-J. Gilbert) Konrad.#Misc-exposition*]

[@150 ... Vizzini & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The type of Volvolepiota is the Argentinean species Lepiotella brunnea Rick.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Singer (1959) added a second species, V. albida Singer. In their monograph
on Volvolepiota Heinemann & de Meijer (1996) argued that the presence of
a well developed universal veil in this taxon was not suﬃcient to warrant a
genus separate from Macrolepiota but did not propose new combinations in
Macrolepiota.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recent ITS-based molecular analyses by Vellinga (2003), Vellinga et al. (2003),
and Ge et al. (2010) place Volvolepiota species nested in the Macrolepiota clade
but in a basal position. Vellinga & Yang (2003), who considered Volvolepiota
a synonym of Macrolepiota, proposed new Macrolepiota combinations and
described M. velosa, a new volvate species from China. Ge et al. (2010) proposed
Macrolepiota sect. Volvatae Z.W. Ge et al. to accommodate the volvate species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Four Macrolepiota taxa with a volva thus far known (from Australia, East Asia
and South America; Vellinga & Yang 2003) all have a tropical distribution and
relatively small spores.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Here we discuss our research on an Italian taxon with a copious universal
veil and well-developed volva to determine its position within the genus. In
the process we also studied M. fuliginosa, M. permixta, and the complex of M.
procera (Scop.) Singer.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macromorphological features were described from fresh specimens. Colour notations
in the macroscopic descriptions are from Séguy (1936). Microscopical characters were
made from dried material rehydrated in 5% KOH and stained in Congo red, Cresyl
Blue, and Melzer’s reagent. Spore measurements are based on means of 30 spores
from two collections stained in Melzer’s reagent. Basidia were measured where widest
and from apex (sterigmata excluded) to basal septum. Author citations follow Index
Fungorum (http://www.indexfungorum.org/authorsoﬀungalnames.htm). Herbarium
abbreviations follow Thiers (2011). All examined material is housed at TO (Herbarium
generale del Dipartimento di Biologia Vegetale, Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The new Latin description is deposited in MycoBank (http://www.mycobank.org/).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The following abbreviations are used: Q = quotient of length and width of spores in
side view; Qm = average quotient; L = number of entire lamellae; l = number of lamellulae
between each pair of entire lamellae; (Se) = Séguy (1936).#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA extraction, PCR ampliﬁcation, and DNA sequencing#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 mg of herbarium specimens (Table 1) using
the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Milan Italy) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Universal primers ITS1F/ITS4 (White et al. 1990; Gardes & Bruns 1993)
were used to amplify the ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 rDNA region between the small (18S gene)
and large (28S gene) subunits. Ampliﬁcations were performed in PE9700 thermal
cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems) in a 25 µl reaction mixtures containing 5 ng#Misc-exposition*]

collection from Liguria – where the Mediterranean taxon is rather widespread
– as epitype. The basidiomata of the epitypical collection here selected are
identical, in gross characters, with those depicted by Barla (1888) and exhibit
microscopic features perfectly ﬁtting the descriptions reported by many authors
(Bellù & Lanzoni 1987, Candusso & Lanzoni 1990, Bon 1993, Migliozzi 1995)
in the region. It is also clear from Fig. 3 that the ITS sequences do not separate
this taxon from M. procera. However, morphological comparisons do support
its recognition as a form of M. procera as noted by Bellù & Lanzoni (1987),
Candusso & Lanzoni (1990), and Migliozzi (1995). Therefore we introduce the
necessary new combination.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The name Macrolepiota rhodosperma is available for M. fuliginosa sensu
Vellinga. Notes on the synonymy of the two are given by Vellinga (2001) and
Vellinga et al. (2003). A good picture is provided by Breitenbach & Kränzlin
(1995, ﬁg. 250 as M. konradii). Macrolepiota rhodosperma var. rhodosperma,
which lacks the copious velar remnants of var. velicopia, also has longer spores
and a context that changes brown-red.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Barla (1886) described Lepiota permixta as a large long-stemmed species
characterised by a pileus that is “10–15” cm wide, “brun-cannelle-fauve au
centre,” “brunâtre” towards the margin, “à écailles plus ou moins apprimées,
ﬁbrilleux, blanchâtre et plus ou moins écorché vers la marge”, lamellae that are
yellowish-white or “charné-clair”, a very slender white stipe with “petites écailles
appliquées, irrégulières, brunâtres, écorché vers la marge”, a membranous
“fauve-brunâtre” annulus, and a reddening context. He added that the described
basidiomes were collected in a submontane region and that the species was
rare. In the short notes accompanying the French description, Barla stated that
Lepiota permixta combined features from three species: the slender habit of
L. procera, the “écorché à la marge” pileus of L. excoriata, and the reddening
context of L. rachodes. The colour plate later published by Barla (1888) displays
basidiomes exhibiting the very same features as described in the protologue
and with an annulus that apparently diﬀers from that typically described for
Macrolepiota procera complex (Fig. 6). Most mycologists, especially those in the
Mediterranean region, have treated Lepiota permixta as a species separate from
the M. procera complex, as supported by the clearly reddening context (e.g.,
Pacioni 1979 with a very good description of Sardinian material, Bon 1993,
Bellù & Lanzoni 1987, Pázmány, 1985). Others (Candusso & Lanzoni 1990,
Migliozzi 1995, 1997, Quadraccia & Lunghini 1990) consider M. permixta a
variety of M. procera, assuming that the presence or absence of reddening is not
suﬃcient to distinguish the two taxa at species level. Pázmány (1988) showed
the great macromorphological variability of M. procera by describing eight
infraspeciﬁc taxa. Since our selected L. permixta epitype and other collections
identiﬁed as M. permixta share nearly or completely identical ITS sequences
with M. procera and M. fuliginosa, we reduce M. permixta to a morphological
form of M. procera and propose a new taxonomic combination.#Description*]
