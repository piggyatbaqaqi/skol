[@Abstract — During surveys of hyphomycetes from northeastern Uttar Pradesh, India, two
undescribed taxa were discovered, Passalora barringtoniigena sp. nov. on living leaves of
Barringtonia acutangula (Lecythidaceae), and Pseudocercospora miliusae sp. nov. on Miliusa
tomentosa (Annonaceae). These two species diﬀer from similar species morphologically.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have encountered several plant species exhibiting leaf blights during our
survey of plant diseases. Critical examination and a thorough survey of the
literature revealed that two of these blights were caused by two undescribed
species of Passalora and Pseudocercospora. Passalora is characterised by septate
coloured conidia and conidiophores with thickened scars, and Pseudocercospora
is characterised by septate coloured conidia and conidiophores without
thickened scars (Crous & Braun 2003). After comparing the fungi with all other
species reported on allied hosts, we found them to be distinct and identiﬁed
them as new species of Passalora and Pseudocercospora.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Infected leaf samples from diﬀerent parts of northeastern Uttar Pradesh were placed
in separate polythene bags and taken to the laboratory. Surface scrapings and free-hand
cut sections were prepared from infected portions of the leaf samples and mounted
in lactophenol cotton blue on microscope slides. Fungal structures were drawn under
1000× magniﬁcation with the help of camera lucida to illustrate all possible details of
morphology and ontogeny of reproductive propagules. Measurements were taken with
the help of an ocular micrometer. Morphotaxonomic determinations were made with
the help of current literature and available resident expertise. Holotypes have been#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Srivastava 1994) on B. acutangula from India and Australia. Passalora
barringtoniicola diﬀers from P. barringtoniigena in having obclavato-cylindrical,
catenate conidia with long curved tips and conidiophores that are densely
fasciculate and arise from well-developed subepidermal stromata (Crous &
Braun 2003). In P. barringtoniae-acutangulae the stromata are well developed,
the conidiophores are longer (≤ 240 µm), and the conidia are shorter and wider
(17.5–38.6 × 4.2–11.7 µm), 0–3-septate, and obclavate to broadly fusiform
(Srivastava 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

species has been described on Miliusa tomentosa, and only one, Ps. annonacea

hyaline. The only other cercosporoid species described on Miliusa tomentosa,
Passalora miliusae U. Braun & Crous (Crous & Braun 2003), has subhyaline
conidia and thickened conidiophore scars.#Misc-exposition*]
