[@Abstract — A new species, Lepiota pallidiochracea, is described. It is characterized by
the ochraceous-red squamules on pileus, large ellipsoid to oblong spores, polymorphic
cheilocystidia, and a trichodermium of elongate pileus covering, which is apically attenuate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The eastern Himalaya is one of the twenty-ﬁve hotspots for biodiversity
(Myers et al 2000), and macrofungi are very rich in the area (Yang 2005). Many
new agarics and aphyllophoroid fungi have recently been described from there
(Yang et al. 2004; Dai et al. 2007; Yuan & Dai 2008; Li et al. 2009; Dai 2010,
2011; Li et al. 2011). This paper is another contribution on the lepiotaceous
fungi occurring in the region.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The genus Lepiota (Pers.) Gray contains more than 400 described species
(Kirk et al 2008), and it is reasonable to expect many representatives of this
cosmopolitan genus in China. However, rather few taxa have been originally
described from China (Chiu 1948, Bi et al 1986, Yang 1994, Tolgor & Li 2004,
Wang & Yang 2005a,b). In our research on Lepiota in China, in addition to
several recently published new species (Liang et al 2009, 2010, 2011, Liang &
Yang 2011), several interesting and undescribed taxa still await documentation.
The present paper describes one new Lepiota species from eastern Himalaya.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For microscopic observations, sections of fruitbodies were made by hand and
mounted in 5% KOH, Congo red, and Melzer’s reagent. Basidiospores were mounted
in cresyl blue to test for a metachromatic reaction (Singer 1986). Size ranges were
determined for basidia, basidiospores, cheilocystidia, and elements of the pileipellis,
based on ocular micrometer measurements of at least 20 elements of each character.
The abbreviation [n/m/p] indicates that measurements were made on n basidiospores
in m basidiomata from p collections. Dimensions of basidiospores are given using a
notation of the form (a–)b–c(–d). The range b–c contains a minimum of 90% of the
measured values. Extreme values are given in parentheses. The following abbreviations
are used: Q refers to the length/breadth ratio of basidiospores; Q refers to the average
Q of all basidiospores ± sample standard deviation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Etymology: pallidiochracea (Lat.), referring to pale ochraceous squamules on the

[@Basidiomata (Fig. 1) small-sized. Pileus 1.5–4 cm diam., campanulate with
small umbo when young, plano-convex with obtuse umbo at maturity, cream to
whitish, at centre brownish red (10D6-8) to dark brown (9E4-8), around centre
densely covered with concentric squamules; squamules more or less uplifted,
minute, ochraceous-red (8C7-8), brown (7D8) to reddish brown (9C7-8).
Lamellae free, subventricose, moderately crowded with lamellulae, dirty white
to cream. Stipe 2–4 × 0.2–0.3 cm, subcylindrical, hollow; surface glabrous and
white at the apex, light ochraceous (7C6-7) with scattered ochraceous-red
(8C7-8), brown (7D8) to reddish brown (9C7-8) squamules at the low part.
Annulus whitish, membranous, evanescent. Odor none. Taste not recorded.

Q = 1.56 ± 0.18], ellipsoid to oblong, sometimes ovoid with small hilar
appendage in side view, with neither suprahilar depression nor germ pore,

[@Habitat & distribution: in small groups, gregarious, saprotrophic and terrestrial
on slope, in summer. Known only from southwestern China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Discussion: Lepiota pallidiochracea is characterized by its ochraceous-red

squamules on the pileus, which is covered with a trichodermium of long,
elongate, apically attenuate and short narrowly clavate elements, large ellipsoid
to oblong spores, and polymorphic cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on the trichodermium type of the pileus squamules and the ellipsoid
basidiospores, L. pallidiochracea may tentatively be placed in L. sect. Ovisporae#Misc-exposition*]

[@362 ... Liang & Yang#Misc-exposition*]
[@(J.E. Lange) Kühner (Singer 1986, Vellinga 2001), although species in the
section usually have spores smaller than 10 µm (Singer 1986). Recent molecular
phylogenetic studies indicate that section Ovisporae is not monophyletic, so
that re-evaluation of this section is needed (Vellinga 2003, Liang et al 2011).
Phylogenetically, the new species may be referred to section Lepiota or clade 1
of Lepiota s.l. (Vellinga 2003) until a new taxonomic system is proposed.
Several Lepiota species have similarly shaped spores. The polymorphic
cheilocystidia coupled with the larger spores help distinguish L. pallidiochracea
from L. brunneolilacea Bon & Boiﬀard (also a member of L. sect. Ovisporae),
L. helveola Bres. and L. ochraceoaurantiaca Dennis (Bon 1996, Candusso &
Lanzoni 1990, Dennis 1952). The larger spores are reminiscent of L. oreadiformis
Velen. (in sect. Lepiota), which, however, has much larger, fusiform to
amygdaliform spores and narrowly clavate or utriform cheilocystidia (Vellinga
2001).#Misc-exposition*]
