[@Abstract — Collections morphologically assignable to Volvariella dunensis from Sardinia
and the Atlantic coast of Spain were revised and compared with the original collections.
Molecular data supporting all examined collections as V. dunensis expand its known
geographic distribution. A revised morphological characterization and a phylogenetic
analysis of all Volvariella species sequenced to date are provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Volvariella Speg., which is composed of saprotrophic or
mycotrophic agarics, has been historically considered a member of the
family Pluteaceae Kotl. & Pouzar (Singer 1986). The genus is characterized
macroscopically by a pink spore-print, free lamellae, and a universal veil
that forms a saccate volva at the base of the stipe and microscopically by the
inverse hymenophoral trama (Singer 1986). Results from earlier molecular
studies (Moncalvo et al. 2002, Matheny et al. 2006) led to questions about
its monophyly and phylogenetic position in the Pluteaceae. More recent
research focused on the Pluteaceae (Justo et al. 2011) showed that Volvariella is
polyphyletic with two major clades. The large-spored, viscid species belonging
to the V. gloiocephala complex were resolved as the sister group of Pluteus
Fr. and accommodated under the new generic name Volvopluteus Vizzini et
al. Volvariella, the remaining clade, is therefore restricted to the dry, smallspored species. Volvariella falls outside the pluteoid clade and based on data
from ribosomal loci (nSSU, 5.8S, nLSU) shows aﬃnities to some hygrophoroid#Misc-exposition*]

[@genera (Cuphophyllus (Donk) Bon, Cantharocybe H.E. Bigelow & A.H. Sm.),
but its phylogenetic position within the Agaricales is still unclear.
Volvariella dunensis has been the subject of a detailed taxonomic study
based on the re-examination of the original collections from the Mediterranean
coast of Spain (Justo & Castro 2010). Very recently, a collection assignable to
V. dunensis was reported from the Atlantic coast of Spain (Fernández-Sasia 2010
as “Volvariella nigrovolvacea var. dunensis”). Also, the identity of the Sardinian
collection reported by Contu & La Rocca (1999) as Volvariella nigrovolvacea
Kosina was recently questioned (Justo & Castro 2010), and it comes close to the
morphological concept of V. dunensis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The purpose of this study was to determine whether the collections reported
by Fernández-Sasia (2010) and Contu & La Rocca (1999) represent V. dunensis
using both morphological and molecular characters (ITS region).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@Descriptive terminology follows Vellinga (1988) and Boekhout (1990). Microscopical
preparations from dried material were mounted in Congo Red and 5% KOH. The
following abbreviations are used in text: avl for average length, avw for average width,
Q for quotient of length and width and avQ for average quotient. Extreme measurements
are indicated within parentheses. Herbarium acronyms follow Thiers (2011) except that
“SCM” is used for the “Societat Catalana de Micologia” herbarium and RFS refers to the
personal herbarium of Roberto Fernández-Sasia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Standard methods for DNA extraction, PCR ampliﬁcation and DNA sequencing
were applied (e.g. Justo et al. 2011). Primer pairs ITS1F and ITS4 (Gardes & Bruns 1993)
were used for both PCR and sequencing. Complete information about the collections
of Volvariella that were sequenced is given in Tab. 1. The remaining sequences used
in the analysis were retrieved from GenBank and come from the studies of Menolli &
Capelari (2008), Li et al. (2009) and Justo et al. (2011). GenBank accession numbers are
given in Fig. 2. No suitable outgroup for Volvariella was found using BLAST searches
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). Therefore, after running a preliminary analysis
using Coprinus comatus (O.F. Müll.) Pers. as an outgroup for all Volvariella sequences
and taking into consideration the results from the combined nLSU-5.8S-nSSU analyses
of Justo et al. (2011), V. bombycina (Schaeﬀ.) Singer and V. volvacea (Bull.) Singer were
used as outgroup taxa in the ﬁnal dataset. These two species appear to be the sistergroup to all other species of Volvariella sequenced to date. Sequences were aligned with
MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002) using the Q-INS-i strategy. The alignment was examined
and manually corrected in MacClade 4.05 (Maddison & Maddison 2002). It has been
deposited in TreeBASE (http://purl.org/phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S11441).
Pairwise similarities were calculated using Jalview (Waterhouse et al. 2009). A Maximum
Likelihood analysis was run in RAxML servers (Stamatakis et al. 2008) with 100 rapid
bootstrap replicates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phenology — Volvariella dunensis seems to have a relatively narrow and
particular time of fructiﬁcation during the winter, spanning from the last days
of December (Sardinia) to early March (Atlantic coast of Spain).#Description*]
[@Comments—The arenicolous habitat, winter fructiﬁcation, and cystidial size
and morphology are the key characters for separating V. dunensis from other
species with grey-ﬁbrillose pilei, especially V. volvacea. Courtecuisse (1984)
reports that V. volvacea could be collected “au niveau des dunes” in the Atlantic
coast of France, and Bon & Gehu (1973) signal this species as typical of the
Ammophiletea communities. In the UK (Orton 1986), Netherlands (Boekhout
1990), and Spain (Justo & Castro 2010), V. volvacea has been consistently
reported as growing inside greenhouses or outside on organic rich substrates
(leaves, compost, sawdust). Given the external resemblance of both species it is
very likely, in our opinion, that at least some coastal records of V. volvacea from
France may, in fact, represent V. dunensis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the phylogenetic analysis, V. dunensis appears as sister to the clade
containing V. terrea Musumeci & A. Riva and the V. pusilla group (Fig. 2).
Apart from this relationship, the internal nodes of the tree receive generally low
support and many species appear on relatively long branches. This is probably a
consequence of the high level of divergence in the ITS sequences of Volvariella.
For instance, the relatively low 62% pairwise similarity between V. bombycina
and V. nivea T.H. Li & Xiang L. Chen could indicate either a high rate of
molecular change in the genus or a relatively ancient speciation event.
The number of Volvariella taxa and collections sampled for molecular analyses
is still insuﬃcient to make broad generalizations about the morphological
species-rank taxonomy. However, it seems that many characters traditionally
used for grouping species in the genus such as pileus colour (grey-brown vs.
white) or trophic strategy (litter saprotroph, lignicolous, mycotrophic) have
undergone many transitions during the evolution of Volvariella species (see
character states on Fig. 2). Additional research using both morphological and
molecular data is badly needed to gain further insights in the taxonomy and
evolution of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]
