[@Abstract— Four Endophragmiella species are described and illustrated: E. nanlingensis
occurring on dead branches of Melicope triphylla is proposed as new, and E. pulchra,
E. rostrata, and E. resinae found on dead branches of unidentiﬁed plants are recorded for the
ﬁrst time from China. The specimens are deposited in Herbarium of Shandong Agricultural
University, Plant Pathology (HSAUP) and Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences (HMAS).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sutton (1973) proposed the genus Endophragmiella to accommodate two
species, E. pallescens B. Sutton and E. canadensis (Ellis & Everh.) B. Sutton.
Subsequently, Hughes (1979) emended the genus and gave a very detailed account
of conidiogenesis and generic concepts. Endophragmiella is characterized by
macronematous, mononematous conidiophores with integrated, percurrently
proliferating conidiogenous cells and acrogenous, solitary, septate conidia
with rhexolytic secession. Presently, more than 80 species are accepted in
Endophragmiella, most of which are reported from rotten wood, dead branches,
and decaying leaves of various plants; a few species have associations with other
fungi (Sutton 1973, Hughes 1979).#Misc-exposition*]
[@During a continuing survey of saprobic fungi in tropical forests of Guangdong
Province, China, four Endophragmiella species were found on dead branches.
Endophragmiella nanlingensis is proposed herein as new, based on its distinctive
conidial characters, and E. pulchra, E. rostrata and E. resinae are recorded from
China for the ﬁrst time.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes: Endophragmiella nanlingensis is closely related to E. fusiformis W.P. Wu
(Wu & Zhuang 2005) in its proliferating conidiophores producing fusiform,
rostrate, multiseptate conidia, except that E. fusiformis produces conidia that
are narrower (7.5–9 μm) and have more (6–7) septa. In addition, the conidia
of E. nanlingensis slightly constricted at the septa, while those in E. fusiformis
are not.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Endophragmiella rostrata (Kirk 1985) and E. variabilis R.F. Castañeda
(Castañeda Ruíz 1988) are also morphologically similar to E. nanlingensis.
However, E. rostrata conidia are obclavate, smaller (13–24 × 4–5 µm), and
have fewer (3) septa, while E. variabilis produces obclavate or Y-shaped,
smaller conidia (15–23 × 4–5 µm, ramuli 9–10 × 3 µm) with fewer septa (2–4septate).

[@Notes: Endophragmiella pulchra was originally described by Sutton & Hodges
(1978) as Chaetendophragmiopsis pulchra. Kirk (1982) subsequently transferred
it to Endophragmiella based on its percurrently proliferating conidiogenous
cells and rhexolytically seceding conidia. The conidial features in our specimen
agreed well with those reported by Kirk. The species diﬀers from others
Endophragmiella species by its ellipsoid, 3–4-septate conidia with a ﬁliform
rostrum.#Misc-exposition*]

believe they represent the same species. Endophragmiella rostrata bears some
aﬃnities with E. corticola P.M. Kirk (Kirk 1982) in conidial morphology, but
E. corticola can be separated from the former by its narrowly obclavate to
broadly fusiform conidia with more variable septation (1–3(–4)-septate), more
variable conidial dimensions (1-septate conidia 14–23 × 5–6 µm, 2-septate

[@Notes: Endophragmiella resinae is similar to a group of species with obpyriform
to subglobose and 1-septate conidia, such as E. angustispora S. Hughes,
E. bukkensis Révay, E. boewei (J.L. Crane) S. Hughes, E. bogoriensis Rifai,
E. cambrensis M.B. Ellis, E. globulosa (B. Sutton) S. Hughes, E. pinicola (M.B.
Ellis) S. Hughes, E. ramiﬁcata Hol.-Jech., E. tuberculata S.M. Leão & Gusmão,
and E. uniseptata (M.B. Ellis) S. Hughes (Ellis 1976, Holubová-Jechová 1986,
Hughes 1978, 1979; Leão-Ferreira & Gusmão 2010, Révay 1987, Rifai 2008).
Endophragmiella resinae can be distinguished from most of these species by
its obovoid to pyriform conidia with an upper cell that is 1.5–3 times longer
than the lower. Endophragmiella globulosa, which has some morphological
similarities to E. resinae, diﬀers in its subglobose to broadly obovoid conidia
with a brown to dark brown upper cell and pale brown to brown basal cell.
The morphological features of our specimen overlap with the type specimen as
described by Kirk (1981).#Misc-exposition*]
