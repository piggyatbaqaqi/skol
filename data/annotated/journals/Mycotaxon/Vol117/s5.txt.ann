[@Abstract — Using morphology and molecular phylogenetic analyses, we report a new
nematophagous hyphomycete species, Arthrobotrys latispora, which produces erect, branched
or unbranched conidiophores with conspicuous nodes at the tip; the conidia are nonseptate
(41%) or uniseptate (59%) and broadly ovoid to oval. Three-dimensional adhesive networks
formed in the presence of nematodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nematode-trapping fungi have been the subject of decades-long research,
including their ecology, distribution and systematics, due in part to their
potential as biological control agents to manage plant and animal nematode
diseases (Liu et al. 2002, Liu & Zhang 2003, Dong et al. 2004). These fungi are
able to trap and consume nematodes with modiﬁed hyphae that include stalked
and sessile adhesive knobs, adhesive nets, and constricting or non-constricting
rings. Species forming adhesive nets are assigned to the anamorphic genus
Arthrobotrys Corda, which currently comprises about 50 species (Scholler et
al. 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pﬁster (1994) was the ﬁrst to connect an Arthrobotrys species to the
ascomycetous genus Orbilia on the basis of cultural studies. Up to now, six
species of Arthrobotrys have been linked to related Orbilia teleomorphs. Orbilia
auricolor (A. Bloxam) Sacc., seemingly a species complex, is known to have four
anamorphs: A. oligospora Fresen., A. cladodes Drechsler (Pﬁster & Liftik 1995),
A. yunnanensis M.H. Mo & K.Q. Zhang (Mo et al. 2005), and A. psychrophila
(Drechsler) M. Scholler et al. (Rubner 1996). Of the remaining two species, O.#Misc-exposition*]

undescribed Orbilia sp. with A. nonseptata Z.F. Yu et al. (Li et al. 2009).
A survey of Orbilia species and their anamorphs revealed one Arthrobotrys
species that had not yet been characterized. As neither morphological
comparison nor phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
regions of rRNA genes could assign this isolate to a previously named taxon, it
is reported here as a new species, Arthrobotrys latispora.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Collection, isolation, and characterization of teleomorph fungi and their anamorphs#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fresh specimens of an Orbilia species were collected on decaying bark of Castanopsis
orthacantha Franch. (Fagaceae), located in the northwest part of the YongPing County
(25°7′18″–25°13′44″N 99°27′26″–99°36′07″E), Yunnan Province, China where the
dominant plant species are Castanopsis orthacantha, Lithocarpus variolosus Chun,
Cyclobalanopsis glauca Oerst., and Cinnamomum glanduliferum (Wall.) Meisn.
Specimens are preserved in the herbarium of the Biology and Chemistry College of Dali
University, China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@To cultivate the fungus, four apothecia were ﬁxed to the lid of a Petri dish with
hymenia positioned downward in order to collect discharged ascospores on the surface
of CMA media (20 g corn meal, 18 g agar, 40 mg streptomycin, and 30 mg ampicillin
in 1000 ml distilled water). These Petri dishes were placed at room temperature for
4–6 days until the ascospores germinated. Agar blocks with deposited ascospores
were transferred to another CMA plate to avoid contamination and incubated at 25°C.
After 10–15 days, the cultures were examined with an Olympus BX51 microscope
with diﬀerential interference contrast. Trapping organs were induced by adding ~100
nematodes (Panagrellus redivivus Goodey) to a square slot (1 × 1 cm) created by
removing the agar at the colony edge.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genomic DNA was extracted from the mycelia grown on cellophane membrane on
PDA according to Jeewon et al. (2002). Primer pairs ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990)
were used to amplify the complete ITS + 5.8S region. PCR ampliﬁcation parameters were:
1 minute initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 minute denaturation
at 94°C, 1 minute primer annealing at 50°C, 1.5 minutes extension at 72°C, and a
ﬁnal extension period of 10 minutes at 72°C. The puriﬁed PCR products were directly
sequenced in forward and reverse directions using the same PCR primers (BGI Co.,
Ltd., China).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Complete ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 rDNA sequences were aligned with 20 sequences
(obtained from GenBank, NCBI [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]) by MUSCLE (MUltiple
Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) at the EBI (European Bioinformatics
Institute) web server [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/muscle/index.html]. ITS4 and ITS5
sequences were excluded from the analysis of all taxa. The DNA matrix of 21 taxa and
496 nucleotides was adjusted manually to improve the alignment. Phylogenetic analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Arthrobotrys latispora sp. nov. (China) ... 31#Misc-exposition*]

[@was conducted with MrBayes v3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Alignment gaps
were treated as missing data; the sequence ﬁle set as interleaved; and GTR model was
used for the substitution model. Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and
trees were sampled every 10th generation resulting in 100,000 trees. About 0.003 average
standard deviation of split frequency was achieved. The ﬁrst 25,000 burn-in phase trees
were discarded while the remaining 75,000 trees were used for calculating posterior
probabilities in the consensus tree. The consensus tree was analyzed by the program
FigTree v1.3.1. (Rambaut & Drummond 2010). The GenBank accession numbers of all
the analyzed sequences were indicated after names of the species on the phylogenetic
tree.#Misc-exposition*]

that Arthrobotrys and Drechslerella species group into two diﬀerent clades, with

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are six known species of Arthrobotrys with nonseptate conidia, some
of which form both uni- and nonseptate conidia. Conidia of A. amerospora
(Schenck et al. 1977) and A. nonseptata (Li et al. 2009) are consistently
nonseptate while those of A. anomala (Barron & Davidson 1972), A. botryospora
(Barron 1979), and A. yunnanensis (Mo et al. 2005) are occasionally uniseptate.
A. arthrobotryoides sensu Drechsler (1944), which consistently forms uniseptate
conidia at 20°C, also forms many nonseptate ones at 28–32°C. Van Oorschot
(1995) has noted that the identity of A. arthrobotryoides (Berl.) Lindau in
its original sense cannot be determined from the protologue and cannot be
resolved because of the absence of type material.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Arthrobotrys latispora is characterized by its broad, ovoid or slightly oval,
partly nonseptate conidia, which are borne on nodes. Based on conidial shape,
A. latispora most closely resembles A. arthrobotryoides sensu Drechsler and
A. amerospora. The conidia of all three species are ovoid but diﬀer in conidial
size and septation. Diﬀerences between A. latispora and the other six known
species that form non-septate conidia are summarized in Table 1.
Three additional collections also made on 20 September 2008 in the same
region were associated with the same teleomorph but produced a very diﬀerent
anamorph referred to the genus Anguillospora. The question arises as to whether
A. latispora is a contaminant, a conclusion supported by the fact that a similar,
closely related teleomorph, O. luteorubella (Nyl.) P. Karst., also produced a
similar Anguillospora anamorph (Pﬁster 1997).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Despite the nearly identical conidial morphology of A. latispora and
A. botryospora, our molecular phylogenetic analysis pointed out a clear diﬀerence#Misc-exposition*]

[@Arthrobotrys latispora sp. nov. (China) ... 35#Misc-exposition*]

[@between these two species: the ITS1+5.8S+ITS2 rDNA sequence similarity
between A. latispora and a non-type isolate of A. botryospora is 93.7%. Thus
A. latispora and A. botryospora can be considered two distinguishable species.
The phylogenetic analysis also showed that Dactylellina species were basal to
both Drechslerella and Arthrobotrys. These results support the hypothesis of Li
et al. (2005) that the trapping devices of Drechslerella species (with constricting
rings) and Arthrobotrys species (with adhesive networks) developed
independently from adhesive knobs (ancestral types of trapping devices
speciﬁc to Dactylellina). Moreover, the analysis indicates that Arthrobotrys
species may have evolved from Dac. haptospora relatives, whereas Drechslerella
species evolved from Dac. phymatopaga relatives. More studies are needed to
investigate the evolutionary process of these predacious fungi.#Misc-exposition*]
