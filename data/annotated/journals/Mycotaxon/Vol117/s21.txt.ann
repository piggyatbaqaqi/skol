[@Abstract — Pseudocercospora kamalii (Mycosphaerellaceae, Capnodiales) is associated
with severe leaf spot disease of Terminalia chebula (Combretaceae) in natural forests of
Mahabaleshwar in the Western Ghats of India. Morphological characterization reveals that
the new species proposed has some aﬃnity with the species of genus Prathigada. However,
based on the molecular sequence data (LSU and ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2) generated in the present
study, we established its identity as a species of Pseudocercospora. The species is also compared
morphologically with other Pseudocercospora species reported on Terminalia from diﬀerent
parts of the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microfungal diversity of northern Western Ghats has been well
explored in the recent past (Karandikar & Singh 2010, Rajeshkumar et al. 2010,
2011; Singh et al. 2009, 2010; Waingankar et al. 2008). During January 2011
a survey was conducted to explore the microfungal diversity in the natural
forests of Mahabaleshwar, situated in the northern part of the Western Ghats,
India, at 17°58′N 73°43′E. An unusual synnematous cercosporoid species was
discovered that caused a severe foliar disease in Terminalia chebula. The present
study aimed to identify the causal agent of the foliar infection on Terminalia in
northern Western Ghats, India using morphological and molecular methods.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Isolates and morphology— Synnemata of the fungus were directly isolated from
the surface of fallen fruits and observed under a Nikon Binocular stereo microscope
(Model SMZ-1500 with Digi-CAM, Japan). Single conidial cultures were established#Misc-exposition*]

[@228 ... Rajeshkumar & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@on 2% potato dextrose agar plates (PDA; Crous et al. 2009a). For morphotaxonomic
studies and photomicrographs an Olympus (Model CX-41, Japan) microscope was
used. Conidia and conidiomata were mounted in lactic acid cotton blue and measured
using an ocular micrometer, with 30 observations per structure. Colony characteristics
in culture were studied on two diﬀerent media: 2% malt extract agar (MEA) and PDA
(Crous et al. 2009a). Herbarium specimens were deposited in the Ajrekar Mycological
Herbarium (AMH); the culture was accessioned and preserved in the National Fungal
Culture Collection of India (NFCCI; WDCM-932), Agharkar Research Institute, Pune,
India under accession number NFCCI 2344.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing— Total DNA was extracted
from cultures grown on PDA plates for two weeks at 25 ºC, using a FastDNA® SPIN kit
as per the manufacturer’s instructions (MP Biomedicals GmbH, Germany). Fragments
containing the region encoding the 28S nrDNA (LSU) and ITS 1-5.8S nrDNA-ITS
2 (ITS) were ampliﬁed using primer pairs LROR (Rehner & Samuels 1994) and LR7
(Vilgalys & Hester 1990) for LSU; ITS4 and ITS5 (White et al. 1990) for ITS. DNA
ampliﬁcation was performed in a 25 µl reaction using 2 µl of template DNA (10–25
ng), 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Genei, Bangalore, India), 2.5 µl of 10× Taq DNA
polymerase buﬀer, 0.5 µl of 200 µM of each dNTPs (Genei, Bangalore, India), 0.5 µl of
10 pmol primer, H2O (Sterile Ultra Pure Water, Sigma) to make up 25 µl. Ampliﬁcation
in an Eppendorf Mastercycler AG used the following parameters: 5 min at 95 °C; 30
cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 30s at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for the ITS region ampliﬁcation;
and ﬁnal 7-min extension step at 72 °C. DNA ampliﬁcation of LSU followed the ITS
conditions except for a 52 °C annealing temperature. The PCR products were puriﬁed
with an Axygen PCR cleanup kit (Axygen Scientiﬁc Inc, CA, USA) and sequenced with
the same primers using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems, USA). The sequencing reactions were run on an ABI 3100 automated DNA
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis— LSU & ITS sequences from
P. kamalii were aligned manually using the text editor option of the Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software v4.0. (Tamura et al. 2007). The manually edited
NFCCI 2344 sequences were deposited in the NCBI sequence nucleotide database (ITS:
JF 824126, LSU: JF 824127). They were also subjected to a BLAST search of the NCBI
Genbank nucleotide database. The ITS sequences were aligned using Clustal W together
with the homologous regions of ITS of closely related species of Pseudocercospora Speg.

[@The alignment for the Pseudocercospora LSU phylogenetic analyses
comprised a total of 481 positions in the ﬁnal dataset, of which 128 were
parsimony informative. The LSU sequence analysis presented here (Fig. 1)
reveals the systematic position of the new species within Pseudocercospora,
along with its 11 closely allied sister genera in Mycosphaerellaceae. The LSU
phylogenetic sequence analysis implied 12 main clades: Pseudocercospora,
Dothistroma Hulbary, Ramularia Unger/Mycosphaerella s. str., Sonderhenia
H.J. Swart & J. Walker, Cercosporella Sacc., Ramulispora Miura, Septoria Sacc.,
Cercospora Fresen., Lecanosticta Syd., Phaeophleospora Rangel, Zasmidium
Fr., and Polythrincium Kunze. All Pseudocercospora species clustered
together to form a major clade. The new species, P. kamalii, clustered close to
Mycosphaerella musicola R. Leach ex J.L. Mulder in the major Pseudocercospora
clade. Botryosphaeria visci (Kalchbr.) Arx & E. Müll. (DQ 377868.1) and
B. rhodina (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Arx (DQ 377858.1) in the Botryosphaeriaceae
served as outgroup taxa.#Misc-exposition*]
[@For the phylogenetic analysis of closely related Pseudocercospora species,
the ITS sequence data alignment of 487 bp included 452 positions in the ﬁnal
data set. The analysis of ITS sequence shown in Fig. 2 reveals a signiﬁcant
association of Pseudocercospora representatives, some with Mycosphaerellalike teleomorphs. The ITS sequence analysis implied four major clades, with
Pseudocercospora eumusae Crous & Mour. (= Mycosphaerella eumusae Crous &
Mour.) forming a unique clade (94% bootstrap support). However, P. tereticornis

(F.L. Tai) Deighton, and P. atromarginalis (G.F. Atk.) Deighton clustered
together to form a major group in the Mycosphaerellaceae. Pseudocercospora
musae (Zimm.) Deighton (= Mycosphaerella musicola) also formed a unique
clade (100% bootstrap support). Our new species, P. kamalii, (66% bootstrap
support), separated as sister to the Pseudocercospora musae (AY 646475.1 & AY
646474.1) clade. Cladosporium herbarum (Pers.) Link (= Davidiella tassiana
(De Not.) Crous & U. Braun) (DQ 289799.2) was chosen as the outgroup, as
it belongs to the family Davidiellaceae that is allied to the Mycosphaerellaceae

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new species, Pseudocercospora kamalii, is morphologically quite
unusual and obscure within Pseudocercospora, as it exhibits many characters
that match the genus Prathigada. Among these, the thick conidial septations
and wall pattern are mostly identical with species of Prathigada. Only a few
cercosporoid species with similar morphological characters (thick-walled,
multi-septate, pigmented conidia containing slightly thickened and darkened
scars) have been transferred to Prathigada (Braun 1996; Furlanetto & Dianese
1999; Sutton 1994), most being retained in Pseudocercospora. Thus far, 15
species are recorded under the genus Prathigada. Initial morphological studies
also made it evident that Pseudocercospora kamalii is morphologically close to
Prathigada terminaliae (Syd.) B. Sutton recorded on Terminalia spp. (Sutton
1994). However, P. kamalii has synnematous conidiomata, smaller conidia, and
fewer conidial septa. Furthermore, the LSU and ITS sequence analyses accurately
deﬁned the species boundaries and placed P. kamalii into Pseudocercospora.
Crous et al. (2009b) recently stated that due to the unavailability of cultures,
no decision could yet be made on the phylogenetic placement of several less
well-known genera such as Prathigada Subram. within the Mycosphaerellaceae.
A recollection, epitypiﬁcation and detailed phylogenetic analysis of the type
species, Prathigada cratevae (Syd.) Subram. on Crateva religiosa G. Forst.
from India, is needed to reveal the exact relation of the genus Prathigada with
Pseudocercospora and their placement in Mycosphaerellaceae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sutton (1994) also reported six Pseudocercospora taxa on Terminalia
spp. from India: P. arjunae B. Sutton (on T. arjuna), P. brevis B. Sutton (on
T. bellerica), P. catappae (Henn.) Y.L. Guo & X.J. Liu (on T. catappa,
T. tomentosa, T. arjuna), P. chebulae B. Sutton (on T. chebula), P. combretacearum#Misc-exposition*]

[@236 ... Rajeshkumar & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@R.K. Verma & Kamal var. combretacearum (on T. bellerica, Terminalia sp.), and
P. combretacearum var. minima B. Sutton (on T. bellerica); he also reported two
other species: P. neodeightonii B. Sutton (on T. albida from Sierra Leone) and
P. zambiensis (Deighton) B. Sutton (on T. mollis from Zambia). Kamal (2010:
347) listed P. catappae, P. chebulae, and P. combretacearum var. combetacearum
from Indian T. chebula. These three species diﬀer from P. kamalii in various
morphological characters; most conspicuously, they have mononematous,
fasciculate, or sporodochial conidiophores in contrast with the synnematous
conidiophores of P. kamalii, which is the only synnematous Pseudocercospora
species recorded on Terminalia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the present study, P. kamalii is proposed as a new species based on the
LSU & ITS sequence analysis (Fig. 1, 2) and morphological characterization
(Fig. 3, 4). Phylogenetically, P. kamalii is closely related to Pseudocercospora
musae (66% bootstrap support) on Musa spp. (Arzanlou et al. 2008, Braun et
al. 1999). With its distinct synnemata with a well-developed basal stroma and
larger conidiophores and conidia, P. kamalii is morphologically distinct from
Pseudocercospora musae and all other taxa with higher phylogenetic similarity.#Misc-exposition*]
