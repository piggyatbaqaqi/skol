[@Abstract — During a recent excursion in Iğdır region (Turkey), we sampled lichens from
two localities, among which Lecanora wrightiana and Rhizocarpon inimicum were determined
as new to Turkey and the Middle East. Geographic distribution, substrate, chemistry, and
comparisons with morphologically similar taxa are presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Compared to other countries, not many lichen studies have been conducted
in Turkey, so the lichen ﬂora of Turkey remains poorly known. Recently, many
lichen taxa have been recorded for Turkey (Yazici et al. 2010a,b,c, Candan &
Halici 2009, Candan et al. 2010, Kinalioğlu & Aptroot 2010, Kinalioğlu 2010a,b),
but more studies are needed to form a complete lichen ﬂora. No lichenized
fungi have previously been reported for Iğdır region.#Misc-exposition*]
[@To date, 27 Rhizocarpon species and 95 Lecanora taxa have been reported
from Turkey. At least 18 parasitic Rhizocarpon species are known from Europe
(Poelt & Hafellner 1983, Poelt & Vězda 1984, Timdal 1986), but only one
parasitic species (Rhizocarpon epispilum on Pertusaria rupicola) has been found
from Turkey (Breuss & John 2004).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Material & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Iğdır, one of the poorest forested areas in Turkey, is dominated by steppe. Rich grassy
plants cover the surface of the province. Mountain Zordağ (Iğdır: Center) is a welllit, very high, windswept, open treeless area with gently sloped terrain with streams,
grass and rocks. Prunus, Pyrus, and Populus trees are dominant in Üçkaya village (Iğdır:
Tuzluca) with Salix and Elaeagnus occasionally present (Baytop & Denizci 1963). The#Misc-exposition*]

[@146 ... Yazici, Aptroot & Aslan#Misc-exposition*]
[@climate is characterized by hot and dry summers with moderate precipitation, and cold,
snowy winters with high precipitation. Mean annual temperature is 11.6°C. The mean
annual rainfall is about 257.6 mm. Mean annual humidity is 63%. (Akman 1999).
The lichen specimens were collected from Iğdır region on 13–14 June 2010. Air-dried
samples were examined with Nikon SMZ1500 stereomicroscope and a Nikon Eclipse
80i light microscope. Identiﬁcations were determined by consulting keys (Guderley &
Lumbsch 1999, Miyawaki 1988, Poelt 1990, Poelt & Vězda 1984, Upreti 1997). Vouchers
are stored in the herbarium of the Biology Department, Karadeniz Technical University,
Trabzon, Turkey (KTUB).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks— By its campestris-type amphithecium, L. wrightiana is similar
to L. elapheia, which, however, contains eight spores per ascus and produces
triterpenoids.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lecanora wrightiana occurs mainly on bark and more rarely on rocks in
mountain regions. Previously known from Japan and India, it seems to be
especially common in Japan (Miyawaki 1988, Guderley & Lumbsch 1999). New

[@Remarks—Rhizocarpon species with dark brown or grey-green ascospores
placed in subg. Phaeothallus —R. advenulum, R. epispilum, R. inimicum,
R. santessonii and R. schedomyces— have 1-septate to submuriform spores
(Poelt & Hafellner 1983, Poelt & Vězda 1984), but R. santessonii has the
smallest ones (Poelt & Vězda 1981). Rhizocarpon epispilum does not have an
amyloid medulla or vegetative hyphae (Timdal 1986) and produces 2-septate
spores, while R. inimicum has 1-septate spores with vertical to crosswise septa.
Rhizocarpon advenulum, R. epispilum, and R. schedomyces grow on Pertusaria
spp.; R. santessonii grows on Tremolecia atrata; and R. inimicum grows on
Lecanora rupicola.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Rhizocarpon inimicum grows parasitically on Lecanora rupicola (Poelt and
Vězda 1984). Not many parasitic Rhizocarpon species have been reported in
Turkey, probably because little lichenological research has been performed. If
studies on the lichen ﬂora of Turkey are continued, we hope that the number of
recorded Rhizocarpon species can be increased. Previously known from Spain
and Portugal. New to Turkey and Asia.#Misc-exposition*]
