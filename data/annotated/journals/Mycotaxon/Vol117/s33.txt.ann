[@Abstract — We report additional examples of pyrenomycetous fungi that display the
biogeographical pattern known as the Grayan disjunction. Daldinia grayana and Diatrypella
informis are described as new species, and Nemania pseudoillita is proposed as a new
combination.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Additional collecting trips and visits to several diﬀerent herbaria have
revealed a number of specimens that warranted a re-identiﬁcation. The data
available on their distribution indicate that they display the biogeographical
pattern known as the Grayan disjunction, which was discussed in a previous
paper (Vasilyeva & Stephenson 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Two types of this distribution pattern have been observed in pyrenomycetous
fungi—vicariance and non-vicariance. In addition, there are two other groups
of fungi restricted to either eastern Asia or eastern North America that do not
have close relatives in the other region. Although these two groups of species are
seemingly pertinent to the two regions under consideration, the biogeographical
patterns they exhibit have diﬀerent explanations, which will be considered in a
forthcoming paper. The purpose of the present paper is to provide additional
information relating to the Grayan disjunction in pyrenomycetes and to discuss
certain aspects of this pattern.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments–The appearance of Daldinia grayana is similar to that of
D. gelatinosa Y.M. Ju et al. as the latter is illustrated (Ju et al. 1997, Fig. 44) and
described (Ju et al., 1997, p. 270: “Stromata... sessile or short stipitate, solitary or
aggregated, wrinkled, ...surface dark brick, blackened and varnished in age...”).
It is also noteworthy that D. gelatinosa appears to have a similar distribution
in eastern North America and is reported from Ontario (Canada), Idaho, and
New Hampshire. The latter record is associated with Betula alleghaniensis, as is
one record of D. grayana.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The resemblance of Daldinia gelatinosa to D. grayana is reinforced by the
fact that one piece of the exsiccate of ‘Daldinia concentrica’ in Ellis & Everhart’s#Misc-exposition*]

[@334 ... Vasilyeva & Stephenson#Page-header*]
[@“Fungi Columbiani 213” was identiﬁed as D. gelatinosa (Ju et al. 1997: WSP
1781), whereas we identify another piece (MICH 71993) as Daldinia grayana.
Except for this questionable material, D. gelatinosa diﬀers from D. grayana in
having dark-livid KOH-extractable pigments rather than gray- or greenish-olivaceous pigments, as well as in the nature of the inner tissue of the stromata.#Misc-exposition*]
[@This tissue in D. gelatinosa is similar to that of D. ﬁssa Lloyd in having the
alternating zones of dark brown and white, which are initially gelatinous but
disintegrate and become loculate when dry. In contrast, D. grayana has stromata
that are solid inside, and their alternating zones are only darker and lighter
tinges of brown, although sometimes the lighter zones are cream-colored.
Based on the abundant material from Michigan, Daldinia grayana might be
more of a northern or high elevation species (cf. the record from Newfound
Gap) than D. gelatinosa; in this respect, D. grayana is similar to D. loculata
(Lév.) Sacc., which occurs on birch (Betula spp.) in the more northern parts
of the Holarctic; when D. loculata is found in more southern regions, it occurs
primarily in the mountains.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In terms of the substrate preferences (Alnus spp., Betula spp.), Daldinia
grayana should be also compared with D. decipiens Wollw. & M. Stadler,
which is known to occur on Betula spp. in Europe (Stadler et al. 2001b), and
D. petriniae Y.M. Ju et al. described on Alnus also from Europe (Ju et al. 1997)
but later found to be circumpolar (Stadler et al. 2001b, p. 175). Only one locality
for D. petriniae in the United States is from the Paciﬁc coast region (Stadler et
al. 2001a, c). This species diﬀers from D. grayana in having larger, more fragile
stromata, livid purple or dark livid pigments, and a ﬁnely papillate stromatal
surface (similar to the condition illustrated by D. childiae J.D. Rogers & Y.M. Ju
as seen on the website http://mycology.sinica.edu.tw/Xylariaceae). We have a
specimen of D. petriniae on Alnus hirsuta from China (Heilongjiang Province)
collected in 2004. The pigments in its stromata display pale-vinaceous-grey
pigment in 10% KOH instead of livid purple or dark livid, but it is the same
portion of the color spectrum in contrast to greenish-olivaceous tints observed
in D. grayana.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Daldinia decipiens is similar to D. petriniae in having purple, dark livid
or vinaceous purple KOH-extractable pigments (Stadler et al. 2001b).
Morphologically, these two species are sometimes diﬃcult to distinguish,
although D. decipiens appears to have larger ascospores; it also diﬀers from D.
petriniae in the smaller, often stipitate, stromata with a smooth surface and
more solid inner tissue with brown zones of very close tinges. In addition, the
stromata of D. decipiens are reddish brown, especially the stalks, whereas those
in D. petriniae are mostly brown vinaceous. The color is shared by D. decipiens
with D. grayana, but the stromatal pigments and consistency easily distinguish
them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The rather large robust stromata and non-sulcate ostioles of D. informis
are similar to those found in D. verruciformis (Ehrh.) Nitschke, which diﬀers
by possessing larger asci (120–200 × 8–12 µm: Nitschke 1867) and longer
ascospores (6–8 µm long). The 4–6 µm range in ascospore length is used
to segregate many species in the Diatrypaceae; examples include Diatrype
hypoxyloides De Not., Diatrypella decorata Nitschke, Eutypa mela (Schwein.)
Cooke, Eutypella kochiana Rehm. The regularly repetitive size ranges in diﬀerent
genera of the family are always very helpful in delimiting certain species within
these families.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hypoxylon dearnessii and H. massulatum#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections carried out in the vicinity of the University of Michigan
Biological Station (UMBS, located near Douglas Lake, Michigan) in 2010
revealed a Hypoxylon species with rather variably shaped, often undulate
stromata. This species was associated with Acer rubrum. Some of its superﬁcial
features suggested Hypoxylon dearnessii (Ju & Rogers 1996: Figs. 11A–B),
recorded from maples only in eastern temperate North America and originally
described from the vicinity of the city of London (Ontario, Canada) in the same
general Great Lakes region as the UMBS area.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The KOH-extractable pigment in the Michigan specimen was the color of
sienna (as in H. dearnessii), and the ascospores exhibited a similar size range
(9–11.5 × 4.5–6 µm), although with a slightly larger range in length (9–12.5 ×
4.5–5.5 µm) and with many more obovoid with one end narrowly rounded and
the other broadly rounded, as in H. fuscopurpureum (Schwein.) M.A. Curtis.
Hypoxylon fuscopurpureum diﬀers in having greenish-olivaceous pigments
and larger ascospores, but it and the Michigan specimen both have perispores
that are indehiscent in 10% KOH. The perispore is important in delimiting
Hypoxylon species and, in fact, prevents our assigning the Michigan specimen
to H. dearnessii, which has a dehiscent perispore. Nonetheless, the specimen
is provisionally identiﬁed as H. dearnessii (VLA P–2519) and is accessible for
future comparative studies.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Hypoxylon dearnessii is known from Canada (Ontario, Quebec) and the
United States (Colorado, Maine, New York) (Ju & Rogers 1996; Stadler et
al. 2008). Specimens deposited in the Farlow Herbarium (all as ‘Hypoxylon
rubiginosum’), were collected in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, and Vermont, mostly on Acer rubrum. The eastern North
American temperate zone is home to H. dearnessii, but there are some collections
from eastern Asia that resemble this species. Especially suggestive is a specimen
collected in 2000 on Acer ukurunduense from the Big Khekhtsir Nature Reserve
(Khabarovsk Territory, Russia), because its stromata have the same shape as
H. dearnessii, and the substrate was maple. However, specimens with the same
type of stromata were collected later on Ulmus spp. in the Primorsky Territory
(Russia) and in Heilongjiang Province (China).#Misc-exposition*]
[@A close examination of the stromata of specimens on Acer ukurunduense
and Ulmus spp. showed their KOH-extractable pigment to be bright red instead
of sienna, and they were also found to have smaller ascospores (mostly 7.5–8.5
× 3.8–5 µm) with an indehiscent perispore. Further comparisons showed that
these stromata are very similar to those in Hypoxylon massulatum described
from Alnus hirsuta (Vasilyeva 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@We did not discuss the Grayan disjunction in pyrenomycetous fungi as part
of an overview of biogeographical problems in our previous paper (Vasilyeva
& Stephenson 2010). Especially interesting in this context is the vicarious
pattern. The occurrence of the same species in two widely separate regions of
eastern Asia and eastern North America could be attributed to the persistence
of Tertiary relics following continental fragmentation, but the occurrence
of intercontinental vicarious pairs of species (or varieties) is not so easily
understood.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Vicarious taxa usually have very minor morphological diﬀerences (e.g.,
ascospore size), and it is diﬃcult to explain why Biscogniauxia maritima
Lar.N. Vassiljeva (ascospores 13–16 µm long) occurs only in the southern
portion of the Russian Far East, north-east China, Japan, and Korea, whereas
B. atropunctata (Schwein.) Pouzar (ascospores 24–33 µm long) is restricted to
eastern North America. Both species occur on Quercus spp., and the ascospore
size diﬀerence seems unlikely to have adaptive signiﬁcance. We cannot identify
any association between the environmental conditions in the two regions
and the observed diﬀerences. Moreover, in some vicarious pairs, for example
Nemania illita and N. pseudoillita (see above) or Hypoxylon notatum Berk. &
M.A. Curtis and H. ulmophilum Lar.N. Vassilyeva (Vasilyeva & Stephenson
2010), the species with larger ascospores were found in East Asia. In the latter
case, the substrate restriction of H. notatum and H. ulmophilum to Quercus spp.
and Ulmus spp., respectively, also appears very strange, since representatives
of both host genera are abundant in the two disjunctive areas. Although both
species have plentiful host resources, they do not seem to jump from one host
genus to another in eastern Asia or eastern North America.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Despite their close similarity, vicarious taxa cannot be ancestors and
descendants to each other, since, if such is the case, there should be some
common area of speciation. And even if such an area existed and became
fragmented later, it is inexplicable how such fragmentation has so strictly#Misc-exposition*]

[@divided the populations in such a way that all ‘ancestors’ (with the same
ascospore size) appear to be conﬁned to either Asia or North America, whereas
all ‘descendants’ occur on the other region. An additional hypothesis to account
for their origin might suggest that only one species existed before continent
fragmentation, and the second species evolved as a deviation of the ﬁrst after
long period of isolation of the two regions. However, once again it is not clear
why the ancestral species disappeared completely from one fragment of the
disjunctive region.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The most probable explanation of the vicariance pattern might be attributed
to the position of continents during the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods (Fig.
4). Even during these earlier times, the present land masses of East Asia and
eastern North America were widely separated. Therefore, the isolation of
vicarious taxa was an original occurrence that only increased over time. The
vicarious taxa may have been peripheral populations of some species otherwise
widely distributed over Laurasia (the northern part of Pangaea).#Misc-exposition*]
[@It is particularly common for isolated populations at the margins of a range
for a given species to exhibit certain distinct features, and clearly distinct
peripheral populations are often observed on islands (Ridley 2003). During the
Tertiary, the last phase of the breakup of Pangaea, widely separated areas with
their own distinctive populations would have became biogeographical ‘islands’,
and the vicarious taxa that exist today may simply represent fragments of the
same ancestral species.#Misc-exposition*]
