[@Abstract — Described is Cortinarius callimorphus, a new species in subgenus Phlegmacium
from the coastal woods of northern California, with Sitka spruce to its apparent primary host
associate. Cortinarius callimorphus, which resembles other members of sect. Multiformes,
stands out because of its citriform spores. Its closest known relative is C. polymorphus from
Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ecosystem of the northernmost coastal region of California (Del Norte,
Humboldt, and Mendocino counties) is inﬂuenced by high annual precipitation
averages (CalFire 2011) that are characteristic of the Paciﬁc Northwest temperate
rainforest and which support its dominant conifers —Picea sitchensis (Bong)
Carrière (Sitka spruce) and Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. (western hemlock).
The extensive wet forests of the region support a rich fungal diversity. The
types of approximately two-thirds of the Cortinarius species described from
California have been collected in this region (Smith 1939; Ammirati & Smith
1977; Moser & Ammirati 1997, 2000). Cortinarius callimorphus, described
here, is common under Sitka spruce along the northern Californian coast.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Methods for morphological studies and DNA extraction, PCR conditions and
primers, PCR product clean up, and sequencing are outlined in Bojantchev & Davis
(2011). Color codes follow Munsell™ soil color charts (Anonymous 2000). Terminology
follows Brandrud et al. (1998). Collections are stored in the private herbarium of the
ﬁrst author or at the University of California herbarium in Berkeley (UC) where noted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@During our studies we have downloaded and reviewed all Cortinarius nrDNA
sequences from the public databases GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and
UNITE (http://unite.ut.ee/). Preliminary phylogenetic analysis (not shown) of 984
Phlegmacium nrITS sequences from the northern hemisphere, including 278 sequences
from our own collections, clariﬁed the closest relatives of C. callimorphus and resolved
its position outside of the calochroid super-clade as deﬁned by Frøslev et al. (2007) and
Garnica et al. (2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Twenty Phlegmacium taxa were selected for a detailed phylogenetic analysis. Sixteen
sequences were sourced from GenBank and four sequences representing western North
American taxa came from our collections. The breakdown of the selected sequences is
four members of the calochroid super-clade; two sequences of C. callimorphus plus one
of its closest known relatives; 13 sequences of the most representative taxa of the nearest
stirpes to C. callimorphus — /anserinus, /viridicoeruleus, /multiformis and /glaucopus
from both Europe and Western North America. Cortinarius calochrous var. coniferarum
(M.M. Moser) Nezdojm. was selected as an outgroup.#Misc-exposition*]

nrITS. The alignments were visually inspected and corrected where needed.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Parsimony method as
implemented by MEGA5 (Tamura et al. 2007). The MP trees were generated by the
Close-Neighbor-Interchange algorithm with search level 0 in which the initial trees were
obtained with the random addition of sequences (10 replicates). The search resulted in
nine most parsimonious trees (length = 249) which only diﬀered in the topology of the
terminal nodes. One tree was selected (Fig. 1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat and distribution — Very common under Sitka spruce in Northern
California, particularly in the Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte counties. We
have never seen it south of Mendocino. Its distribution within the Sitka spruce
range is apparently limited to northern California and southern Oregon (where
we have collected it once). There are no matching records from Washington and
British Columbia despite the intensive collecting and molecular cataloguing
that has taken place in these regions. There are no other closely matching North
American collections in the public sequence databases.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Traditional morphological analysis based on the overall combination
of stature, a yellowish viscid pileus, and argillaceous lamellae suggests that
C. callimorphus belongs to sect. Multiformes Rob. Henry ex Brandr. & Melot.
Its carmine-red KOH reaction on the pileus of and submarginate bulb suggest
that C. callimorphus might be related to the calochroid cortinarii, but its welldeveloped hypodermium (duplex pileipellis) supports placement in sect.
Multiformes.
Within that section, C. callimorphus stands apart with its distinctly
citriform spores, a relatively uncommon feature in the non-calochroid clades.
Cortinarius polymorphus Rob. Henry is the only other species known with
similar macromorphological features (particularly lacking any blue colors) and
similarly shaped citriform spores. Detailed descriptions of C. polymorphus are
available in Henry (1935, 1951, 1985) and Bidaud et al. (2007); the latter includes
quality iconography. Molecular analysis conﬁrms a close relationship between
the two species (Fig. 1). Cortinarius polymorphus has also been assigned to
Multiformes by Henry (1935, 1951, 1985), Moser (1960), and Bidaud et al.
(2007).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recent phylogenetic studies within Cortinarius (Garnica et al. 2003) and
our own nrITS analysis show that sect. Multiformes is not well supported. Most
taxa traditionally assigned to it belong to various other Phlegmacium clades.
It is not the aim of this work to present a detailed picture of the infrageneric
relationships within subg. Phlegmacium, but as shown in Fig. 1, C. callimorphus
and C. polymorphus form a clade that is a sibling to the stirpes around
C. viridicoeruleus Chevassut & Rob. Henry and C. anserinus (Velen.) Rob.
Henry. A common character of these clades is the distinctly citriform spores.
Cortinarius callimorphus and C. polymorphus are very similar but can be
separated based on diﬀerences in geography (with the former found only in
western North America and the latter in Europe), nrITS sequences, and host
associations. Cortinarius polymorphus is apparently associated with broadleaved
trees, mainly members of Fagaceae, while C. callimorphus is associated with
Picea and possibly other conifers. The spores of C. polymorphus also appear
slightly broader with Qav = 1.5 vs. Qav = 1.7 for C. callimorphus. Henry (1935)#Misc-exposition*]
