[@Abstract — A new species, Gymnopus fuscotramus, is described from China. It is
characterized by brown-incarnate colors in pileus and lamellae, sulcate pileus, free and
distant lamellae, ﬂoccose-squamulose, mostly black stipe, well-developed black rhizomorphs,
repent and diverticulate pileipellis hyphae, abundant clamp connections, diverticulate to
coralloid cheilocystidia, moderately thick-walled caulocystidia with obtuse apex, dextrinoid
hyphae in cortex of stipe, and gray-brown pileal and hymenophoral trama. Color images of
basidiomata and microscopic elements accompany the description. Gymnopus fuscotramus
is compared with similar species and its systematic position is also inferred using the ITS
rDNA sequence data.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@During ﬁeld research on marasmioid fungi in southern China (Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region), the third author collected an interesting
fungus which is described here as a new species of the genus Gymnopus
(Pers.) Roussel. According to morphological characters, it belongs to section
Androsacei (Kühner) Antonín & Noordel., which is characterized by small
and marasmioid basidiomata, thin, insititious and mostly dark colored stipe,
usually well-developed black rhizomorphs, dextrinoid trama of stipe and
non-hymeniform pileipellis (Antonín & Noordeloos 2010). Members of this
section were traditionally placed in the genus Marasmius (Fries 1838). Kühner
(1933) described section Androsacei under the same genus. On the basis of#Misc-exposition*]

[@322 ... Mešić & al.#Page-header*]
[@its non-hymeniform pileipellis, Antonín (1987) excluded members of the
section Androsacei from Marasmius, and described a new genus Setulipes.
Molecular phylogenetic studies published by Moncalvo et al. (2002), Mata et
al. (2004) and Wilson & Desjardin (2005) showed that the type species of the
genus Setulipes, S. androsaceus (L.) Antonín, belongs to the gymnopoid clade.
Therefore, Noordeloos & Antonín (2008) transferred section Androsacei to the
genus Gymnopus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The description of Gymnopus fuscotramus is based on one collection consisting of
seven basidiomata, which were photographed in the ﬁeld. Color codes in the macroscopic
description (given in brackets) are cited according to Kornerup & Wanscher (1981).
Microscopic features were observed with a light microscope (brightﬁeld and phase
contrast – PhC) under magniﬁcation up to 1500× and photographed with a digital
camera. Description and images of microscopic characters were made from rehydrated
specimens mounted in 2.5% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. Amyloidity and
dextrinoidity were tested in Melzer’s reagent (Erb & Matheis 1983). Basidiospore
measurements were calculated from mounts of lamellae and based on calibrated
digital images. A total number of 50 randomly selected basidiospores from two mature
basidiomata were measured. Spore measurements (length, width) are given as: (min.) stat.
min. – av. – stat. max. (max), where “min.” = minimum (lowest measured value), “stat.
min.” = statistical minimum (arithmetic average minus two times standard deviation),
“av.” = arithmetic average, “stat. max.” = statistical maximum (arithmetic average plus
two times standard deviation), “max.” = maximum (highest measured value). Standard
deviation (SD) of spore length and width is also given. The length/width ratio of spores
is given as the “Q” value (min. – av. – max.). The holotype is deposited in the Herbarium
of Guangdong Institute of Microbiology (GDGM), while an isotype is deposited in
the Croatian National Fungarium (CNF). Comparison of Gymnopus fuscotramus with
similar taxa is based on revision of type specimens of Marasmius nigroimplicatus Corner
(E 206719) and M. subrigidichorda Corner (E 206861), as well as descriptions in the
following literature: Petch 1948, Singer 1976, 1989, Pegler 1986, Desjardin 1987a,b,
Corner 1996, and Antonín 2007.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Genomic DNA was isolated from dried material with E.Z.N.A. forensic kit (Omega
bio-tek) according to manufacturer’s protocol for isolation of DNA from hair, nails and
feathers. The primers ITS1F and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used for ampliﬁcation
and sequencing of ITS region, containing the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions of rDNA.
PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in a total volume of 25 µl. The initial denaturation
step at 95 °C for 85 s, was followed with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 35 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and
72 °C for 60 s. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three positive clones were sequenced using the
pUC or T7 vector primers with the ABI BigDye Ready Reaction Kit on an ABI 3100
automated sequencer. Sequencing reads were assembled using Lasergene processing
software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, USA) and checked manually for sequencing errors.
Sequence, submitted to GenBank with accession number JF303730, was compared#Misc-exposition*]

[@by homology searches with known sequences using BLAST (Benson et al. 2003). ITS
sequences from 25 species taken from NCBI were used for further analysis. An alignment
of the sequences was performed using Clustal X (Thompson et al. 1994). Ambiguously
aligned regions were determined and excluded from further analyses using the online
version of the program Gblocks 0.91b, under less stringent parameters (Castresana
2000). Final alignment was 620 bp long (available upon request). Jmodeltest (Posada
2008, Guindon & Gascuel 2003) was used to select the best-ﬁt model of nucleotide
substitution. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using Bayesian MCMC, maximum
parsimony (MP) and Neighbor-joining (NJ) methods. Four species of Marasmius were
selected as outgroup taxa for rooting purposes. Bayesian inference of the phylogeny
using Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses (Geyer 1991) was
performed using MrBayes, version v. 3.1.2. (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003), under the
Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano + gamma (HKY+G) model, which incorporates diﬀerent rates
for transitions and transversions and rate variation across sites. MCMC sampling was
performed as implemented in MrBayes with the default settings (two runs of four chains
each) for 10,000 generations, with the ﬁrst 10% discarded as burn-in. MrBayes was used
to compute a 50% majority rule consensus of the remaining trees to obtain estimates for
the posterior probabilities (PPs) of the groups. Branch lengths were computed as the
mean values over the trees sampled after burn-in. MP and NJ analyses were performed
in Mega version 4 (Tamura et al. 2007). Relative robustness of individual branches was
estimated by bootstrapping (BS), using 1000 replicates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to morphological characters, Gymnopus fuscotramus belongs to
section Androsacei. However, our phylogenetic analysis using only ITS rDNA
sequences do not place our taxon on the same clade with the two sequenced
species from that section, G. androsaceus (L.) J.L. Mata & R.H. Petersen and
G. quercophilus (Pouzar) Antonín & Noordel. However, G. fuscotramus is
placed close to G. peronatus (Bolton) Gray (sect. Vestipedes). To further clarify
phylogenetic relationships between G. fuscotramus and other Gymnopus
species (especially from sect. Androsacei), more species (reliably identiﬁed)
and more DNA sequences should be included in analyses. Our gymnopoid
clade also includes Marasmiellus and Rhodocollybia species, which is in
