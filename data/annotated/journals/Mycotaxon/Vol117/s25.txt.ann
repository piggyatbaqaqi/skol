[@Abstract — The saxicolous lichen species, Caloplaca allochroa, is described as new from
subtropical inland localities of Gangwon and Jeollanam Province (South Korea). It is
characterized by occurring as two colour variants, yellowish and gray, based on presence vs.
absence of anthraquinone pigments. Its colour contrast between brownish-red to brownishblack apothecial disc and yellowish-orange apothecial margin is very characteristic. Further
diagnostic characters are a hymenium with numerous oil-drops and speciﬁc ecology. The
species is related to Caloplaca ﬂavorubescens and C. ﬂavovirescens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@A study of specimens of the genus Caloplaca Th. Fr. collected during ﬁeld
trips in the mountains of South Korea by L. Lőkös and Y. Joshi, revealed an
interesting and unusual saxicolous species, which is described here as new
to science. The new species has been found only at inland localities in three
mountains, Mt Jobong, Mt Taebaek, and Mt Gyeokja. It grows in open woodlands
on siliceous and non-calcareous rocks together with abundant members of
Aspicilia, Cladonia, Heterodermia, Lecanora, Leptogium, Myelochroa, Pertusaria,
Phaeophyscia, Porpidia, and Ramalina.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Although we obtained only three specimens of this new taxon, we describe
it without any hesitation because 1) the species is morphologically well deﬁned,#Misc-exposition*]

[@262 ... Joshi & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@2) one may wait for too a long time to obtain more material of this rare taxon
when conservationists and scientists could beneﬁt from the data, 3) DNA
evidence supports our hypothesis, and 4) the material was collected in ample
amount and duplicates sent to several herbaria.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Studied specimens are deposited in CBFS, KH, KoLRI, UCR and the private herbarium
of J. Halda (Czech Republic). Description and photographs of external morphology
are based on air-dried material observed under a dissecting stereomicroscope (Nikon
SMZ645). Sections were made with a razor blade under the stereomicroscope and
mounted in lactophenol cotton blue. Anatomical descriptions are based on these
preparations under a compound microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200). The mycological
terminology follows Kirk et al. (2008). Measurements of ascospores were made at
×400 magniﬁcation mounted in water; only free ascospores lying outside the asci were
measured. The results are recorded as 95% conﬁdence interval of the measured values.
Number of measurements (n) is within square brackets. Chemical constituents were
identiﬁed by HPLC (Søchting 1997).#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA extraction and amplification. Direct PCR was used for PCR-ampliﬁcation
of the ITS regions including the 5.8S gene of the nuclear rDNA following Arup (2006).
Primers for ampliﬁcation were ITS1F (Gardes & Bruns 1993) and ITS4 (White et al.
1990). PCR cycling parameters follow Ekman (2001).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analysis. Five newly obtained ITS sequences were included in the
phylogenetic analysis along with six sequences from GenBank (Tab. 1) to illustrate
the phylogenetic position of Caloplaca allochroa within the Caloplaca ﬂavorubescens/
C. ﬂavovirescens clade. Caloplaca crenularia and C. ferruginea were selected as outgroup.
Sequences were aligned using BioEdit and manually cut to eliminate the unaligned#Misc-exposition*]

Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the program MrBayes 3.1.1
(Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). The optimal nucleotide substitution model (GTR+G)
was found using the program MrModeltest v2.3 (Nylander 2004) with the Akaike
Information Criterion and the hierarchical likelihood ratio test (Posada & Crandall
1998). The MCMC analysis was run for one million generations, performed in two runs,
each with four chains starting from a random tree and using the default temperature of
0.2. Every 100th tree was sampled, and the ﬁrst 215,000 generations were discarded as
burn-in, using standard deviation of splits between runs less than 0.01 as a convergence
criterion.#Misc-exposition*]

(Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ecology and distribution — Caloplaca allochroa is so far known only
from three mountains (Mt Jobong, Mt Taebaek, and Mt Gyeokja) in South
Korea. The species occurs on non-calcareous rocks in subtropical inland areas
at elevations from 350–980 m. It grows both on subvertical and horizontal faces
of the rocks, preferring situations with suﬃciency of diﬀuse sunlight, under
open canopied stands. Both yellow and gray-white morphotypes are reported
from Mt Jobong and Mt Gyeokja, while in Mt Taebaek only the gray-white
morphotype has been collected.#Misc-exposition*]

but by Leptogium, Phaeophyscia, Myelochroa, Pertusaria, and Lecanora on Mt

Pinus, and Quercus occur in all three C. allochroa localities, the new taxon has

[@Remarks — This is a distinctive species characterized by the colour variation
shown by its thallus (yellow to gray), dark brown-red biatorine apothecia with
yellow-orange margin, and inspersed hymenium. The colour of the areoles is#Misc-exposition*]

[@266 ... Joshi & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@yellow and the discs are orange brown without traces of black colour in less sunexposed sites but on the strongly exposed rock faces, the thallus is distinctly
gray and the apothecia are brownish-black.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The yellow morphotype of the new species is most likely to be confused
with the saxicolous Caloplaca ﬂavovirescens or the corticolous C. alnetorum
Giralt et al., C. ﬂavorubescens, and C. gordejevii (Tomin) Oxner ex Khodos., but
none of the latter possesses such a strong colour contrast between apothecial
disc and margin. Gray-white thallus morphotypes are similar to saxicolous
Caloplaca egeana Cl. Roux & Nav.-Ros. and C. subochracea (Wedd.) Werner, and
corticolous C. aegatica Giralt et al., which also diﬀer in apothecial coloration.
Caloplaca lypera Poelt & Hinter., a similar species from temperate or subalpine Himalayan regions, cannot be confused with this taxon, as it diﬀers in
having yellowish medulla and ochraceous-gray thallus (Poelt & Hinteregger
1993; Joshi & Upreti 2011). The combination of parietin and fragilin as main
anthraquinones in the new species is rare within Caloplaca; it is known (as
in C. ﬂavovirescens and C. ﬂavorubescens; Santesson 1970) and described as
chemosyndrome B1 by Søchting (2001).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Existence of two colour thallus variants based on presence vs. absence of
anthraquinones is probably not exceptional in Teloschistaceae; it has been
recently described in Caloplaca phlogina (Ach.) Flagey (Vondrák et al. 2010)
and also occurs in the North American C. stanfordensis H. Magn. (Vondrák,
unpublished data).#Misc-exposition*]
