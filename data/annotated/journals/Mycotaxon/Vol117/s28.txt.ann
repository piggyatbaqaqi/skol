collected from Houhe National Nature Reserve, Wufeng, Hubei, China is described and
illustrated with cymbiform conidia 18.5–22.0 × 4.5–5.0 µm, constricted at proximal and

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sycopsis sinensis is a native broadleaved evergreen woody plant species
in China. It grows in mixed evergreen broadleaved forests or bushes and is
sporadically distributed at elevations of 1000–2000 m in southern China (Li et
al. 2003). However, the largest population of S. sinensis as the dominant species
was reported in the Houhe National Nature Reserve by Liu et al. (1999).
A ﬁeld trip was made to the Houhe National Nature Reserve (29°59′–
30°10′N 110°22′–110°52′E) in Wufeng Tujia Autonomous County, Hubei,
China to collect hyphomycetes in August 2008. A species of Rhexodenticula
new to science was discovered on decaying leaves of Sycopsis sinensis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Conidiophores and conidia of the fungus were mounted in 85% lactic acid. Tape
lifts were prepared for wet mounting using Mainstays Crystal Clear Tape (Imported by
Walmart Canada, Mississauga, Ontario). Microscopic observations were made using
bright ﬁeld and Nomarski diﬀerential interference contrast optics. Photomicrographs
were taken with an Olympus Microﬁre digital camera (Goleta, CA). Herbarium
acronyms follow the Index Herbariorum (Holmgren & Holmgren 1998). Measurements
of the fungal structures were statistically analyzed with Microsoft Oﬃce Excel 2007#Misc-exposition*]

[@character of releasing conidia by rhexolytically splitting a separating cell. The
genus previously had two species, Rhexodenticula elegiae Melnik et al. (Mel’nik
et al. 2004) being the second. Rhexodenticula zhengii adds a third species.
All three species have four-celled conidia. Rhexodenticula cylindrospora has
cylindrical conidia with four cells of equal length (Castañeda et al. 1996, Baker
et al. 2001), while conidia of R. elegiae and R. zhengii are much shorter with
paler end cells. The conidia of R. zhengii are obclavate, larger, and constricted at
basal and distal septa: these characters can diﬀerentiate it from R. elegiae, which
has fusiform conidia with unconstricted septa.#Misc-exposition*]
