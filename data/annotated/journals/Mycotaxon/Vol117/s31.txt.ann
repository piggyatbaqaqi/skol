Abstract — Puccinia cortusae has been found parasitizing Cortusa brotheri from northern
Pakistan. This ﬁrst report from Pakistan and southern Asia also establishes C. brotheri as
a new host for the rust fungus. We believe this is the ﬁrst report of P. cortusae since it was
ﬁrst described in 1904. New observations of one-celled teliospores and variable germ pore
position supplement the original description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Worldwide, the Primulaceae comprises ca. 24 genera and 1000 species, (most
of which represent herbs conﬁned mainly to north temperate regions), among
which only around 28 species have been recorded as alternate or (sometimes)
primary hosts for 18 rust species and ﬁve genera (Arthur & Cummins 1962,
Wilson and Henderson 1966, Hiratsuka et al. 1992, Farr & Rossman 2011).
Although 60 species (eight genera) representatives of the Primulaceae have
been reported from Pakistan, not a single species has been from the country as
a host for rust fungi.#Misc-exposition*]
[@During the present study, Cortusa brotheri was found parasitized by Puccinia
cortusae. With this addition, the number of rust fungi has been raised to 73
from Fairy Meadows, Pakistan (Afshan et al. 2009, 2011).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@During the survey of rust fungi from Pakistan, Cortusa brotheri was collected from
Northern Pakistan, Fairy Meadows, 3036 m a.s.l., occupying rock crevices along a running
stream. A healthy ﬂowering plant was also collected for accurate host identiﬁcation.
Free hand sections of infected material and spores were mounted in lactophenol. Semipermanent slides were prepared by cementing cover slips with nail lacquer (Dade &
Gunnell 1969). Preparations were observed under a Nikon YS100 microscope and#Misc-exposition*]

[@photographed with a digipro-Labomed (USA). Spore drawings were made using a Leitz
Camera Lucida (Wetzlar, Germany). Twenty-ﬁve spores were measured using a Zeiss
ocular micrometer (St Albans, England). Measurements include range and arithmetic
means with extremes shown in parenthesis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spermogonia, aecia and uredinia not seen. Telia hypophyllous, rarely
epiphyllous, circinate, pulverulent, covered by ruptured epidermis, naked, along
or between veins, 70–140 × 280–400 µm. Teliospores pale brown to chestnut
brown, ellipsoid, broadly ellipsoid or obovoid, rounded or attenuated at base,
slightly or not constricted at septum, chestnut brown at septum, 16–25(–31) ×
24–37 µm (mean 22.2 × 29 µm); wall chestnut brown, smooth, 1–1.6 µm; germ
pore one per cell, with variable position, mostly apical, sub apical or sometimes
adjacent to septum in distal cell; in proximal cell mostly adjacent to septum,
sometimes shifted ½ to ¾ towards hilum, germ pores with hyaline papillae;
apex not thickened, rounded, sometimes conical; pedicel hyaline, deciduous,
short, sometimes obliquely attached, 5–11 × 3–20 µm. One-celled teliospores
and aberrant teliospores with additional oblique or perpendicular septa present
but rare.#Description*]

[@Comments: Among new observations made for P. cortusae not mentioned
in the original description are the presence of both two-celled and one-celled
teliospores that are broader (15–21 µm in the original). Teliospore germ pores
were observed in diﬀerent positions, e.g., apical, subapical, or sometimes
adjacent to the upper cell septum although they were mostly observed in the
lower cell adjacent to the septum or sometimes shifted half or three-quarters of
the distance toward the hilum.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Puccinia cortusae is the only rust fungus reported on Cortusa L., and
has previously been known only from the type collection on C. matthioli L.
from the Alai Range in southern Kyrgyzstan (Sydow & Sydow 1904: “in jugo
Alaico Turkestaniae”; Farr & Rossman 2011). Our collection is a new record of
P. cortusae for southern Asia and C. brotheri is a new host for this rust fungus.
The two hosts are closely related, with C. brotheri sometimes treated as a form
of C. matthioli, C. matthioli f. brotheri (Pax ex Lipsky) R. Knuth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gäumann (1959) described Puccinia cortusae as a microform (telial stage
only) of P. primulae Grev. Teliospores resemble those of P. primulae in shape
although they diﬀer in size, those of P. cortusae being longer and broader
(16–25(–31) × 24–37 µm vs. 15–18 × 22–30 µm) with chestnut brown wall,
variable position of germ pores and apically unthickened.#Misc-exposition*]
