[@Abstract — We describe Amanita vernicoccora, a vernal fruiting species known as the
“spring coccora” in California. Sequence analyses of four DNA regions and phenotypic
traits demonstrate that A. vernicoccora, long considered a pale-colored form of the autumnal
fruiting A. calyptroderma (the ‘fall coccora’), is a unique species. Morphological and genetic
data support both species in section Caesareae. We also address some nomenclatural and
taxonomic intricacies surrounding application of the proper name for the fall-fruiting
coccora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The popular name —‘coccora’ or ‘coccoli’— was coined by Italian-Americans
in California for two valuable edible mushrooms of genus Amanita Pers.
collected during the fall and spring. The autumnal fruiting A. calyptroderma
(referenced here as the ‘fall coccora,’ Fig. 1a) and the vernal fruiting
A. vernicoccora (referenced here as the ‘spring coccora,’ Fig. 1b) are closely
related and were for many years considered conspeciﬁc seasonal color forms.
Both taxa represent subg. Amanita sect. Caesareae Singer and are close relatives
of A. caesarea (Scop.) Pers. —the European ‘Caesar’s amanita’— a popular
edible in Europe, especially in Italy. The coccora has a notable thick cottony veil
that leaves a distinctive monolithic velar remnant on the pileus. The association
with a thick-walled cocoon enveloping the Amanita egg is the etymological
origin of the popular name.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Due to the perceived conspeciﬁcity of the two coccora, the autumnal name
was used for both species, currently referenced as either A. calyptroderma or
A. lanei. Both names are still used in various reference materials and ﬁeld#Misc-exposition*]

of the rich and intricate nomenclatural and taxonomic history surrounding the
choice of the proper scientiﬁc name for the fall coccora are discussed here.
Nomenclatural and taxonomic history of the fall coccora#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita calyptroderma G.F. Atk. & V.G. Ballen, Science, n.s. 29: 944. 1909.#Nomenclature*]
[@?= Amanita calyptrata Peck, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club 27:
14. 1900 [nom. illegit., non Lam. 1783].#Nomenclature*]
[@≡ Venenarius calyptratus Murrill, Mycologia 4: 241. 1912 [nom. nov.].#Nomenclature*]
[@≡ Venenarius lanei Murrill, N. Amer. Fl. 10: 75. 1914 [nom. nov. superﬂ.].#Nomenclature*]
[@≡ Amanita lanei Sacc. & Trotter, Syll. Fung. 23: 5. 1925 [nom. nov.].#Nomenclature*]

[@The fall coccora was ﬁrst validly named as Amanita calyptrata (Peck 1900) based
on autumnal collections from ﬁr woods in Oregon and notes by Dr. H. Lane.
When ﬁrst published, this name was legitimate, but under the retrospective
application of the current International Code of Botanical Nomenclature
(ICBN Art. 53.1; McNeill et al. 2006), it is an illegitimate later homonym of
A. calyptrata Lam. Murrill (1912) “recombined” the name as Venenarius
calyptratus —under ICBN Art. 58.1, this must be interpreted as a legitimate
nom. nov., with priority dating from 1912. Two years later, Murrill (1914) had
become aware of the later homonymy of Peck’s binomial (illegitimate under the
1907 American Code of Botanical Nomenclature) and published V. lanei as a
nom. nov. based on Peck’s description and typiﬁcation. However, under ICBN
Art. 52.1, the name V. lanei was a superﬂuous (i.e., illegitimate) synonym of
V. calyptratus, and consequently the “recombination” Amanita lanei published
by Saccardo & Trotter (Trotter 1925) must also be interpreted as a legitimate
nom. nov. under ICBN Art. 58.1.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In 1909 George Atkinson described A. calyptroderma (Atkinson 1909a,b)
based on autumnal collections, several diagnostic photographs of fresh
material, and supplemental notes from Virginia Ballen from Brookdale,
Santa Cruz Co., California. According to the Atkinson papers in the CUP
Herbarium, the collections were sent from California in fresh condition and#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita vernicoccora sp. nov. (California, USA) ... 487#Page-header*]

[@arrived at Cornell University on Dec 7, 1908 with some basidiomata partly
decayed. The major elements of the collection notes match the A. calyptroderma
protologue (Atkinson 1909a,b). The date of the collections, the description, and
the photographs published in Atkinson (1909c) leave no doubt that the name
A. calyptroderma was applied to the familiar fall coccora (Fig.1a, Fig. 10).
Apparently, Atkinson (1909c) was aware of Peck’s earlier species and makes
a single reference to A. calyptrata in the footnote of his description —“closely
related to Amanita calyptrata Peck, Bull. Torr. Bot. Club 27:14.1909 [sic, =
1900], but diﬀers in color and other characters.” Contrary to Atkinson’s view,
most resident California taxonomists consider A. calyptroderma and A. lanei
(≡ A. calyptrata) conspeciﬁc. Taxonomically, we believe that A. calyptroderma
faithfully represents the fall coccora. Moreover, if we accept conspeciﬁcity with
A. lanei/V. calyptratus (dating from 1912), A. calyptroderma (dating from 1909)
has nomenclatural priority. [It should be noted that under the ICBN, until 1981
the correct name for this conspeciﬁc taxon was Amanita calyptrata, because it
remained legitimate and had priority over A. calyptroderma. This situation was
reversed when the 1981 International Botanical Congress (Sydney) moved the
starting point date for agaric nomenclature back from 1821 to 1753, making
A. calyptrata Peck a nom. illegit.]#Misc-exposition*]
[@Nevertheless, there are lingering doubts about the exact identity of
A. lanei, as the original description by Peck notes green tinges on the pileus.
In our experience, the fall coccora frequently develops olive-brown tints in age
or when exposed to colder weather but we would not describe the color as
green (Fig. 10c). Olive-brown tints, for example, are commonly observed on
specimens from the Sierra Nevada foothills. It is also possible that the stronger
color qualiﬁcation of “green” was used instead of “olive,” a common style in
many early descriptions. Nonetheless, the green color has been stressed in
numerous taxonomic treatments as an important diagnostic character. Zeller
(1931) states: “These two species, A. calyptrata Peck and A. calyptroderma
Atkinson and Ballen, are very similar and diﬃcult to distinguish. The main
distinction is the greenish tinting of the pileus and gills in A. calyptrata...”
Hotson (1936) supported this view that the green tints were a key diagnostic
character in his treatment of the amanitas of Washington. Although it is
unclear whether these authors personally collected green- tinted specimens,
we cannot discount the possibility that A. lanei refers to a rarely collected
unique species from the more northern areas of the Paciﬁc Northwest. This
prospect is additionally corroborated by the suggested association of A. lanei
with ﬁr per its original description. In contrast, the fall coccora is primarily
associated with broadleaved trees in California. Therefore, we believe that
on both nomenclatural and taxonomic grounds, the correct name for the fall
coccora is A. calyptroderma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@488 ... Bojantchev, Pennycook & Davis#Page-header*]
[@Murrill (1912, 1914) and Zeller (1931) synonymized Amanita calyptroderma
and A. calyptratoides Peck, although it appears that Murrill never collected or
examined either species. Current researchers do not accept this synonymy,
and we also consider it to be clearly an error. The macromorphological traits
of A. calyptratoides —such as the relatively smaller size (4–8 cm), gray-brown
to plumbeous pileal colors, and particularly the evanescent to inconspicuous
annulus— contrast sharply with the features of A. calyptroderma as supported
by the very diagnostic original photographs (Atkinson 1909c). The current
interpretation of A. calyptratoides refers to a small species, common under oaks,
with primary distribution of southern California and Mexico (Tulloss 2011).
The conspeciﬁcity of fall vs. spring coccora#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conspeciﬁcity of the fall and spring fruiting coccora was assumed at
the time of the ﬁrst descriptions and that view generally has not changed.
While Peck and Murrill do not seem to have been aware of the existence of a
spring fruiting species, Atkinson was and discussed it at length. The original
description of A. calyptroderma (Atkinson 1909a,b) clearly referenced the fall
species based on the time of collection and the colors he speciﬁed — “pileus
maize yellow to pale chrome yellow.” Very soon after that, based on the input
of his experienced California correspondent, Virginia Ballen, he oﬀered a more
elaborate description of the pileus colors (Atkinson 1909c), including the spring
form, “The pileus is a maize-yellow in its bright-colored forms and varies to a
pale straw color or Naples yellow (R.) in the vernal forms.”
Regarding the vernal fruiting habit of the coccora, Atkinson (1909c)
developed an elaborate hypothesis:#Misc-exposition*]
[@“It occurs in the high Sierras and in the Coast Range. Probably the entire
summer season is needed for the growth and extension of the mycelium
in the forest mold, so that the huge fruit bodies are developed in late
autumn and early spring. While we have as yet no information bearing
on the time of origin of the fundament of the fruit bodies, it is likely that
all of them are formed during the summer and late autumn, and that the
second crop, which appears early in the spring, is composed of plants
which have lived through the winter in a partially developed condition.
The autumn crop ceases about the last of December, while the spring
crop begins about the middle of March.”#Misc-exposition*]
[@Contemporary authors of inﬂuential ﬁeld guides in California (Arora 1986,
Wood & Stevens 2009) continue to reﬂect the notion of the conspeciﬁcity and
seasonal color diﬀerences between the fall and spring coccora. At the same
time, the awareness that they are likely diﬀerent species has grown in recent
years. Smith et al. (2007) ﬁrst reported that the fall and spring coccora diﬀer
signiﬁcantly in their ITS sequences.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat and distribution — Amanita vernicoccora fruits in the late winter
and spring and is apparently restricted to California. Along the coast and in the
lower elevations of Sierra Nevada (<2000 feet) it fruits in February–March and
is known to associate with evergreen oaks such as live oak (Quercus agrifolia
Née), interior live oak (Quercus wislizenii A. DC.) and blue oak (Quercus
douglasii Hook. & Arn.). Likely associations are also to Paciﬁc madrone
(Arbutus menziesii Pursh) and manzanita (Arctostaphylos manzanita Parry).
Infrequently, A. vernicoccora fruits in the northern coastal areas where it is likely
associated with tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiﬂorus (Hook. & Arn.) Manos et
al. This species is far more common in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and
Shasta Cascade range in May–June where the primary association in the lower
elevations (2000–4000 feet) is with the deciduous black oak (Quercus kelloggii
Newb.). At higher elevations A. vernicoccora may switch association to conifers,
but we have not seen it outside of the range of the black oak (≤6000 feet).

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both A. vernicoccora and A. calyptroderma are beautiful species, distinguished
by a thick, cottony, white velar remnant on the pileus that remains whole into
maturity. This feature makes them among the easier amanitas to identify.
The edibility of the fall coccora, A. calyptroderma, was extolled by both Peck
(1900) and Atkinson (1909a), who made references to its gastronomical virtue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While considered conspeciﬁc, A. vernicoccora also was presumed edible and is
widely collected for the table. Even though practical experience has shown that
both coccora are relatively safe choices as edibles, confusion with other toxic
Amanita species do occur and the possibility of dangerous misidentiﬁcation
must be stressed. The standard word of caution is that several reliable taxonomic
factors must be evaluated before an Amanita collection is deemed safe for
consumption.#Misc-exposition*]

with members of the deadly toxic sect. Phalloideae (Fr.) Quél. —Amanita

Amanita gemmata (Fr.) Bertill. clade, or gemmatoid amanitas (Fig. 12a), which
