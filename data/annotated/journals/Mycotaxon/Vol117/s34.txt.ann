[@Abstract — During studies of palm fungi, a new Lignincola species was found in Thailand.
It diﬀers from other members of the genus in ascospore dimensions and the occurrence of its
ascomata on the adhesive pad of a marine invertebrate. Lignincola conchicola is described and
illustrated, and a key to Lignincola species is provided. The palm Phoenix is a new substratum
for marine fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@During research on palm fungi in Thailand (Pinnoi et al. 2004, 2006,
2009, 2010, Pilantanapak et al. 2005, Pinruan et al. 2004a,b, 2007, 2010a,b,
Rungjindamai et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2010) a new taxon collected on Phoenix
paludosa in Ranong mangrove, was discovered. The taxon is characteristic of
Lignincola (Halosphaeriaceae).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Höhnk (1955) introduced Lignincola for a single species L. laevis Höhnk,
which was characterized by black perithecioid ascomata, persistent clavate
to fusiform, thin-walled asci lacking an apical apparatus, and 1-septate
hyaline ascospores lacking appendages. The genus diﬀers from Aniptodera,
Halosarpheia, and Phaeonectriella in lacking appendaged ascospores (Pang et al.
2003a,b, Jones et al. 2009). Three other Lignincola species have been described.
One, initially described as Gnomonia longirostris Cribb & J.W. Cribb (Cribb
& Cribb 1956), was later transferred to Lignincola by Kohlmeyer (1984). Pang
et al. (2003a) subsequently transferred the species to a new genus Neptunella#Misc-exposition*]

[@344 ... Liu & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@based on ultrastructural and molecular evidence. Asci in N. longirostris have
an apical pore, retraction of the plasmalemma, and ascospores with a thin
mucilaginous sheath (Pang et al. 2003a). A second species, Lignincola tropica
Kohlm., was described from mangrove wood (Kohlmeyer 1984) and has larger
ascospores than L. laevis. The identity of this species is confused as initially the
asci were described as possessing an apical pore, but subsequently Kohlmeyer
& Volkmann-Kohlmeyer (1988) revised the description by stating that there
was no pore to the ascus. In addition, sequence data show that collections with
asci with an apical pore do not belong in Lignincola (Pang unpublished data).
A third species, L. nypae K.D. Hyde & Alias (Hyde et al. 1999), was described
from the brackish water palm Nypa fruticans and has clavate asci with a
refractive apical thickening with a pore and cylindrical ascospores, features not
found in Lignincola. A molecular study is required to resolve the placement of
both L. tropica and L. nypae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The new species Lignincola conchicola is described and illustrated and a key

[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Palm fronds were collected from Ranong mangrove, Ranong Province, Thailand.
Samples were processed and examined following the methods outlined by Hyde
et al. (2000) and Taylor & Hyde (2003). Several unsuccessful attempts were made to
isolate and grow the fungus from single ascospores. Morphological measurements and
photomicrographs were made according to Liu et al. (2010). The holotype is deposited
in the herbarium of Mae Fah Luang University (MFLU), Chiang Rai, Thailand.#Misc-exposition*]

Discussion#Key*]

[@Most taxa referred to Halosphaeriaceae are marine, usually with welldeveloped perithecioid ascomata that are globose, light or dark, and usually
with an ostiole lined with periphyses (Müller & Arx 1962, Kohlmeyer 1972).
Paraphyses are absent, catenophyses generally deliquesce if present, asci are
clavate to ellipsoidal, thin-walled, unitunicate and deliquesce early, generally
lacking an apical apparatus or pore, and ascospores are hyaline to light brown,
unicellular or one to several septate, often with appendages or surrounded by a
mucilaginous sheath (Shearer & Miller 1977, Jones 1995, Sakayaroj et al. 2011).
A few transitional species of this family have been found in freshwater and
brackish water habitats, including some species of Aniptodera, Ascosacculus,
Halosarpheia, Lignincola, Luttrellia and Nais (Shearer & Miller 1977, Shearer
1989, Jones 1995, Pang et al. 2003a,b, Jones et al. 2009, Sakayaroj et al. 2011).
The morphological characteristics of Lignincola conchicola ﬁt well within this
family.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Jones et al. (2009) suggested that the genus Lignincola has only one
unifying character — the hyaline 1-septate ascospores without appendages. In
L. conchicola, asci are persistent and thin-walled and lack an apical apparatus
(Plate 1 D–F) and ascospores are thin-walled and lack appendages (Plate 1
G–K). Lignincola conchicola diﬀers from other species in the genus in ascospore
dimensions and the persistent occurrence of ascomata on the adhesive pad of
a marine invertebrate.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lignincola conchicola is most similar to L. laevis, the type species of the
genus. The two taxa have similarly shaped asci and ascospores. They diﬀer in
that L. laevis has larger ascospores (13−24 × 5−8 µm) and the ascomata are#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lignincola conchicola sp. nov. ... 347#Nomenclature*]

[@necked. Lignincola tropica diﬀers from L. conchicola in having larger ascospores
(22−36 × 12−16 µm) and in being thick-walled (Jones et al. 2009), Lignincola
nypae can be distinguished from the new species by the presence of an apical
apparatus in the ascus and cylindrical ascospores (Hyde et al. 1999, Pang et al.
2003a, Jones et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Three genera —Aniptodera, Gesasha, Nais— are also morphologically similar
to Lignincola with some species with 1-septate, unappendaged ascospores
(Shearer & Miller 1977, Kohlmeyer 1984, Crane & Shearer 1986, Abdel-Wahab
& Nagahama 2011). In the type species of Aniptodera, the ascus is clavate with an
apical pore and apical retraction of the plasmalemma, while the ascospores are
thick-walled. Three species were described when Abdel-Wahab & Nagahama
(2011) introduced Gesasha, and the ascospore dimensions and shape are quite
similar to L. conchicola. However, Gesasha diagnostic characters include a
periphysate neck, asci with an apical thickening, and pore features that exclude
L. conchicola (Abdel-Wahab & Nagahama 2011). The two currently accepted
Nais species diﬀer from L. conchicola in ascospore dimensions and deliquescing
asci (Pang et al. 2003a, Jones et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
