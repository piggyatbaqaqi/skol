Mycotaxon is pleased to announce the addition of a new url link on our “web-list” page
at www.mycotaxon.com//resources/weblists.html, which will connect to the checklist PDF
now available for free download from the posted oﬀ-site webpage. The content and design
of each list is the sole responsibility of its authors and their three (or more) expert reviewers,
after which those meeting Mycotaxon’s scientiﬁc and nomenclatural criteria are accepted
for posting. The author, title, and abstract of our most recently accepted web-list is provided

Ghobad-Nejhad, Masoomeh. Updated checklist of corticioid and poroid
basidiomycetes of the Caucasus region. 72 pp.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Abstract — A ﬁrst annotated checklist of corticioid and poroid basidiomycetes
of the Caucasus region was published in 2009 (Ghobad-Nejhad et al., Mycologia
Balcanica 6: 123–168, 2009). A new, updated version of the checklist is presented
and is aimed to be regularly updated at an Iranian mycological website. The list
includes 621 accepted species names with their synonym(s) used in the bibliographic
literature. Major updates include: 1) addition of substratum data for the species based
on numerous specimens examined from diﬀerent herbaria, 2) addition of literature
references, distribution data and species names not present in the earlier version,
and deletion of names conﬁrmed not to occur in the region, and 3) revision of
nomenclature and synonyms. Compared to the 2009 list, 86% of species in the current
checklist are supported by specimens examined. The aim to post the checklist in an
online version is to provide a permanent repository for keeping the list updated with
no unnecessary delay and for making the data available to the mycologists interested
in fungal diversity of the Caucasus biodiversity hotspot. New records for the region
will be published online and the users will be able to learn about the most recent
changes to the checklist via subscription to a feed (RSS). The link to the checklist is:
