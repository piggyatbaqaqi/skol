[@Abstract — New ribosomal gene analyses reveal that Entrophospora is non-monophyletic
and its type species E. infrequens closely related to Claroideoglomus species, which supports
transfer of the Entrophosporaceae from Diversisporales to Glomerales as well as the ‘ancestral’
Claroideoglomus spp. to Albahypha gen. nov. Entrophospora baltica, supported as a separate
clade within Diversisporales, is designated as type species for the new monospeciﬁc
Sacculosporaceae. Entrophospora nevadensis, phylogenetically close to Diversipora spp. and
Otospora bareae, is transferred to Tricispora gen. nov. (Diversiporaceae). Entrophospora,
Sacculospora, and Tricispora are morphologically distinguished by spore wall structure,
pattern of the two spore pore closures proximal and distal to the sporiferous saccule, and
relative spore and sporiferous saccule sizes. The shape of the white hyphae subtending the
spore base separates Albahypha spp. from Claroideoglomus spp.
Key words — otosporoid, tricisporoid, evolution, molecular phylogeny, rDNA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Entrophospora was initially characterized according to intrahyphal
spore formation within the neck of a sporiferous saccule (e.g. Ames & Schneider
1979, Błaszkowski et al. 1998, Palenzuela et al. 2010). Sieverding & Oehl (2006)#Misc-exposition*]

[@298 ... Oehl & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@have transferred three species originally placed in Entrophospora (Schenck et al.
1984, Sieverding & Toro 1985, 1987, Wu et al. 1995) to new genera as Intraspora
schenckii (Sieverd. & S. Toro) Oehl & Sieverd., Kuklospora colombiana (Spain &
N.C. Schenck) Oehl & Sieverd., and K. kentinensis (C.G. Wu & Y.S. Liu) Oehl
& Sieverd. Support for the re-classiﬁcation included i) clear morphological
diﬀerences from the type species, Entrophospora infrequens (Hall 1977; Ames &
Schneider 1979; Sieverding & Oehl 2006); ii) morphological aspects placing the
three species unequivocally in the Acaulosporaceae and Archaeosporaceae; and
iii) neither spore morphology nor genetic analysis of E. infrequens support that
species in Acaulosporaceae, where Kuklospora species phylogenetically belong
(Sieverding & Oehl 2006).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylogenetic analyses showed that the recently described E. nevadensis
belonged in Diversisporaceae (Palenzuela et al. 2010). To date Diversisporaceae
includes 13 Diversispora and six Redeckera species that form diversisporoid
spores on subtending hyphae (Oehl et al. 2011b) and one species with otosporoid
spores formed laterally on the neck of sporiferous saccules (Palenzuela et al.
2008). Another newly described species, Acaulospora colliculosa Kaonongbua
et al., was also believed to form its spores within the neck of sporiferous
saccules (Kaonongbua et al. 2010) but the illustrations rather indicate a mixture
of specimens of diﬀerent species, isolated directly from ﬁeld soil samples. Since
no saccule was presented in the latter study, further observations are needed
to conﬁrm the existence of this species, which is assumed to form pacisporoid
spores instead of kuklosporoid spores as indicated by the images.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Recent morphological and molecular analyses suggest that the genus
Entrophospora, currently comprising three species, is not monophyletic, since
E. infrequens and E. nevadensis phylogenetically belong to diﬀerent orders,
according to the recently revised Glomeromycetes (Oehl et al. 2011d). This
means that of the original species in the genus, only E. infrequens and E. baltica
(Błaszkowski et al. 1998) might remain in Entrophospora. Thus, one objective of
the current study was to analyze and re-classify Entrophospora species based on
combined morphological and phylogenetic analyses. In particular, we hoped
to resolve the confusion regarding the sequence variabilities for E. infrequens
noted by Millner et al. (2001) and Rodriguez et al. (2001). Another objective
was to conﬁrm the phylogenetic position of Otospora bareae (Palenzuela et al.
2008) within the Diversisporaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results#Misc-exposition*]
[@Molecular phylogenetic analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@The phylogenetic analyses on the nearly complete SSU of the ribosomal gene
and on partial sequences of the LSU show that E. infrequens, type species of
the Entrophosporaceae (Sieverding & Oehl 2006), is related to Claroideoglomus
species in the Glomerales (Figs 1–2). However, E. infrequens is phylogenetically
unrelated to the two other Entrophospora species that form two monophyletic
clades in the Diversisporales (Figs 1–2). Entrophospora nevadensis groups next
to O. bareae and several Diversispora species, while E. baltica groups in its own
clade, well distant from the other major clades representing families within the
Diversisporales. The phylogenetic analyses also render the genus Diversispora
paraphyletic (Figs 1–2).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphological comparisons#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the E. infrequens, E. baltica, E. nevadensis, and Otospora bareae clades
and the two Claroideoglomus clades, some morphological characters are
congruent with the phylogenetic ﬁndings. These characters are principally the
sporiferous saccule characteristics, pore closure patterns at the spore bases for
species forming spores within/on the saccule necks (Figs 3–19), and spore base
and subtending hyphae characteristics for species forming spores terminally on
hyphae (Figs 20–31).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Entrophospora infrequens forms saccules that are regularly larger than the
spores formed beneath, and the pore formed by the subtending hypha distal
to the saccules is closed by hyaline evanescent outer spore wall layers; the
next-inner structural pigmented persistent layer does not continue into the
distal part of the hyphal neck and never forms a pore distally to the saccule#Misc-exposition*]

[@spore pores are closed by a smooth, rather thin septum of the structural,
laminate wall layer, and the structural wall layer continues for a small distance
into the distal hypha of the saccule neck (Figs 8, 12, 16). In both species the
saccules are often slightly (E. baltica) or substantially (E. nevadensis) smaller
than spores formed beneath since they sometimes equal half or a quarter of
the spore diameter, respectively. Remarkably, detailed spore wall structure
analyses revealed that E. baltica has three walls (Figs 17–19), while spores of
E. nevadensis (and Otospora bareae) are clearly bi-layered (Fig. 13, and
Palenzuela et al. 2010).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Typical Claroideoglomus species (e.g., C. etunicatum, C. claroideum,
C. lamellosum (Figs 20–25), C. luteum) form hyaline subtending hyphae, which
are ‘funnel-shaped’ — their width at the spore base is regularly > 2.5 times
wider than 10–50 µm distant from the spore. However, two species that are
basal within the Claroideoglomeraceae — C. drummondii, C. walkeri (Fig. 2,
Oehl el al. 2011b)— have only slightly funnel-shaped to sometimes cylindrical
subtending hyphae that are regularly < 2.0 times broader at spore base than the
supporting hypha (Figs 26–31).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Based on our phylogenetic analyses, we propose to include the
Entrophosporaceae and its type species E. infrequens in the Glomerales. The
LSU rRNA sequence analyses indicate that Claroideoglomus should be further
divided into two genera, which is supported by the morphological diﬀerences
between the two recognized clades.#Misc-exposition*]

is indicated with it serving as type species. Entrophospora baltica, which forms

species of a new family in the order.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@New molecular and morphological analyses elucidated the molecular
phylogenetic and morphological congruencies within a group of species that
have long been considered heterogeneous (e.g. Morton & Benny 1990, Sieverding
& Oehl 2006). Species with entrophosporoid (sensu lato) spore formation
are now found within Entrophosporaceae (E. infrequens), Acaulosporaceae
(K. colombiana, K. kentinensis), Diversisporaceae (T. nevadensis), Sacculosporaceae (S. baltica), and Archaeosporaceae (Intraspora schenckii).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sequence analyses of E. infrequens, with a unique entrophosporoid spore
formation, place this species so close to Claroideoglomus that we regard#Misc-exposition*]

[@312 ... Oehl & al.#Misc-exposition*]
[@the recently described Claroideoglomeraceae as a heterotypic synonym of
Entrophosporaceae. Morphological congruencies were found to support the
phylogeny and helped identify a fourth genus, Albahypha, to include with the
type genus Entrophospora, Claroideoglomus, and Viscospora within the revised
Entrophosporaceae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The Diversisporaceae now comprise four genera: two with diversisporoid
spore formation (Diversispora and Redeckera; Oehl et al. 2011b) and one each
with otosporoid (Otospora) and tricisporoid (Tricispora) spore formation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@There are now several phylogenetic clades that form spores terminally on
hyphae as well as on or within sporiferous saccules (spore formation type
glomoid s.l., acaulosporoid s.l., entrophosporoid s.l.). These are represented
in the Entrophosporaceae (Glomerales), Diversisporaceae (Diversisporales),
and Archaeosporaceae and Ambisporaceae (Archaeosporales) clades but only
Diversisporaceae, Archaeosporaceae and Ambisporaceae are represented by all
three major spore formation types.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Further studies are still needed to determine whether the entrophosporoid
(sensu lato) genus Kuklospora is monophyletic. Most phylogenetic analyses split
the type species, K. colombiana, oﬀ at the base of Acaulosporaceae (Schüßler et
al. 2001, Palenzuela et al. 2008, 2010, Oehl et al. 2011d). Thus, we conclude that
the synonymization of Kuklospora with Acaulospora (Kaonongbua et al. 2010)
is not justiﬁed and needs to be substantiated (Oehl et al. 2011e). Moreover,
a revision of the phylogenetically and morphologically heterogeneous
Acaulosporaceae is urgently needed (Spain 1992, Oehl et al. 2011e).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Our analyses supports Tricispora nevadensis (≡ E. nevadensis) and
Otospora bareae as sister taxa within the Diversisporaceae (Figs 1–2). Both
Entrophospora and Otospora can readily be distinguished by spore formation
type, distance between the saccule terminus and the diﬀerentiated spore within
(Entrophospora) or laterally (Otospora) on the saccule neck, and the relative size
diﬀerences between saccule and spore. Morphologically, these genera have little
in common with the type genus of their family, Diversispora, whose species
form spores simply on subtending hyphae. We emphasize that there have
never been genera in Glomeromycetes (sensu Oehl et al. 2011d) that encompass
species with both glomoid and entrophosporoid or acaulosporoid spore
formation. This strongly supports the proposition of Otospora and Tricispora.#Misc-exposition*]
[@However, phylogenetically, both T. nevadensis and O. bareae render the genus
Diversispora polyphyletic.#Misc-exposition*]
[@We regard the Diversispora molecular database as still rudimentary, as the
genus comprises several species that yet to be molecularly analyzed (Oehl et al.
2011b). Additionally, the morphological diﬀerences among Diversispora clades
(Figs 1–2) are not yet clear. Before the genus Diversispora can conﬁdently be
reclassiﬁed, additional molecular and morphological studies are needed to#Misc-exposition*]

[@Albahypha, Sacculospora & Tricispora gen. nov. (Glomeromycetes) ... 313#Misc-exposition*]

[@determine relationships accurately within this heterogeneous family.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Glomus hyderabadense Swarupa et al. also deserves mention, for it regularly
forms a small terminal spore and an adjacent, subterminal large spore on
subtending hyphae. Since the terminal spore is generally much smaller than
the subterminal spore (Swarupa et al. 2004), its spore formation superﬁcially
resembles that of T. nevadensis. Although the G. hyderabadense sequence
(AY211274) aligns adjacent to G. clarum (Swarupa et al. 2004), the deposited
sequence does not represent a glomeromycotan fungus. Glomus hyderabadense
possibly forms its own clade within the Glomeromycetes and thus may represent
an undescribed fungal genus with a unique, diagnostic spore formation and
morphology.#Misc-exposition*]
