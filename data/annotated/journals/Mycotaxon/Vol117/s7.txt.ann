[@Abstract — Moelleriella pumatensis, a fungal pathogen infecting scale insect nymphs
(Hemiptera), is described and illustrated as a new species from Pu Mat National Park in
Vietnam. This species is unique in producing a golden yellow spore mass surrounding the
stroma. In surveys throughout the year in Vietnam, only the anamorphic state has been
found in the natural forest. Morphological characters and phylogenetic analysis of translation
elongation factor 1-α (tef1) reveals this species as an anamorph of Moelleriella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Moelleriella Bres. (Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Clavicipitaceae), a
fungus pathogenic to scale insects and white ﬂies, was recently segregated from
the genus Hypocrella Sacc. together with Samuelsia P. Chaverri & K.T. Hodge
(Chaverri et al. 2008). Moelleriella was described based on molecular data and
morphology: its ascospores disarticulate inside the ascus, whereas Hypocrella
and Samuelsia ascospores do not. The anamorphic state of Moelleriella
is Aschersonia-like, i.e., similar to Aschersonia sensu stricto (teleomorph
Hypocrella sensu lato; Chaverri et al. 2008). Aschersonia sensu lato species
are diﬀerentiated mostly on the shape and color of the stromata that cover
the hosts, pycnidium-like conidiomata, phialides, and presence or absence
of paraphyses. These characters have been useful in distinguishing between
subgenera of Aschersonia (Petch 1921, 1925, Mains 1959, Chaverri et al. 2008).
All species of Hypocrella, Moelleriella, and Samuelsia are pathogenic to scale
insects (Coccidae) or white ﬂies (Aleyrodidae) that feed on living leaves and
branches of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Exploration of entomopathogenic fungi in Vietnam was initiated under
the program of biodiversity studies in Southeast Asia, a collaborative project
between the Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Vinh University,
Vietnam, and the National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology
(BIOTEC), Thailand. One study site, Pu Mat National Park, is located in the
southwest of Nghe An Province, an area known to have a high diversity of
plants and mammal species. During the surveys in October 2009, an interesting
Aschersonia-like specimen that produced a yellow mass of conidia covering the
stroma was collected from the underside of a leaf of a dicotyledonous plant.
The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the taxonomic position of the
isolates derived from the anamorph state, using the sequences of translation
elongation factor 1-α (tef1), and 2) describe this specimen as a new species
from Vietnam.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Collection and Isolation#Misc-exposition*]

[@Surveys and collections were made during the rainy season in the Khe Moi trail
in Pu Mat National Park (18°46′–19°12′N 104°24′–104°56′E). Material was examined
and isolated into pure culture from the anamorphic state following Mongkolsamrit et al
(2009). Free-hand longitudinal sections of tissues and conidia were mounted in cotton
blue in lactophenol (Heritage et al. 1996) and measured using a light microscope. The
color of fresh specimens and cultures were compared with the colors from standard
code from Kornerup & Wanscher (1962). Specimens were identiﬁed using specialized
literature (Petch 1921, Mains 1959, Chaverri et al. 2008). A voucher specimen and
culture were deposited in BIOTEC Bangkok Herbarium (BBH) and BIOTEC Culture
Collection, Thailand.#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA extraction, ampliﬁcation and sequencing#Misc-exposition*]

[@Small pieces of tissue (2–3 mm) of each sample were taken from potato-dextroseagar (PDA) plates and placed in 50 ml of potato-dextrose-broth (PDB) in a 250 ml
ﬂask. Flasks were incubated in a shaker at 200 rpm for 15–20 d at 20°C in dark. The
mycelial mass was harvested by ﬁltration (Whatman No.1), washed with sterile distilled
water, lyophilized for 1 d, and crushed in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total
DNA of each sample was extracted using Cetyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (CTAB)
following the procedure described in Mackill & Bonman (1995). PCR ampliﬁcation
was done in 50 µl volume consisting of 1× PCR buﬀer, 200 µM of each of the four
dNTPs, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and
0.5 µM of each primer. The primers for tef1 were 983f (Carbone & Kohn 1999) and
2218r (Rehner 2001). Ampliﬁcations were performed using a MJ Research DNA Engine
ALD1244 thermal cycler following the procedure described in Sung et al. (2001). PCR
products were puriﬁed using a QIAquick PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden,
Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Puriﬁed PCR products were sent
to Macrogen Inc. Korea for sequencing.#Misc-exposition*]

Phylogenetic analysis
#Table*]
[@Sequences were proofed manually, assembled using BioEdit v. 6.0.7 (Hall 2004), and
submitted to Genbank (Table 1). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW incorporated
in BioEdit and alignments were reﬁned manually by direct examination. Maximum
parsimony analysis was performed using random addition sequence (10 replications)
and gaps were treated as missing data. Bootstrap analysis was performed using maximum
parsimony criterion in 1000 replication samples.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

[@Molecular analysis#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ampliﬁcation and sequencing of tef1 were successful for 16 strains comprising
two unidentiﬁed Aschersonia-like specimens. Fourteen selected closely related
taxa were obtained from GenBank for this study. Sequences of Epichloe elymi
and Balansia henningsiana were used as outgroup taxa. Of the 899-character
alignment in the tef1 data set, 188 characters were parsimony informative.
Maximum parsimony analyses of this data set yielded one parsimonious tree
(tree length 436; CI = 0.651, RI = 0.795, RC = 0.518, HI = 0.349) as shown in
Fig 1. The phylogenic tree suggests that the two anamorphic isolates with yellow
conidial masses (BCC41004 and BCC41006) belong to the genus Moelleriella
with a strong bootstrap support of 99%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments: A teleomorphic state of this species was not found in the ﬁeld
although several attempts to ﬁnd it were made throughout the year. However,
the teleomorph name is used for this new species because both phylogenetic
analysis and morphology support the placement of this species in Moelleriella.
In this case, as well as for Moelleriella madidiensis from Bolivia also with only
an anamorphic state, the teleomorphic name is used (Chaverri et al. 2008).
The anamorphic state of M. pumatensis is similar to Aschersonia aleyrodis
(teleomorph: M. libera) reported from Brazil, Florida, and Venezuela by
Petch (1921) based on pulvinate stroma, yellow mass of extruded spores, and
fusiform conidia. The conidia and paraphyses of M. pumatensis are somewhat
longer; the conidia are 12–15 × 2–2.5 μm and paraphyses up to 180 μm long.
In contrast, A. aleyrodis has conidia 8–14 × 1.5–2 μm, paraphyses 50–110 μm
long. In addition, M. pumatensis was compared morphologically with several
species collected from the Neotropics (Chaverri et al. 2008), China (Qiu et al.
2009, Qiu & Guan 2010), and Thailand (Luangsa-ard et al. 2007, 2008, 2010,
Mongkolsamrit et al. 2009). The Vietnamese specimens are mostly similar
to Aschersonia andropogonis (teleomorph: M. ochracea) in having pulvinate
stroma, yellow, yellowish orange to orange spore masses, fusiform conidia
(8–14 × 1.5–2 μm), which is commonly found in the Neotropics. However, M.
pumatensis diﬀers from A. andropogonis in the color of the stroma. Moelleriella
pumatensis has a golden yellow stroma while that of A. andropogonis is white
to pale yellow. The DNA sequence analysis of translation elongation factor 1-α
(tef1) also supports M. pumatensis as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]
