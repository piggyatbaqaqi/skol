Abstract — A new species, Phylloporus fagicola, has been discovered growing in association
with two relict populations of Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana in the subtropical region of
central Veracruz (eastern Mexico). The species belongs to a taxonomic group characterized
by broadly ellipsoid oblong to ovoid basidiospores, distinct from the subfusoid boletoid type.
The new taxon is described, illustrated, and compared with closely similar species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Currently, Phylloporus rhodoxanthus (Schwein.) Bres., P. bellus (Massee)
Corner, P. phaeoxanthus var. simplex Singer & L.D. Gómez, P. foliiporus (Murrill)
Singer, P. centroamericanus Singer & L.D. Gómez, and P. guzmanii Montoya &
Bandala have been recorded from Mexico (Singer 1957, Singer 1978, Singer &
Gómez 1984, Montoya et al. 1987, Montoya & Bandala 1991). Those records
represent a low proportion of the 24 Phylloporus taxa known to occur in the
Neotropics (Neves & Halling 2010). A new species described here, P. guzmanii
from Mexico, and P. aurantiacus Halling & G.M. Muell. from Costa Rica (Halling
et al. 1999), form a group of American taxa distinguished by broadly ellipsoid,
oblong, or ovoid shaped basidiospores that diﬀer from the boletoid (subfusoid)
basidiospores typical of other Phylloporus species (Corner 1970, Heinemann
& Rammeloo 1987, Neves & Halling 2010). The Phylloporus species previously
reported from Mexico have been recorded growing with Quercus or Pinus. The
new species described here represents the ﬁrst Mexican record of a Phylloporus
growing in association with Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana (Martínez) Little.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Between September 2005 and September 2009 in the State of Veracruz, random
surveys were conducted in two Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana stands in Mesa de la#Misc-exposition*]

Macromorphological characters were recorded from fresh sporocarps. Alphanumeric
color codes refer to Kornerup & Wanscher (1967) and Munsell (1994) (e.g. 2.5Y 5/2).
Micromorphological features were recorded in 3% potassium hydroxide water solution.
Basidiospore measurements were determined according to Montoya & Bandala (2003),
with 45–50 spores measured per collection and where Xm = length × width range of
means and Qm = the mean length/width ratio for n collections. Line drawings were made
with the aid of a drawing tube. The examined specimens studied are now deposited in
XAL herbarium. Acronyms for the herbaria follow Holmgren & Holmgren (1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylloporus fagicola is distinguished by the following features: a short,
medium-sized basidiome, brightly colored (red-orange with yellow tones with
egg-yellow to orange-yellow lamellae) but with context and surfaces bruising
blue, crowded lamellae, thick-walled cystidia, and pileipellis at ﬁrst a cutis and
developing frequent mounds of anticlinal chains of elements when mature.
Among other Phylloporus taxa with ellipsoid to oblong basidiospores,
P. guzmanii is distinguished by a vinaceous-red to dark purple pileus and stipe,
gills that are more distant and lighter yellow, slightly narrower basidiospores
[(6.4–)7.2–8.8(–10.4) × (3.2–)4.0–4.8(–5.6) µm], thin-walled and somewhat
shorter cystidia [pleurocystidia (41.6–)45.0–105.6(–116.8) × 5.6–11.0(–12.0)
µm; cheilocystidia 72.0–80.4 × 6.4–11.2 µm], and a trichodermial pileipellis
with larger terminal elements [(20–)22–78(–80) × 5.5–10 µm]. Phylloporus
guzmanii was recorded from Central and SW Mexico, growing in mesophytic
Quercus and Pinus forests (Montoya & Bandala 1991).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylloporus aurantiacus, which possesses oblong basidiospores that are
shorter (5.6–7.7 × 3.5–5 µm, Xm = 6.8 × 3.5 µm) and more ovoid in shape, is also
distinguished by unchanging ﬂesh when exposed, lamellae lacking red stains,
shorter (60–90 × 7–10 µm) thin-walled cystidia, a trichodermial pileipellis, and
an association with Quercus (Halling et al. 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Phylloporus coccineus Corner from Singapore, also with broadly ellipsoid
basidiospores that are somewhat shorter [7.5–9(–10) × 6.5–7.5(–8) µm] and
more globose, diﬀers from P. fagicola in subdistant gills, thin-walled larger
cystidia [pleurocystidia 200 × 10–16 µm; cheilocystidia 70–120 × 10–18 µm],
and a pileipellis comprising a compact palisade of terminal elements (25–40 ×
5–10 µm) with reddish-orange sap and slightly thickened pink walls (Corner
1970).#Misc-exposition*]
[@During repeated surveys of both sites, the P. fagicola specimens fruited
infrequently compared with other species recorded in the area. The new species
appears to associate with Fagus grandifolia var. mexicana and has not yet been
found in other montane cloud forest fragments of surrounding the area or in
other regions explored by us.#Misc-exposition*]
