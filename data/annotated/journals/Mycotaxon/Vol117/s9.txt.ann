Abstract — Four species collected from plant debris in natural areas of southern China
are recorded for the ﬁrst time from China. Digitoramispora caribensis, D. tambdisurlensis,
D. excentrica, and D. lageniformis are described and illustrated, and a key to currently accepted
Digitoramispora species is provided. The specimens are deposited in Herbarium of Shandong
Agricultural University, Plant Pathology (HSAUP), and Mycological Herbarium, Institute of
Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (HMAS).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Castañeda & Kendrick (1990) introduced Digitoramispora to accommodate
two species, D. caribensis (type species) and D. excentrica. Two other species,
D. lageniformis and D. tambdisurlensis were described from Thailand and
India, respectively (Somrithipol & Jones 2003, Pratibha et al. 2009). Until now,
Digitoramispora has contained only these four species with no reports from
China. Digitoramispora species produce dictyosporous, digitate or irregular
conidia with peripheral hyaline or colourless short radiating branches or cells,
and irregularly (often percurrently) extending conidiophores (Castañeda &
Kendrick 1990). During investigations of tropical fungi from the forests of
southern China, all four species of Digitoramispora were collected. They are
illustrated and described as new records for China.#Misc-exposition*]

was previously known only from Cuba. Our specimen is similar to the type
species, but it lacks annellidic conidiogenous cells and its conidia are somewhat

[@Comments—Digitoramispora tambdisurlensis diﬀers from the other three
species in the genus by its larger conidia and conidiophores. The shape and size
of the conidia in our collection compare well with those described by Pratibha
et al. (2009). The only diﬀerence is that the conidia and conidiophores in our
collection are slightly smaller.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments—Digitoramispora excentrica was originally described as Acrodictys
excentrica by Sutton (1969) in Canada. Hughes (1979) transferred it to
Arachnophora (as A. excentrica (B. Sutton) S. Hughes) based on the rhexolytic
conidial secession. Castañeda & Kendrick (1990) provided the combination
