[@ABSTRACT-Amanita
conara, A. costaricensis, and A. garabitoana are proposed as new
species. These taxa are added to twelve previously described species known from, or
reported here for the first time from, the region of study: A. advena, A. arocheae, A.
brunneolocularis, A. colombiana, A. ebumea, A. farinosa, A. flavoconia var. inquinata,
A. fuligineodisca, A. muscaria subsp. flavivolvata, A. polypyramis, A. sororcula, and A.
xylinivolva. Amanita flavoconia var. sinapicolor is proposed to be a taxonomic synonym
of A. flavoconia var. inquinata. An unusual species of Amanita subsection Vittadiniae is
given the code Amanita sp. HONI and treated only in a key to regional species of Amanita section Lepidella. A gazetteer is provided for Costa Rican sites at which Amanita
species have been collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita sect. Amanita (three taxa):#Misc-exposition*]
[@• A. farinosa Schwein. - Costa Rica is the known southern limit of distribution. It was described from North Carolina, USA; the range of this
mushroom extends northward into Provo Quebec, Canada (Pomerleau
1980) .#Misc-exposition*]
[@• A. muscaria subsp. flavivolvata Singer - originally described from ca.
San Francisco, California, USA, this species now is known to have a
range extending north into the Alaskan panhandle and eastward across
Canada and the northern United States to Newfoundland in the north
and extending southward at least to Costa Rica. In the southeastern
U.S. its distribution is unclear due to confusion with A. muscaria var.
persicina Dav. T. Jenkins (Jenkins 1977, 1986), which is endemic in
that region. In North America, a yellow-capped color-variant of subsp.
flavivolvata dominates in most of that part of the region of distribution
north and east of the Great Plains. The typical, red-capped color-variant dominates throughout the remainder of the range. In the neovolcanic region of Mexico, the subspecies is relatively common in mixed
montane forest; and is associated with Quercus in Costa Rica. If not
native in Colombia, it has been introduced there with Pinus or Quercus
from more northerly latitudes. The taxon is often misreported throughout its range as the type subspecies or type variety of A. muscaria (L. :
Fr.) Lam.(Tulloss 2009c; Geml et al. 2008).#Misc-exposition*]

[@light at higher altitudes resulting in some desiccation and alteration of
pigment. As has been observed in other taxa of Amanita (e.g., Tulloss
& Borgen 1996; Tanghe & Hillhouse 1973), the desiccation also results
in production of smaller and more nearly globose spores. As previously observed, (Tulloss et al. 1992), there is a strong statistical correlation between cap color and spore shape; but we now believe this was
wrongly interpreted as genetically determined by the authors of the
pale variety. Therefore, we propose reducingA.jlavoconia
var. sinapicolor to synonymy with var. inquinata.#Misc-exposition*]

habit and in size and shape of spores is A. arkansana the known range of
which lies within the southeastern United States (Arkansas to the Gulf Coast

in at least the following:
• Pigmentation: The North American species lacks olivaceous tints in the

arkansana are concolorous with the stipe (yellow) at first and become
deeper yellow or more orange from handling; they are never olivaceous

[@So far as is known (C. Bas pers. corresp.; Tulloss unpub. data), it is not
unusual to find vascular hyphae especially plentiful in the pileus context
above the stipe in Amanita. This is an item worthy of further study. Bas
(1969 and pers. corresp.) has noted that vascular hyphae are sometimes concentrated in damaged areas in Amanita. Since they arise from filamentous
undifferentiated hyphae (Tulloss unpub. data), it may be the case that they are
produced in response to damage or in areas of mechanical stress (such as the
stipe-pileus convergence region). One hypothesis might be that the (partially?) insoluble material often seen when a vascular hypha is cut or broken
during sectioning may include an antibiotic or some other aid to maintaining
the integrity of the basidiome and, hence, reproduction of the species.
We also wish to make it clear that we make no claim for novelty with regard to
the arrangement of acrophysalides in the center of the pileus. However, it
does seem of interest to examine (in the future) the mechanical structure(s) by
which the joining of the stipe and cap takes place in Amanita.
Mueller 4501 was immature when dried; in measuring spores from a single
mount, three 5-sterigmate basidia were noted with the sterigmata bearing content-less, wand-like or very narrowly clavate spores. The single basidiome of
this collection is considered by us to be bearing abnormal spores.

[@COMMENTS - Four taxa have been assigned to Amanita subsect. Gymnopodae
world wide, but all can be easily distinguished from the present species. In
addition to their general habit, three of these species have in common with A.
conara a number of distinctive characters among which are rubescent or dark-#Misc-exposition*]

[@ening context, a distinctive odor, yellow or orange tints on the lamellae, and a
submembranous surface layer of the universal veil.
• Amanita gymnopus Comer & Bas (Comer & Bas 1962), described from
Malaysian "jungle" and reported from southern China (Chen et al.
2001, Yang 2005) and Japan (Hongo 1982), has small (5-7 x 5-6.5 µm
per Comer and Bas), globose to subglobose spores; a universal veil that
forms submembranous patches and not warts on the pileus; and marked
rhizoids attached to the stipe base (Bas 1969: fig. 378). Chen et al.
reported spores of 6.0-7.5 (-8.0) x (5.0-) 5.5-6.5 µm from a single
specimen. Yang reported spore data as follows in specimens from at
least three localities: 6.0-8.5 x (5.0-) 5.5-7.5 µm, (Q = (1.03-) 1.071.24 (-1.42); Q = 1.14 ± 0.08).1
• Amanita ochraceobulbosa A. E. Wood (Wood 1997) has subglobose to
broadly ellipsoid spores 9.3-11.7 x (7.3-) 8.1-9.6 (-10.2) µm with est.
Q = 1.2, a cap that is cream to cream-buff to yellow-orange-cream with
universal veil remains as (often large) pyramidal warts, gills that are
white to cream, flesh that apparently is nonstaining when cut or
bruised, and pyramidal warts sometimes present on the stipe's basal
bulb. Absence of a submembranous outer volval layer, presence of
warts on the bulb, and no mention of staining flesh or distinctive odor
suggest that this taxon is not appropriately placed in subsect. Gymnopodae.
• Amanita ochrophylla (Cooke & Massee) Cleland (Cleland 1924),
described from edges of open forest in eastern and southeastern Australia (Bas 1969: 556), has larger, proportionately narrower spores (9-11 x
5.5-7 µm) with Q = 1.3-2.0 and Q = 1.5-1.8; a limbus internus that is
apparently more coherent than that of A. conara and is frequently left
as a "second annulus" on the stipe just below the partial veil (Bas 1969:
fig. 374); flesh that becomes pink on exposure; etc. Wood (1997: 803)
gives spore measurements as follows: 9.3-10.8 (-12.6) x 5.4-7.4
(-8.4) µm, with Q = 1.43-1.72 (-1.88). We estimate Q' for Wood's
material as 1.55-1.6.
• Amanita ochrophylloides D. A. Reid (Reid 1978, 1980), described from
"under Eucalyptus sp. (of peppermint group)" in the state of Victoria,
Australia, has predominantly subglobose to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid spores (7.0-10.0 x 5.0-8.0 µm, with est. Q = 1.3); a pale brown
pileus with dark, "strobiliform" warts; a tendency to darken from
handling; pale golden yellow lamellae; a slight volval limb on the#Misc-exposition*]

Guzman (1975) reportedA. ochrophylla from Quercus forest in Guerrero. His
macroscopic description fits A. conara rather well; and his measurements for
spores are 9-11 x (5.5-) 6.0-7.5 µm. This is a relatively good match for our
spore data fromA. conara. We estimate a Q' of approximately 1.5 for spores
of Guzman's material. We have not yet reviewed the material Guzman cited,
but it appears to us that A. conara may occur in Mexico.
Mueller 4643 consists of a single, rather large, immature specimen of A.
conara. It comes from the same habit as the other material cited and is easily
recognizable because of excellent photographs and notes on fresh material
that accompany the exsiccatum; moreover, the thin membranous outer layer of
the universal veil can be seen on scalp sections of the universal veil remnants
on the pileus.#Misc-exposition*]

COMMENTS- This species was described in the notebooks ofthe late Dr. Rolf
Singer under his herbarium name "costaricensis."
Since he originated the
name and had a clear concept of its application and since we utilize collections annotated by him, we have included Dr. Singer as an author of the species.
According to the descriptions and keys of Bas (1969), A. costaricensis fits
well within his stirps Microlepis of Amanita [sect. Lepidella] subsect. Solitariae Bas. Within this stirps, the present species is strikingly similar to A. atkinsoniana Coker (Coker 1917) andA. onusta (Howe) Sacco (Saccardo 1891).
Amanita atkinsoniana (Tulloss 2011d) is moderately common in a range
extending from southern Provo Quebec, Canada (Pomerleau 1980) to Michoacan edo., Mexico. Amanita atkinsoniana can be distinguished from the present species by

[@In two cases [Halling 7667 (NY; USJ) and Tulloss 6-21-95-E (RET 337-3;
USJ)], an amanita assignable to Amanita subgenus Lepidella (sect. Validae or
sect. Lepidella) was misdetermined in the field as A. costaricensis. The undetermined species has a gray stipe that is stuffed (becoming hollow), gray
underside and margin to the membranous annulus, gray warts on the graybrown to pale gray pileus, and short basidia [19-34 (--44) µm long] apparently
lacking clamps. The species is somewhat unusual for sect. Validae because of
its unpleasant smell (sometimes like the smell of disinfectant cleaning solution in hospitals). The misdetermined entity should be distinguishable by the
lack of a radicating bulb, the absence of basidial clamps, and by its smaller
and more nearly globose spores: [33/2/2] (7.3-) 7.5-9.0 (-10.0) x (6.5-) 7.08.0 (-9.1) µm, (L = 8.2 µm; L' = 8.2 µm; W = 7.5 µm; W' = 7.5 µm; Q =
(1.04-) 1.05-1.14 (-1.23); Q = 1.09-1.11; Q' = 1.09). Especially, considering
the apparently parasitized collections of A. costaricensis discussed below, we
had some hesitation concerning whether or not Halling 7667 and Tulloss
6-21-95-E also comprised parasitized material. However, we are convinced
that they represent a distinct species because (1) the spores of these two collections were both shorter (on average) and broader (on average) than those of
A. costaricensis [Compare values of L' and W'. Reduction in spore volume
due to stress would have reduced both length and width.]; (2) both exhibited a
membranous annulus; and (3) both apparently lack basidial clamps. Basidia
predominantly less than 30 µm long, might support assignment to sect. Validae, but further study is required.
In one case {Estrella, 14.vi.1996 RE. Halling & J. Ammirati [Halling 7684]
(NY; USJ)}, all the specimens of a rather large collection apparently assignable to A. costaricensis had an odor like pig manure. In addition, some had
rather distorted stipes; and the spores of all collections were uniformly smaller#Misc-exposition*]

[@198...Tulloss, Halling & Mueller#Page-header*]

[@than normal ([100/5/1] (7.2-) 7.6-9.5 (-11.0) x (5.3-) 5.5-7.3 (-8.0) µm, (L =
8.3-9.0 µm; L' = 8.7 µm; W = 6.2-6.6 µm; W' = 6.4 µm; Q = (1.18-) 1.231.50 (-1.80); Q = 1.30-1.45; Q' = 1.37). Observed at 1250x, many of the
spores were surrounded with small, hyaline, colorless, inamyloid spheres (1±3± µm diam.) connected to the spore walls by what appeared to be fme
tubules-the
whole having the appearance of a pincushion. We hypothesize
that the noted alterations in morphology and odor are a result of "parasitization." The authors explicitly exclude Halling 7684 from the set of para types.
In another case of apparent parasitization (San Gerardo de Dota no. 4,
24.vii.1992 B.A. Strack, J. Polishook, L.D. Gomez, G. Hewson & G.M. Mueller [Mueller 4368] (F 1102421)), spores, basidia, and lamella trama were quite
normal for the species; however, the context of both the pileus and stipe
stained yellow when cut. Two other pigment-related characters were unusual
for A. costaricensis as we understand it: universal veil renmants on pileus,
stipe, and bulb of stipe were paler than usual and remained paler than the
pileus disc despite becoming brown with time, even in a mature specimen;
and the pileus disc was darker than usual. Further, lamellulae were reported to
all be very short; and the basidiomes were said to have had an unusual musty
odor. The yellow staining is very similar to that seen in apparently parasitized
specimens of A. subsolitaria (Murrill) Murrill from the Atlantic coastal plain
of the USA (Tulloss 1998b; 2000a: 57, fig. 5; Tulloss 20 11c). In the latter
case, basidiomes are sometimes found that not only stain bright yellow when
cut, but release an orange-amber liquid from wounds. Spores of such specimens are often, but not always, subnormal in size and distorted in shape--the
same yellowing phenomenon may be seen in specimens with spores nearly, or
quite, normal with regard to size and shape. The provisional name of Bas
(1969), A. "crassifolia," was put forward for yellowing material that Bas
thought might be determinable as A. subsolitaria; Tulloss is now convinced
this is the case.#Misc-exposition*]
[@It should be noted that two North American taxa assignable to sect. Lepidella
have been described by Bas (1969) because of their pronounced ability to
become bright yellow or yellow-orange when cut (A. cinereoconia var. croceescens Bas and A. rhoadsii var.jlavotingens Bas). Tulloss (1998b, 2000a)
questioned whether these entities might not be based on parasitized specimens
of the respective species. It would be interesting to see what information
about Amanita parasites might be determined from study of fresh material of
Costa Rican cases of apparent parasitization such as those presented above. If
the species with yellowing context reaction in sect. Lepidella may be grouped
together and the yellowing attributed to a single cause, or a set of common
causes, then A. costaricensis becomes the first representative of this group in#Misc-exposition*]
