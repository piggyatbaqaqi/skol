[@Abstract —The anamorphic fungus Tandonella wangii is recombined as Passalora wangii.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The species was originally collected on leaves of Ligularia sp. during a taxonomic survey
carried out in Motianling, Inner Mongolia, China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Key words — hyphomycete, imperfect fungi, taxonomy#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tandonella S.S. Prasad & R.A.B. Verma (Prasad & Verma 1970) was one of the
anamorph genera for Mycosphaerella, usually plant pathogenic, symptomless or
almost so but also often causing leaf lesions. Diﬀerentiating between Passalora
and Tandonella, which comprised taxa with superﬁcial secondary mycelium,
synnematous conidiophores, and catenate conidia, was diﬃcult.#Misc-exposition*]
[@When Crous & Braun (2003: 19–22) emended the circumscription of
Passalora, they reduced Tandonella to a synonym of Passalora, which otherwise
diﬀered from Tandonella by the formation of solitary conidia and the absence
of superﬁcial mycelium and synnematous conidiophores. The emended
Passalora embraces a wide morphological variation with secondary mycelium
that is absent or well developed, external, and superﬁcial, conidiophores that
are solitary, fasciculate, or in sporodochial to synnematous conidiomata, and
conidia that range from solitary to catenate and in simple or branched chains.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Because Tandonella is no longer tenable as a separate genus, we here transfer
the previously reported species, T. wangii (Zhai et al. 2006), to Passalora.#Misc-exposition*]
