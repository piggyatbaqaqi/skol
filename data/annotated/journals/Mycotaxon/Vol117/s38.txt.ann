[@Abstract —A new Terriera species, T. huangshanensis on leaves of Eurya muricata var. huiana,
is described. The species is placed in Terriera based on the presence of strongly carbonized
extensions adjacent to the ascoma opening, somewhat thin-walled cells at the marginal parts
of the ascoma composed of colorless to light brown textura angularis-prismatica, and the
absence of lip cells. The new species is similar to T. minor, which is distinguished by smaller
ascomata with rounded ends, textura prismatica in the corner between the covering and basal
stroma, paraphyses branching 2−3 times in the apical 30−40µm, sequentially ripening asci,
and ascospores tapering towards the ends. The type specimen is deposited in the Herbarium
of Forest Fungi of Anhui Agricultural University, China (AAUF).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terriera B. Erikss. is a member of Rhytismataceae (Rhytismatales,
Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota) (Kirk et al. 2008). Since Eriksson (1970) established
Terriera as a new genus for T. cladophila (Lév.) B. Erikss., 17 species and 2 varieties
have been reported. Terriera species are distributed worldwide and associate
with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In the past, members of this genus
were placed in Lophodermium Chevall., Hypoderma De Not., Clithris (Fr.)
Bonord., and Dermascia Tehon (Johnston, 2001). Although the classiﬁcations
of Höhnel (1917) and Tehon (1935), based heavily on developmental
characteristics of the ascomatal primordium, have been criticized and rejected
by later researchers, they appear highly signiﬁcant for recognizing Terriera as
phylogenetically distinct from the highly heterogeneous Lophodermium s. lat.
(Lantz et al. 2011). Ortiz-García et al. (2003) noted that ‘Terriera minor diﬀers
from Lophodermium in structure of the ascomatal primordium.’ Johnston
(2001) emphasized the importance of characters such as ascus and ascospore
size, apical shape of the ascus and paraphysis, and features of the conidiomata#Misc-exposition*]

[@in his taxonomy of Terriera. Therefore in Johnston (2001) and Ortiz-García et
al. (2003), he accepted into the genus several species with a typically Terrieralike ascoma such as Clithris arundinacea Penz. & Sacc., Hypoderma fuegianum
(Speg.) Kuntze, Lophodermium javanicum Penz. & Sacc., and L. sacchari Lyon.
Ortiz-García et al. (2003) attempted to explain phylogenetic relationships
within Lophodermium by rDNA-ITS sequence analyses of Lophodermium
species and representatives of other rhytismataceous genera. The results
showed that Lophodermium from pine hosts formed an independent clade
with Meloderma Darker and Elytroderma Darker but were distally related to
Terriera. A more comprehensive survey by Lantz et al. (2011) indicated that
Terriera is monophyletic, while Lophodermium as currently circumscribed
contains as many as 10 independently evolved species clusters.#Misc-exposition*]
[@For China, only one species of Terriera, T. brevis (Berk.) P.R. Johnst., was
reported in Hong Kong (Fröhlich & Hyde 2000). In the present paper we
describe a new Terriera species from the Huangshan Mountains in Anhui
Province, China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Mature fruit bodies were selected from the collected specimen. External shapes,
size, color and opening ways of ascomata and conidiomata as well as zone line were
observed under the dissecting microscope. Materials were then rehydrated in water for
15min, after which 10−15 µm thick fruitbody sections were cut by a freezing microtome
and mounted in lactic acid or cotton blue with water pretreatment for viewing outlines
of ascomata and conidiomata in vertical section. Gelatinous sheaths surrounding
ascospores and paraphyses were examined in water or 0.1% (w/v) cotton blue in lactic
acid. Color of diversiﬁed structures and ascospore contents were observed in water.
Measurements and drawings were made using materials mounted in 5% KOH and
from 30 asci, ascospores, and paraphyses for each specimen. Line and point integrated
illustrations of internal structures of fruit bodies were drawn using the microscopic
painting device (Panasoianic XSJ-2). The type specimen is deposited in the Herbarium
of Forest Fungi of Anhui Agricultural University, China (AAUF).#Misc-exposition*]

[@or subfusiform, straight or curved (lunate), sometimes 3-lobed or triangular,
ends rounded to subacute, strongly raised above the surface of the substrate
at maturity, opening by a single longitudinal split which is branched in the
triangular ascomata. Lips absent, split extending almost the whole length of
the ascoma. Entirety of ascomata black, matt or slightly glossy, the edge well
deﬁned. In median vertical section, ascomata subepidermal with epidermal
cells becoming ﬁlled with fungal tissue as ascomata develops, 175−205 µm
deep. Covering stroma 18−22 μm thick near the centre of the ascoma, slightly
thicker towards the edges, extending to the basal stroma, consisting of dark
brown to light black, thick-walled textura angularis and textura globulosa with
cells 3.5−5.5 µm diam. Along the edge of the ascoma opening there is a 12−20
µm thick extension adjacent to the covering stroma which covers the hymenium,
and which is comprised of strongly carbonized tissue with no obvious cellular
structure. Excipulum very poorly developed, closely adhering to sides of the
extension and the covering stroma. Basal stroma 10−18 µm thick, dark
brown, consisting of 2−4 rows of 4−7 µm diam., angular, thick-walled cells.
Subhymenium 15−25 µm thick, composed of hyaline textura angularis and
textura porrecta, with a colorless to gray-brown, 12 −30 µm thick, of textura
angularis mixed with textura prismatica at the edge of the ascoma. Hymenium
often extending beyond the top of the extension when ripening. Paraphyses
120−140 × 1−1.2 µm, ﬁliform, thin-walled, hyaline, branching 1−2 times and
slightly swollen at the apex, with a ca 1 μm thick gelatinous matrix, forming
a distinct epithecium above the asci. Asci ripening synchronously, 100−120 ×
5−7 µm, narrow-cylindrical, thin-walled and equal, apex rounded or subacute,
not bluing in iodine, discharging spores through a small apical hole, 8-spored,
stalk 15−28 µm in length. Ascospores borne in a fascicle, sometimes helically
arranged, 58−90 × 1.5−2 µm, ﬁliform, slightly tapered towards the base, hyaline,
aseptate, thin-walled, covered by a 1−1.5 µm thick gelatinous sheath.
Conidiomata on both sides of leaves, predominantly on the upper side,
scattered to crowded, sometimes coalescing. In surface view, conidiomata
75−130 × 70−90 µm, round to elliptical, raising the leaf surface, lightly brown
but dark brown, grey-brown or dark brown in the regions of the edge and
the surrounding of apical ostiole after discharging spores. In vertical section,
conidiomata subcuticular, somewhat lenticular in outline, 50−65 µm deep.
Upper wall poorly developed, only present in surrounding of the ostiole. Basal
wall well-developed, 6−8.5 μm, dark brown, consisting of 2−3 rows of 2−3.5
µm diam., angular, slightly thick-walled cells. Subconidiogenous layer ca 8
µm thick, composed of very light, thin-walled, angular cells. Conidiogenous
cells 8−12 × 2−3 μm, cylindrical, slightly tapered towards the apex, hyaline,
proliferating sympodially. Conidia 4.5−6 × ca 1 μm, cylindrical, hyaline,
aseptate.#Description*]

[@Terriera huangshanensis sp. nov. (China) ... 371#Page-header*]

[@Comments —Terriera huangshanensis is distinctive within the genus because
of the synchronously ripening asci and the hymenium that often overtops the
extension of the covering stroma when mature. The most widely distributed
species, T. minor (Tehon) P.R. Johnst., is similar but diﬀers in many aspects: its
ascomata have rounded ends and are not associated with conidiomata and zone
lines, the textura prismatica between the covering and basal stroma is poorly
developed, asci ripen sequentially, and the ascospores are 0−1 septate and
taper slightly towards both ends (Johnston 1988, 1989a, b). The type species
T. cladophila is distinguished from T. huangshanensis by subcuticular, circular
to elliptical, non-curved ascomata that are associated with brown diﬀuse zone
lines; the textura prismatica between the covering and basal stroma composed
of vertically oriented cells; sequentially ripening asci; and a subhymenium
consisting of textura angularis and textura intricata (Minter 1996).#Misc-exposition*]
