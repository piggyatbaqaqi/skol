[@Abstract —A new Terriera species, T. huangshanensis on leaves of Eurya muricata var. huiana,
is described. The species is placed in Terriera based on the presence of strongly carbonized
extensions adjacent to the ascoma opening, somewhat thin-walled cells at the marginal parts
of the ascoma composed of colorless to light brown textura angularis-prismatica, and the
absence of lip cells. The new species is similar to T. minor, which is distinguished by smaller
ascomata with rounded ends, textura prismatica in the corner between the covering and basal
stroma, paraphyses branching 2−3 times in the apical 30−40µm, sequentially ripening asci,
and ascospores tapering towards the ends. The type specimen is deposited in the Herbarium
of Forest Fungi of Anhui Agricultural University, China (AAUF).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terriera B. Erikss. is a member of Rhytismataceae (Rhytismatales,
Leotiomycetes, Ascomycota) (Kirk et al. 2008). Since Eriksson (1970) established
Terriera as a new genus for T. cladophila (Lév.) B. Erikss., 17 species and 2 varieties
have been reported. Terriera species are distributed worldwide and associate
with both angiosperms and gymnosperms. In the past, members of this genus
were placed in Lophodermium Chevall., Hypoderma De Not., Clithris (Fr.)
Bonord., and Dermascia Tehon (Johnston, 2001). Although the classiﬁcations
of Höhnel (1917) and Tehon (1935), based heavily on developmental
characteristics of the ascomatal primordium, have been criticized and rejected
by later researchers, they appear highly signiﬁcant for recognizing Terriera as
phylogenetically distinct from the highly heterogeneous Lophodermium s. lat.
(Lantz et al. 2011). Ortiz-García et al. (2003) noted that ‘Terriera minor diﬀers
from Lophodermium in structure of the ascomatal primordium.’ Johnston
(2001) emphasized the importance of characters such as ascus and ascospore
size, apical shape of the ascus and paraphysis, and features of the conidiomata#Misc-exposition*]

[@in his taxonomy of Terriera. Therefore in Johnston (2001) and Ortiz-García et
al. (2003), he accepted into the genus several species with a typically Terrieralike ascoma such as Clithris arundinacea Penz. & Sacc., Hypoderma fuegianum
(Speg.) Kuntze, Lophodermium javanicum Penz. & Sacc., and L. sacchari Lyon.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Ortiz-García et al. (2003) attempted to explain phylogenetic relationships
within Lophodermium by rDNA-ITS sequence analyses of Lophodermium
species and representatives of other rhytismataceous genera. The results
showed that Lophodermium from pine hosts formed an independent clade
with Meloderma Darker and Elytroderma Darker but were distally related to
Terriera. A more comprehensive survey by Lantz et al. (2011) indicated that
Terriera is monophyletic, while Lophodermium as currently circumscribed
contains as many as 10 independently evolved species clusters.#Misc-exposition*]
[@For China, only one species of Terriera, T. brevis (Berk.) P.R. Johnst., was
reported in Hong Kong (Fröhlich & Hyde 2000). In the present paper we
describe a new Terriera species from the Huangshan Mountains in Anhui
Province, China.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Mature fruit bodies were selected from the collected specimen. External shapes,
size, color and opening ways of ascomata and conidiomata as well as zone line were
observed under the dissecting microscope. Materials were then rehydrated in water for
15min, after which 10−15 µm thick fruitbody sections were cut by a freezing microtome
and mounted in lactic acid or cotton blue with water pretreatment for viewing outlines
of ascomata and conidiomata in vertical section. Gelatinous sheaths surrounding
ascospores and paraphyses were examined in water or 0.1% (w/v) cotton blue in lactic
acid. Color of diversiﬁed structures and ascospore contents were observed in water.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Measurements and drawings were made using materials mounted in 5% KOH and
from 30 asci, ascospores, and paraphyses for each specimen. Line and point integrated
illustrations of internal structures of fruit bodies were drawn using the microscopic
painting device (Panasoianic XSJ-2). The type specimen is deposited in the Herbarium
of Forest Fungi of Anhui Agricultural University, China (AAUF).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terriera huangshanensis sp. nov. (China) ... 371#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comments —Terriera huangshanensis is distinctive within the genus because
of the synchronously ripening asci and the hymenium that often overtops the
extension of the covering stroma when mature. The most widely distributed
species, T. minor (Tehon) P.R. Johnst., is similar but diﬀers in many aspects: its
ascomata have rounded ends and are not associated with conidiomata and zone
lines, the textura prismatica between the covering and basal stroma is poorly
developed, asci ripen sequentially, and the ascospores are 0−1 septate and
taper slightly towards both ends (Johnston 1988, 1989a, b). The type species
T. cladophila is distinguished from T. huangshanensis by subcuticular, circular
to elliptical, non-curved ascomata that are associated with brown diﬀuse zone
lines; the textura prismatica between the covering and basal stroma composed
of vertically oriented cells; sequentially ripening asci; and a subhymenium
consisting of textura angularis and textura intricata (Minter 1996).#Misc-exposition*]
