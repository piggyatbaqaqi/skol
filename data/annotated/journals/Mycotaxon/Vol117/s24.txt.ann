[@Abstract — A new polypore, Junghuhnia minor sp. nov., is described and illustrated from
the tropical forest of Yunnan Province, southwestern China. The new species is characterized
by very thin annual resupinate basidiocarps, a cream to pale buﬀ pore surface with small
and slightly lacerated pores, small (2.7–3 × 1.9–2.2 µm) ellipsoid basidiospores, and
skeletocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lignicolous fungi are important components of forest ecosystems, where
they decompose forest litter and maintain energy ﬂow and material circulation
(Lonsdale et al. 2008). Many, including some traditionally used for medicinal
purposes in Asia, are edible while others are plant pathogens (Dai et al.
2007, 2009b). New species have been described after recent investigations on
lignicolous fungi in subtropical and tropical forests in China (Cui & Dai 2008,
Cui et al. 2008, 2011, Dai et al. 2009a, 2010, Dai & Li 2010, Du & Cui 2009, Li
& Cui 2010, Li et al. 2008, Wei & Dai 2008, Xiong & Dai 2008, Zhou & Dai
2008).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Characters noted for two polypores collected on fallen angiosperm twig
during a survey of the lignicolous fungi in southern China (dimitic hyphal
system, encrusted skeletocystidia, small ellipsoid basidiospores) suggest an
aﬃnity with Junghuhnia Corda. They diﬀer morphologically from existing
Junghuhnia species, and so I describe and illustrate them as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(2010). The microscopic studies were made from sections mounted in Cotton Blue
(CB): 0.1 mg aniline blue dissolved in 60 g pure lactic acid; CB+ = cyanophily, CB– =
acyanophily. Amyloid and dextrinoid reactions were tested in Melzer’s reagent (IKI):
1.5 g KI (potassium iodide), 0.5 g I (crystalline iodine), 22 g chloral hydrate, aq.
dest. 20 ml; IKI– = neither amyloid nor dextrinoid reaction. 5% KOH was used as
reagent. Sections were studied at magniﬁcations up to ×1000 using a Nikon Eclipse
E600 microscope and phase contrast illumination, and dimensions were estimated
subjectively with an accuracy of 0.1 µm. In the spore measurements, the apiculus was
excluded. In presenting the variation of spore size, 5% of the measurements out of each
end of the range are given in parentheses. The following abbreviations are used in the
text: L = mean spore length (arithmetical mean of all spores), W = mean spore width
(arithmetical mean of all spores), Q = extreme values of the length/width ratios among
the studied specimens, and n = the number of spores measured from a given number of
specimens. Special color terms are from Anonymous (1969) and Petersen (1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarks — Junghuhnia minor is characterized by annual, resupinate and very
thin basidiocarps, pale buﬀ-yellow pore surface with white to cream margin,
small ellipsoid basidiospores (2.7–3 × 1.9–2.2 µm), and skeletocystidia.
Junghuhnia luteoalba (P. Karst.) Ryvarden also is characterized by resupinate,
pale-buﬀ colored basidiocarps and slightly lacerate dissepiments, but diﬀers in
its cylindrical basidiospores and larger pores (4–8 per mm) (Núñez & Ryvarden
2001). In addition, J. luteoalba is distributed in boreal and temperate zones.
Junghuhnia crustacea (Jungh.) Ryvarden resembles the new species in its
resupinate, thin basidiocarps and cream to pale-buﬀ pore surface but has more
shallow pores, distinctly lacerate pores and larger basidiospores (Núñez &
Ryvarden 2001, Ryvarden & Johansen 1980).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Junghuhnia minuta I. Lindblad & Ryvarden, which has similar basidiospores
(2.5–3 × 2–2.5 µm), diﬀers from J. minor by having distinctly pileate basidiocarps
and tiny pores (10–12 per mm, Lindblad & Ryvarden 1999).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Junghuhnia microspora Rajchenb. also has small basidiospores but is
distinguished from J. minor by its orange to chestnut colored pore surface and
narrower basidiospores (2.6–3.6 × 1.0–1.6 µm, Rajchenberg 1983).#Misc-exposition*]
