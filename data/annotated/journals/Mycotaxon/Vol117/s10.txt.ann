[@Abstract — Seven foliicolous species growing in tropical regions of Vietnam are reported
as new to the country. Described are Arthonia accolens, Calenia aspidota, Calopadia
subcoerulescens, Coenogonium minimum, Fellhanera rhapidophylli, F. semecarpi, and Porina
subnitidula. Among them, Coenogonium minimum and Porina subnitidula are reported for
the ﬁrst time from the paleotropics.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present paper, which is a further report on the taxonomic study of
foliicolous lichens from Vietnam by Nguyen et al. (2010, 2011), describes
seven species newly recorded from three diﬀerent localities [Thác Đray Sáp (=
Dray Sap waterfall), Vườn quốc gia Bạch Mã (= Bach Ma National Park), and
Vườn quốc gia Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng (= Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park)]
in Vietnam. The discovery in Vietnam of Coenogonium minimum and Porina
subnitidula, previously known only from the Neotropics, provides further
information about their distribution in southeastern Asia. In addition to the
newly recorded species, the authors also collected previously reported (by
Santesson 1952, Vězda 1977, Farkas & Sipman 1993, 1997, Lücking & Vězda
1998, Aptroot & Sparrius 2006) the foliicolous lichens Bacidina apiahica (Müll.

[@This is the ﬁrst report of lichens from central Vietnam. Earlier workers
(Santesson 1952, Vězda 1977, Farkas & Sipman 1993, 1997, Lücking & Vězda
1998, Aptroot & Sparrius 2006) have reported Vietnamese lichens mostly from
the northern parts of the country. Surveys of the several provinces still left
unexplored will deﬁnitely contribute further to our knowledge of the Vietnamese
lichen ﬂora. Brief taxonomic descriptions, chemical and ecological notes, and
comments are provided below for each of the newly recorded species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@The lichen samples were collected from three diﬀerent localities between 22 July 2006
and 08 February 2010. The study area covers the three Vietnamese provinces Daknong,
Quang Binh, and Thua Thien Hue. After drying at room temperature, the lichen samples
were identiﬁed using stereo and light microscopes: a NIKON Eclipse E200 dissecting
microscope was used for identifying morphological characters of thallus, reproductive
structures, color, size and shapes, while an OLYMPUS BX 50 compound microscope
was used for studying the anatomy of thalli and fruiting bodies. All measurements were
made from material mounted in water and stained in lactophenol cotton blue (LCB).
An average of ten measurements per structure was recorded for the sizes of thallus,
ascomata, and ascospores and the thicknesses of hymenium, hypothecium, exciple, and
involucrellum. Only free ascospores lying outside the asci were measured. Ascospore
dimensions are generally presented as minimum value observed – maximum value
observed. Spot test reactions were carried out on hand sections of thalli and apothecia
under the compound microscope. Iodine (I) was used to check the color reactions of
the ascus wall and the hymenium. Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was performed
in solvent system C (Toluene:Acetic acid 85:15) as described by Orange et al. (2010).
Terminology used in this study follows Lücking (2008). Vouchers have been deposited in
the herbarium of the Lichen & Allied Bioresource Center at the Korean Lichen Research
Institute (KoLRI), Sunchon National University, South Korea.#Misc-exposition*]
