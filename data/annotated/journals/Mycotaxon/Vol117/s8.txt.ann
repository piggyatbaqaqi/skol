[@Abstract —Eleven species of Lepiota section Stenosporae, reported as new for Thailand, are
fully described and illustrated. Five are compared with European and North American collections
based on nrITS sequence data. Two species possess a cutis-like pileipellis (L. aureofulvella,
L. sp. 2) and nine are characterized by a trichodermium (L. alopochroa, L. castanea, L. citrophylla,
L. erythrosticta, L. griseovirens, L. infelix, L. papillata, L. poliochloodes, L. sp. 1). New to science
are Lepiota aureofulvella (close to L. boudieri) and L. papillata, which is characterized by small
basidiomata covered with gray-brown to olive brown squamules, an orange-white to brownishorange context, spurred basidiospores with straight or outgrown base, clavate to cylindrical
cheilocystidia, and a trichodermal pileus covering. A key to Lepiota sect. Stenosporae in northern
Thailand is provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Members of the genus Lepiota (Pers.) Gray (Agaricaceae) are in general
saprotrophic forest ﬂoor dwellers (Singer 1986, Vellinga 2004b). They occur
worldwide in tropical and temperate regions, with only a few species reported
from desert and arctic-alpine areas (Vellinga 2004b). Sequence analyses
of nrITS and LSU data in the Agaricaceae have shown that Lepiota forms a
monophyletic clade together with Cystolepiota, Echinoderma, Melanophyllum,
and Pulverolepiota (Vellinga 2003ab, 2004a).#Misc-exposition*]

[@54 ... Sysouphanthong & al.#Page-header*]
[@Lepiota was traditionally divided on morphological grounds into sections
based on spore shape and (secondarily) pileus covering structure. Section
Stenosporae (J.E. Lange) Kühner, typiﬁed by L. pseudofelina J.E. Lange, is
characterized by spores with a distinct outgrowth (spur) at the base, and
a trichodermal or cutis-like pileus covering (e.g., Singer 1986, Bon 1993).
Molecular-phylogenetic analyses have since reorganized the morphologically
deﬁned sections (Vellinga 2003b). Vellinga (2003b) noted that species with
spurred spores and a hymenidermal pileus covering have been found to relate
closely to species with ellipsoid spores and a hymenidermal pileus covering,
while species with spores that lack a distinct spur, are slender, and have a
trichoderm (e.g., L. cortinarius J.E. Lange) group with species with fusiform
spores. Vellinga (2003b) also reported that species with ellipsoid spores and
a trichoderm without basal short elements form a monophyletic clade with
Lepiota sect. Stenosporae, but that three subclades can be recognized — two
with spurred spores plus one with ellipsoid spores. Here we focus on the two
spurred-spored clades.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Among the few Lepiota species previously reported from Thailand are
L. clypeolaria (Bull.) P. Kumm., L. cortinarius, L. cristata (Bolton) P. Kumm.,
and L. pseudohelveola Hora (Soytong 1994, Chandrasrikul 1996, Chandrasrikul
et al. 2008), none of which belongs to Lepiota sect. Stenosporae. However, the
following species in Lepiota sect. Stenosporae are known from other parts of
tropical Asia: L. alopochroa, L. citrophylla, L. erythrosticta, L. leontoderes (Berk.
& Broome) Sacc., and L. pyrrhaes (Berk. & Broome) Sacc. from Sri Lanka
(Pegler 1972, 1986; Petch & Bisby 1950); L. castanea, L. erythrosticta, and
L. griseovirens from southern India (Kumar & Manimohan 2009); and L. aurora
E. Horak, L. castanea, L. crepusculata E. Horak, L. erythrosticta, L. infelix,
L. luteocastanea E. Horak, and L. squamatula E. Horak from Papua New Guinea
(Horak 1981).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lepiotaceous fungi have been studied in East Asia in recent years (Ge &
Yang 2006; Ge et al. 2010; Liang et al. 2009, 2010b; Vellinga et al. 2011). The
present study focuses on Lepiota sect. Stenosporae in northern Thailand, as part
of our ongoing eﬀorts to document the diversity of Agaricaceae from this area
(Zhao et al. 2010, Vellinga et al. 2011). We used morphological and molecular
methods to identify and circumscribe our taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collecting and examination methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collecting sites in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai provinces, Thailand, were surveyed
during the rainy seasons from April to October, 2007–2010. The sites, located within the
coordinates 16°06.16′N 98°29.64′E and 19°48.60′N 99°54.60′E at altitudes of 596–1700
m, comprise diﬀerent vegetation types. Detailed notes, concerning location, vegetation
type, soil and substrate were taken in the ﬁeld. Most specimens were also photographed
in the ﬁeld. All material is deposited in the herbarium of Mae Fah Luang University#Misc-exposition*]

[@(MFLU). Macromorphological characters were noted in the laboratory based on the
fresh materials, using standard procedures and terms (Vellinga & Noordeloos 2001).
Color annotations in the macroscopical descriptions are from Kornerup & Wanscher
(1978), or if preceded by ‘Mu.’ from Munsell (1975). Microscopical characters were
studied from dry specimens and drawn using a drawing tube attached to an Olympus
CX-41research compound microscope. Characters were observed in Congo red in
ammonia, water, or in 2.5–10% of KOH. Chemical reactions in Melzer’s reagent, Cotton
blue and Cresyl blue were noted. At least 20 spores per collection were measured in side
view. The notation [180,7,6] indicates that measurements were made on 180 spores in
seven samples in six collections. The following abbreviations are used: ‘L’ for lamellae, ‘l’
for lamellulae, ‘avl’ for average length, ‘avw’ for average width, ‘Q’ for quotient of length
and width and ‘avQ’ for average quotient.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PCR and sequencing—Primers ITS1-F, ITS 1, and ITS4 were used for the nrITS1,
5.8S and nrITS2 regions, and PCR conditions followed Gardes & Bruns (1993). PCR
ampliﬁed products were cleaned up by Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering
Technology & Services Co. Ltd.). Sequencing was performed using Big Dye chemistry,
with the same primers as for PCR, and an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (both
from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All new sequences were deposited in
GenBank.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Data analysis—Sequences were edited and contigs assembled using Sequencher
4.2.2 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The sequences of all taxa
belonging to Lepiota sect. Stenosporae present in GenBank were downloaded, and
the complete data set aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et al. 2002, Katoh & Toh 2008)
and minimally manually adjusted. Heuristic search of ITS was performed using the
maximum parsimony (MP) option of the program PAUP* 4.0 b10 (Swoﬀord 2004),
using 1000 heuristic searches, employing TBR branch swapping and random sequence
addition. Other setting were as follows: gaps were treated as missing data; all characters
are of type unordered and equally weighted; multistate taxa interpreted as uncertainty;
starting trees were obtained via stepwise addition; one tree was held at each step during
stepwise addition; the steepest descent option was not in eﬀect, branches were collapsed
(creating polytomies) if minimum branch length was zero, and MulTrees option was
in eﬀect. Bootstrap supports were evaluated using 1000 bootstrap replicates with 10
heuristic searches per replicate, random sequence addition and TBR branch swapping.
A Maximum Likelihood analysis was performed with the on line program RAxML
(Stamatakis et al. 2008). All free model parameters were estimated by RAxML using
a general time-reversible (GTR) substitution matrix and a proportion of invariable
sites estimate. One hundred rapid ML bootstraps were performed. The ML tree was
visualized with the program Figtree v. 1.3.1 (Rambaut 2009).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion—As a representative of the Lepiota castanea group, L. alopochroa is
characterized by relatively short spores (averaging 8.5 × 3.9 µm) and relatively
short elements in the pileus covering; the cheilocystidia are narrowly clavate
to cylindrical. Despite these short spores and short pileus covering elements
it diﬀers from L. ignicolor Bres. in nrITS sequences (Figure 2). The Thai
collections of L. castanea have darker basidiomata, longer spores, and longer
elements in the pileus covering.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion—The L. castanea complex is in need of a combined morphologicalmolecular approach to resolve the species borders. Vellinga (2001), who took a
pragmatic view, considered L. castanea a very variable species, variable in terms
of spore length and length of pileus covering elements. Migliozzi & Zecchin
(1997, 2000) recognized several species in the complex: L. ruﬁdula Bres. for
the long-spored taxon, commonly (also by us) named L. castanea; L. ignipes
Bon is considered a synonym of L. ruﬁdula; L. castanea s. str. for one shortspored species and L. ignicolor for a taxon with small basidiomata and spores
tending toward ovoid. A collection referred to L. ignicolor is sister to L. subalba
P.D. Orton in the phylogenetic analyses based on nrITS sequences (Figure 2);
L. subalba has short elements in the pileus covering but whitish basidiomata.
The characters of the Italian collection named L. ignipes in GenBank (accession
number FJ998390) are not known, but the molecular data indicates that it
diﬀers from the other taxa in this complex.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lepiota cingulum Kelderman, which resembles L. castanea, has predominantly
pinkish brown basidiomata and a pileus covering with terminal elements that
tend to taper towards the tips (Kelderman 1994).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The record of L. castanea from Nepal (Manandhar & Adhikari 1994–95)
probably refers to another species, as the spores are described as ellipsoid.
Lepiota castanea is rare in northern Thailand and was found only at one

[@Pegler (1972, 1986), but he did not recover cheilocystidia in the material
from Sri Lanka and his described shorter pileus covering elements are shorter
(30–80 × 12–17 µm). There can be two reasons for this: the material he studied
is young, or the longer elements were degraded, broken, or otherwise not easily
found and measured.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The name L. citrophylla has been applied to both a European species (e.g.
Rea 1922; Kühner 1934) and an American species (Akers & Sundberg 1998),

[@Lepiota luteocastanea is very close to L. citrophylla in yellow basidiome
colors, but L. luteocastanea is distinctly purple tinged on the pileus and has
fusoid-cylindric elements in the pileus squamules (Horak 1981). Lepiota
subcitrophylla Hongo (1956) from Japan also comes close to L. citrophylla but
turns blue when bruised or damaged. Verrucospora vulgaris Pegler, which
resembles L. citrophylla in the brown squamules, yellow tinged basidiomata,
