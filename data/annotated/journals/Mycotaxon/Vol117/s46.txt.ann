[@studied genus, we have still a long way to go to approach a complete global
inventory.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In sect. Nigri, four new species are described, taking the total to 26;
additionally A. foetidus is placed as a synonym of A. niger, and molecular data
reveal that two further named species are colour mutants of others. Within the
black species, a separate study shows that growth rate parameters and hydrolase
activities are characters that can assist in species separations in the group.
In addition, an L-arabinose transcriptional activator regulating the pentose
catabolic pathway and involved in enzyme release is described for A. niger; it
appears to be conﬁned to Eurotiales and to have arisen by gene duplication when
the order (or family) split from other ﬁlamentous ascomycetes. In sect. Terrei,
several taxa previously treated as subspecies or varieties of A. terreus prove to
be distinct lineages and are recognized as separate species, necessitating the
introduction of three new names; an additional species is newly described, and
the teleomorph-producing Fennellia nivea is found to belong elsewhere. Sect.
Flavi is considered to include 22 species, amongst which are several formerly
placed in other sections, and two new aﬂatoxin-producers distinguished by
extrolite proﬁles as well as sequence data; these have cholesterol-reducing
and hepatoxic or neurotoxic extrolites. Finally, 21 species are accepted in sect.
Usti, of which ﬁve are described as new. That section includes two species with
teleomorphs —Emericella heterothallica and Fennellia monodii— for which
binominals in Aspergillus (with a new combination for A. monodii) are used
in anticipation of the changes in the Code (now the International Code
of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants) subsequently eﬀected in
July 2011.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The papers also demonstrate the value of the polyphasic approach, using
several diﬀerent gene sequences, extrolite, cultural, and other features in
species circumscriptions. It was also gratifying to see such an almost seamless
transition to one name for one fungus adopted here by the key workers on
these organisms, which augurs well for other cases where a monophyletic
group has a particularly familiar anamorph-typiﬁed generic name. As has
become the norm in the Studies, all papers are illustrated by exceptionally ﬁne
photographs of conidial heads and colonies, many in colour, and an occasional
SEM micrograph. All struggling to identify Aspergillus species in the sections
treated will need to consult a copy, either by having one to hand or accessing it
free of charge through the CBS website.#Misc-exposition*]

ﬁgs 47, pl. 1. ISBN 978-81-211-0753-2. Price: US$ 90.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kamal, a former professor at Gorakhpur University, has been involved in
the documentation of Indian leaf-inhabiting fungi for over 30 years. In such
speciose groups as the cercosporoid fungi, in which over 3000 species have
been described, periodic regional syntheses are necessary to translate global
monographic work into those accessible at other geographical scales. Following
the landmark monograph of Chupp (1954), which accepted 1419 species, an
account of the Indian representatives was prepared by Vasudeva (1963), who
enumerated 260 species. Now, following on from the critical compilation of
Crous & Braun (2003; see Mycotaxon 89: 518, 2003), Kamal has similarly
provided an update for India. Of the 1815 cercosporoid fungi reported to have
been recorded from India up to 2009, 1050 are accepted, including descriptions
of four new species. These are dispersed between the genera Asperisporium (5
spp.), Cercospora (254), Distocercospora (1), Passalora (143), Prathigada (8),
Pseudocercospora (527), Scolecostigmina (12), Sirosporium (15), Stenellopsis
(1), Stigmina, Verrucisporota (4), and Zasmidium (88). A staggering 129 new
combinations are made, and seven replacement names introduced. It should
be noted that in the case of the new names and some combinations, “Kamal” is
omitted (corrected by an erratum slip pasted in at the front of the book). Also,
where new names are introduced, the authors of the replaced name should not
have been placed in parentheses — for example it should be C. holarrhenigena
“Kamal, nom. nov.” and not “(R.K. Srivast., N, Srrivast. & A.K. Srivast.) nom.
nov.” (p. 51).#Misc-exposition*]
[@In the arrangement of the entries within the accepted genera, the species
names precede the generic names, an unusual practice following Crous &
Braun (2003). However, here they are not treated as a single alphabetical series
but have been separated into the accepted genera. The core elements of the
nomenclatural information, including types, also seems to have been copied
directly from the 2003 work, with an identical layout and punctuation — and
the author does indicate in the introduction that the work is “based largely on
Crous and Braun (2003)” (p. 5). However, it is stated that type material in the
principle Indian herbaria was examined unless otherwise stated, where decisions
were based on descriptions and illustrations. References to hosts and localities
in India, in some cases Indian specimens, Indian literature reports, and in some
instances notes on the species are added. There are detailed descriptions and
line drawings of the newly described species, while other species are illustrated
to show “various morphotypes in a single genus” (p. 6).#Misc-exposition*]

dedicated work and provides the necessary basis for future revisionary studies
using molecular phylogenetic methods — something necessary to resolve
unequivocally species circumscriptions and the extent of host speciﬁcities in
the cercosporoid fungi.’#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Strophariaceae is one of the families in the Agaricales whose concept
has undergone huge changes — thanks to insights derived from DNA-based
phylogenetic analyses. In the morphological sense, it consisted of the brownspored Pholiota and the purple-grey dark-spored genera Stropharia, Psilocybe,
and Hypholoma. According to Matheny et al.’s (2007) pivotal work, the family
forms one clade with the Hymenogastraceae and together they harbour, in
addition to the traditional genera, Hebeloma, Galerina, Agrocybe, Phaeocollybia,
and Alnicola (Naucoria).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Contrary to what is suggested by the book title, the book deals with the
family as originally described and excluding the modern additional genera: in
other words, Strophariaceae p.p. would have been a better title. However, as
changes in the genus concepts as depicted in recently published phylogenies
(e.g. Matheny et al. 2007) are accepted, the following genera are included:
Deconica (including Melanotus), Flammula, Hemistropharia, Hypholoma,
Kuehneromyces, Leratiomyces, Meottomyces, Phaeonematoloma, Pholiota,
Psilocybe, and Stropharia. This is a very welcome departure from the broad#Misc-exposition*]

[@The 1972 publication of E.J.H. Corner’s Boletus in Malaysia (and a 1974
follow-up publication) represents a landmark in the taxonomy of boletoid#Misc-exposition*]

[@504 ... Vellinga, book review editor#Page-header*]
[@fungi. The importance of this work is twofold. First, it provides the ﬁrst (and
still largely unsurpassed) extensive exposition of the prodigious biodiversity of
boletes in tropical East Asia. Corner (1972) described nearly 100 new bolete
species; furthermore, he noted that many species could not be described due to
the sheer abundance of collections and environmental conditions that caused
many to decompose before they could be examined, as well as to the abundance
of suitable habitat, stating in regard to the latter: “When I consider the immense
number of places unexplored mycologically in Malaysia, I think 300 species of
boleti may be no exaggeration.” Second, Corner’s book called into question the
tidiness of generic concepts that were constructed around the comparatively
depauperate north temperate mycota. Corner maintained that the deﬁning
characteristics of many bolete genera (such as color of the spore deposit) did
not hold when tested by the tropical mycota, but rather exhibited a continuum
between genera.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Despite the importance of this work, its impact on —and utility for—
subsequent taxonomic studies in tropical Asia and Australasia has been
somewhat diminished by taxonomic out-datedness and the restricted availability
of type collections and other material examined by Corner. In accordance
with his observations on intergradation of characters between genera, Corner
(1972) recognized only four bolete genera —Boletus, Gyroporus, Heimiella (now
Heimioporus), and Strobilomyces— while placing many taxa under subgenera
(e.g., Austroboletus, Leccinum, Tylopilus) that are widely recognized at generic
rank by other workers. Therefore, many taxa are in need of nomenclatural
revision to bring them up to date with current taxonomic concepts. As a result
of high humidity in both ﬁeld and herbarium storage localities, primitive ﬁeld
conditions for drying specimens, and storage methods, many of Corner’s
collections were damaged by molds, degraded by storage in alcohol formalin
(or hardened by evaporation of AF during storage), or rendered toxic by
treatment with mercuric chloride; restricted access to collections and restricted
accessibility of important microcharacters have been the result.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Given the importance of Corner’s collections and the diﬃculties inherent in
their study, the present revision by Egon Horak is a most welcome and important
contribution to the taxonomic study of boletes. Dr. Horak presents revised
descriptions of taxa combining information from Corner’s original protologues
and Latin diagnoses (the latter translated into English to facilitate study), data
gained from additional studies of Corner’s holotypes and other collections,
and data from studies of holotype collections from other collectors (including
Baker, Heim, Höhnel, Hooker, and Ridley, among others) for those species
included but not described by Corner. Horak provides analyses of 160 (124
accepted, 22 doubtful, and 14 rejected, excluded, or invalid) species, including
emended descriptions, line drawings of microscopic features (127 ﬁgures),#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycotaxon 117 Book Reviews ... 505#Page-header*]

[@lists of observations and conclusions from his studies, and nomenclatural
changes necessary for bringing the nomenclature of Corner’s taxa up-to-date
with current concepts. Additional features include taxonomic keys to all of the
treated taxa, a list of additional important taxonomic studies of boletes from
the Far East, a synopsis of all of the treated taxa arranged by currently accepted
genus, and species list indexed by speciﬁc epithet. Perhaps most importantly,
Horak brings to this study his own extensive personal experience working in
Malaysia and the Asian tropics, and is therefore able to conceptualize Corner’s
taxa in a broad comparative context.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Any taxonomic revision requires some judgments as to the placement of
species in more inclusive taxa. In the boletes, a longstanding taxonomic issue
involves character weighting of species with pale short-elliptical or phaseoliform
basidiospores; an example of this issue is Rubinoboletus, in which species have
been placed that share this spore morphology but diﬀer signiﬁcantly in other
characteristics (see Osmundson and Halling 2010). In the present revision,
Horak places a number of species with pale phaseoliform basidiospores in
Gyroporus, and in so doing emphasizes spore morphology over characteristics
(e.g., presence/absence of clamp connections, orientation of hyphae in the stipe)
emphasized by some previous authors. In the case of Gyroporus balloui (Peck)
E. Horak (= Tylopilus balloui (Peck) Singer), this placement is contradicted
by molecular evidence presented after the preparation of Dr. Horak’s volume
(Osmundson and Halling 2010), but other species remain to be evaluated in the
light of DNA sequence data. In the meantime, a provisional placement based
on spore morphology seems reasonable; this example emphasizes that some of
our present taxonomic concepts contain inherent contradictions and may very
well change in the light of additional data and analyses.#Misc-exposition*]
[@In Boletus in Malaysia, Corner – considering existing taxonomic problems
in the boletes – wrote, “I have no doubt that if the fungus ﬂora of Malaysia
can be explored before the destruction of the main forests or the elimination
of the non-commercial trees, fresh discoveries will resolve these problems.”
Biodiversity discovery, conservation, and the solution to taxonomic problems
share the need for carefully researched scholarly work on the description and
revision of species and higher taxa. Horak states that “the present revision is
only one further step in the direction to unravel the numerous bolete taxa
described from SE-Asia and Australasia;” however, his “one further step” is
a critical one: by providing a detailed re-examination of Corner’s specimens
and by bringing the taxonomy of Corner’s taxa into a modern context, Horak
has made two highly valuable contributions to the study of boletes. In this
outstanding volume, Horak will not only earn the gratitude of boletologists, but
has provided an important tool for assessing diversity, rarity, endemicity and
—unfortunately, but quite likely, given the extent and rate of forest conversion#Misc-exposition*]
