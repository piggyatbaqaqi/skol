[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@As currently accepted, Mycena sect. Longisetae A.H. Sm. ex Maas Geest.
(Basidiomycota, Agaricales, Mycenaceae) incorporates about eleven species that
are primarily characterised by several long, needle-like, thick-walled hairs on
the pileus (Desjardin et al. 2002). Additionally, these species have ascending,
narrowly adnate to free lamellae, a pruinose to hispid stipe with a typically
discoid base, ellipsoid basidiospores, 4-spored basidia, a hymenium devoid of
pleurocystidia, a pileus margin often beset with cystidia, dextrinoid pileal and
stipe trama, smooth caulocystidia that typically taper towards the apex, and a
pileipellis composed of either acanthocysts or spinulose hyphae. According to
Desjardin et al. (2002), southeast Asia could be the centre of diversity of this
group.#Misc-exposition*]
[@During our investigations on the agaric mycota of Kerala State, India, we
came across an as yet undescribed species belonging to this group that we
describe here. Mycena indica, a species originally placed by Manimohan &
Leelavathy (1988) in sect. Sacchariferae and subsequently transferred to the
amended sect. Longisetae by Desjardin et al. (2002), needs a replacement name
(nom. nov.) as the present one is an illegitimate later homonym (McNeill et
al. 2006: Art. 53.1). A nom. nov. for this species is proposed here, along with
some observations on the species. The Brazilian species M. rhaphidocephala,#Misc-exposition*]

[@240 ... Aravindakshan & Manimohan#Page-header*]
[@originally placed by Maas Geesteranus & de Meijer (1998) in sect. Sacchariferae,
has all the characteristics of sect. Longisetae and is accepted in the latter section
here.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Conventional morphology-based taxonomic methods were employed for this study.
Microscopic observations were made on material stained with 1% aqueous solution of
Congo red and mounted in 3% aqueous KOH. Melzer’s reagent was used to observe
whether the spores and tissues were amyloid. For evaluation of the range of spore-size,
twenty basidiospores each from one specimen of each collection cited were measured.
The herbarium acronyms follow Thiers (2011). The collections cited without herbarium
acronyms are in the personal herbarium of the second author. The concept of Desjardin
et al. (2002) is followed for Mycena sect. Longisetae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: This species has all the diagnostic features of sect. Longisetae
discussed earlier. The key by Desjardin et al. (2002) to species of Mycena
sect. Longisetae leads to a couplet diﬀerentiating M. breviseta Höhn. and
M. longiseta Höhn. Mycena breviseta is a poorly known species whose
holotype collection is reported to contain ‘no intact basidiomes and no pilei’
(Desjardin et al. 2002). The Desjardin et al. (2002) key describes this Javan
species as having an umbilicate pileus, pileal hairs that are up to 1000 μm long,
and clavate marginal cystidia that are entirely spinulose. The closely related
M. longiseta, also from Java, has a grey pileus and pileal hairs that are up to 1000
µm long. A perusal of Mycena literature revealed that the Brazilian species,
M. rhaphidocephala (whose infrageneric position is discussed below but hitherto
placed in sect. Sacchariferae), is strikingly similar to M. saloma in most macroand microscopic features. An examination of the M. rhaphidocephala holotype#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: Thus far known only from southern India, M. lomavritha was
originally described based on a single collection. Several collections were
subsequently made by the present authors from Kerala State, India. All our
observations support the original description except that the pileal trama was
consistently dextrinoid. Also, while the original collection was found growing
on the bark of a jackfruit tree, we found the species also growing on the bark of
other trees. Mycena lomavritha is characterised by small oﬀ-white corticolous
basidiomata with a hairy pileus and discoid stipe base, amyloid basidiospores,
dextrinoid tramal tissues, ventricose-fusoid cheilocystidia with sparsely
spinulose lower middle region, a pileipellis composed of acanthocysts as well as
scattered thick-walled, aculeate hairs, and abundant obclavate caulocystidia.
Manimohan & Leelavathy (1988) placed this species in sect. Sacchariferae
despite the thick-walled pileus hairs because sect. Longisetae then was
characterized by inamyloid basidiospores, gelatinized pileipellis, and absence
of clamp connections. Subsequently both sect. Sacchariferae (Desjardin 1995)
and sect. Longisetae (Desjardin & Horak 2002) were redeﬁned. As discussed
by Desjardin et al. (2002), the combination of characters exhibited by
M. lomavritha are clearly better accommodated in the redeﬁned sect. Longisetae,
where it seems close to M. brunneisetosa Corner from Singapore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@acanthocysts on the pileipellis, spinulose marginal cystidia with a smooth apical
prolongation, and smooth caulocystidia that taper towards the apex. We have
veriﬁed these features on the holotype of this species. What Maas Geesteranus &
de Meijer (1998) had described as cherocytes are actually the spinulose marginal
cystidia typical of the sect. Longisetae (see Desjardin 1995: 5 for the history
and deﬁnition of the term cherocyte). Our examination of these entities in the
holotype revealed that they are thin-walled —not “somewhat thick-walled” as
noted by Maas Geesteranus & de Meijer (1998)— and hence cannot be called
cherocytes. Maas Geesteranus & de Meijer (1998), who originally placed this
species in sect. Sacchariferae, noted that its combination of characters was not
known in any other species of that section. We accept M. rhaphidocephala as a
member of sect. Longisetae.#Misc-exposition*]
