[@Abstract —Ten Pouzarella species are described from New South Wales and northern
Queensland, Australia, of which eight (P. albostrigosa, P. farinosa, P. fusca, P. lageniformis,
P. pamiae, P. parvula, P. pilocystidiata and P. setiformis) are new to science and two
(P. debilis and P. lasia) are reported for the ﬁrst time for Australia. Phylogenetic analyses
of the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA (mtSSU), two variable domains (D1, D2) of the
25-28S large subunit rDNA (LSU), and a portion of the second largest subunit of the RNA
polymerase (RPB2) gene support separation of these species into three clades. Morphological
characters common to these clades are described, and a key to species based on the characters
that are distinct between clades is included.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Pouzarella Mazzer (Entolomataceae, Agaricales) was ﬁrst
monographed on a worldwide basis by Mazzer (1976). He proposed replacing
Pouzaromyces Pilát with Pouzarella because the type species of Pouzaromyces,
Agaricus fumosellus G. Winter, had no extant type material and the protologue
description had been interpreted as probably referring to a coprinaceous
species (Mazzer 1976, Noordeloos 1984, 1992; see Baroni et al. 2008 regarding
nomenclature). The name Pouzarella has since been accepted by many
researchers (Largent 1994, Karstedt et al. 2007, Baroni & Ortiz 2002, Baroni et
al. 2008, Horak 2008).#Misc-exposition*]

[@436 ... Largent & al.#Page-header*]
[@Pouzarella combines the following features: typically mycenoid basidiomata
(often resembling a smallish Inocybe (Fr.) Fr.); strongly ﬁbrillose, squamulose, or
hispid squamulose pilei; often radially strigose stipe bases; tramal hyphae with
externally incrusting pigments; pileipellis and stipitipellis hyphae with parietal
and/or externally incrusting pigments; a pileipellis (at least on the pileus center)
with erect to semi-erect hyphae composed of chains of cells; nodulose-angular,
heterodiametric basidiospores with 6–9 facets; and a hymenium frequently, but
not always, with dark brown contents or aborted basidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Because there have been no Pouzarella cited in Australian publications
on Entolomataceae Kotl. & Pouzar (Gates & Noordeloos 2007, Gates et al.
2009, Noordeloos & Gates 2009, May & Wood 1997, Grgurinovic 1997), we
provide the ﬁrst reports and descriptions of Pouzarella in Australia. Of the ten
Pouzarella species covered, four are newly described from the Barrington Tops
National Park in central New South Wales, while four new species and two new
records are cited for the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland.
We also present a phylogeny based on a supermatrix of 1985 characters from
three partial gene regions: mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU), 25–28S
nuclear rDNA large subunit (LSU), and a portion of the gene encoding the
second largest subunit of RNA polymerase gene (RPB2). The sequence analyses
strongly support separation of the ten Australian taxa into three clades, each of
which can be diagnosed by micromorphological characters.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Materials & methods#Misc-exposition*]
[@Macromorphological and micromorphological features#Misc-exposition*]

[@Specimens were collected during February–April in 2009 and 2010 from diﬀerent
sites within the Wet Tropics Bioregion in northeastern Queensland and in April 2010 in
the Barrington Tops National Park of central New South Wales. Basidiomata collected
in the ﬁeld were stored in plastic containers for transport to the laboratory. Macroscopic
features were described from recently collected fresh materials. Field GPS coordinates
for each collection were taken using a Garmin GPSmap 60CSx. Colors were described
subjectively and coded according to Kornerup & Wanscher (1978), with color plate
designations noted in parentheses. Color plate abbreviations itemize page number,
column, and row (e.g., 8D-F5-6 = p. 8, columns D–F, rows 5–6.)
Dried specimens were examined microscopically with a trinocular research-grade
Nikon Labophot compound microscope ﬁtted with bright ﬁeld optics according to
Largent (1994: 1–3); basidiospore measurements follow Baroni & Lodge (1998: 681).
Digital microphotographs were made using a Nikon Coolpix 990 camera focused
through the trinocular head of the compound microscope.#Misc-exposition*]
[@All microscopic measurements were obtained using a GTCO Corporation Graphic
Digitizer, Model DP5A-111A, connected to a laptop computer. The software utilized,
Measure Me 101 v 1.0, was modiﬁed for use on a contemporary computer from the
BASIC program, Metrics5 (David Malloch, University of Toronto). The mathematical
factors determined using this program include: arithmetic mean (xm) of basidiospore#Misc-exposition*]

± standard deviations. The sample size (n) equals the quotient (n = x/y) of the total
number of microscopic structures measured (x) and the number of basidiomata studied

[@All collections for New South Wales cited in ‘Additional collections examined’ are
deposited in The Plant Pathology Herbarium, Orange Agricultural Institute (DAR); the
Queensland collections were split with duplicates deposited in the Australian Tropical
Herbarium (CNS) and The Queensland Herbarium (BRI). All holotype and isotype
collections are deposited in the herbaria designated in the Latin descriptions using
acronyms from Holmgren et al. (1990).#Misc-exposition*]
[@DNA sequences and phylogenetic analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lyophilized basidiomata were pulverized (4 mps for 20 sec) with glass beads (FastPrep
FP120 homogenizer, QBiogene, Carlsbad CA USA). DNA was extracted with 2 ×
cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buﬀer, puriﬁed with phenol-chloroformisoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) bound to silica columns (GeneClean Turbo Columns, MP
Biomedicals, Solon OH USA), and washed with 70% ethanol (Baumgartner et al. 2010).
Portions of three loci were ampliﬁed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). PCR
primers used were MS1 and MS2 for mtSSU (White et al. 1990); Ctb6 and Tw13 for
nuclear rDNA LSU (variable domains D1 and D2; White et al. 1990); and for the RPB2
portion either pb2i6f and rpb2i7r (Co-David et al. 2009) or our Pouzarella-speciﬁc
primers, rpb2-PouF (5’ to 3’ - gaa ggt caa gct tgt ggt c) and rpb2-PouR (5’ to 3’
- cat gct ygg atg gat ttc).#Misc-exposition*]
[@The mtSSU and LSU genes were ampliﬁed in 25 µL reactions containing 1×
GoTaq Flexi Buﬀer (Promega, Madison WI USA), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 500
nM forward and reverse primers, 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.2 M betaine,
0.025 U Taq polymerase, and 1–2 µL of diluted template DNA. RPB2 was optimally
ampliﬁed according to the primer pair used. The rpb2-PouF and rpb2-PouR primerbased ampliﬁcations utilized 25 µL reactions using the above protocol, except that
betaine was increased to 1 M. The Co-David et al. (2009) based RPB2 ampliﬁcations
increased the concentrations of primers rpb2-i6f and rpb2-i7r to 1 µM and the betaine
concentration to 1 M. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: mtSSU and LSU: 94°C
for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min,
followed by a ﬁnal extension of 72°C for 7 min. RPB2: either the touchdown protocol
using primers rpb2-i6f and rpb2-i7r (Co-David et al. 2009) or [Pouzarella primers

or 52°C for 1 min 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by a ﬁnal extension of 72°C for
7 min. Unresolved sequences with overlapping chromatograms were resolved by subcloning PCR products with the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA USA)
according to Bergemann et al. (2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@PCR products were cleaned using 1 µL of ExoSAP-IT (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh,
PA USA). Sequencing reactions were carried out in 10 µL reactions containing 1 µL of
Applied Biosystems BigDye ver. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad CA USA), 0.4 µm
primer, 0.875 × Sequencing Buﬀer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad CA USA) and 1 µL
PCR water. Cycling parameters followed: 39 cycles of 96°C for 10 sec, 50°C for 5 sec,#Misc-exposition*]

[@60°C for 4 min with an inﬁnite hold at 15°C. Reactions were puriﬁed with 3 M NaOAc,
250 mM EDTA (pH 8) and ethanol by centrifugation at 2500 G. Reactions were washed
once with 70% EtOH and centrifuged at 2500 G for 15 min. Precipitated products were
stored at –20°C.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Forward and reverse sequences for each locus were generated on an Applied
Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer at Middle Tennessee State University. Sequence
contigs were edited in Sequencher 4.8 (GeneCodes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI USA) and
manually aligned in SE-Al (Rambaut 2002). Prior to tree estimation, the model selection
feature in TOPALi v. 2.5 (Milne et al. 2004) was used to test for the best-ﬁt model of
nucleotide substitution using three selection criteria (AIC1 = Akaike information
criterion, AIC2 = second order correction and BIC = Bayesian information criterion).
Each criterion selected general time-reversible (GTR) as the best ﬁtting substitution
model. All phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the combined dataset (mtSSU +
LSU + RPB2) using Lyophyllum decastes (Fr.) Singer, L. leucophaeatum (P. Karst.) P.
Karst., and Calocybe carnea (Bull.) Donk as outgroups and including two additional taxa
(Entoloma violaceovillosum Manim. & Noordel. and E. araneosum (Quél.) M.M. Moser)
known to have typical Pouzarella features (Co-David et al. 2009). Maximum likelihood
(ML) analyses implemented in TOPALi v. 2.5 (Milne et al. 2004) used a heuristic search
algorithm based on a rapid branch swapping operation (PhyML; Guindon & Gascuel
2003). The level of clade support was assessed using 100 bootstrap (BS) replicates.
Bayesian inferences (BI) were implemented in MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 (Ronquist &
Huelsenbeck 2003) using the GTR set to two runs of one million generations sampling
every 100 generations. After convergence, Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP) were
determined after calculating a 50% majority rule consensus tree.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We obtained sequences for all three loci (mtSSU, LSU, RPB2) for 22
Pouzarella collections except that we omitted one RPB2 sequence (for P.
parvula DL Largent 9901) after several ampliﬁcation attempts failed to produce
PCR amplicons that could be sequenced. The dataset comprised 686 (mtSSU),
661 (LSU), and 638 (RPB2) aligned characters assembled into a supermatrix
consisting of 1985 characters. Of these, 122 mtSSU, 61 LSU, and 104 RPB2
characters were excluded at the 5’ or 3’ ends due to heterogeneity in the lengths
of the sequences obtained for diﬀerent samples.#Misc-exposition*]

[@BPP values included for comparison. Most branches are strongly supported
by BS values greater than 70% and BPP values greater than 0.95, although in
some cases, high levels of BPP support (0.99–1.00) were found when BS values
were less than 70%. The Australian collections formed three clades (Plate 21):
Clade I formed a well-supported (BS >70, BPP = 1.00) group comprising ﬁve
species (Pouzarella lasia, P. albostrigosa, P. fusca, P. debilis, P. setiformis). Clade
II included two species (P. pamiae, P. farinosa) with high BPP (0.99) but low BS
(<70%) support. Clade III formed a well-supported group (BS >70, BPP = 1.00)
of three species (P. pilocystidiata, P. parvula, P. lageniformis). The clades can
be distinguished using micromorphological features (cheilocystidia, aborted
basidia, and pileocystidia; see Key). The Australian taxa are not resolved as
monophyletic in relation to the two European taxa included (E. araneosum and
E. violaceovillosum), though the grouping of the Australian clade III with these
species received low BS (but high BPP) support.#Misc-exposition*]

“Lamella-edge not revived.” Based on further type studies, Horak (1980)
synonymised both A. myodermus and A. fulvolanatus under Agaricus lasius, for

possesses a mild (not farinaceous) taste and odor, abundant aborted basidia,
and longer, narrower (21–82 × 8–21 µm) cheilocystidia. Our collections are
similar to Gates 2265, the proposed holotype for a new species to be described
in a forthcoming book on the entolomatoid fungi in Tasmania (Gates pers.
comm.), but diﬀers in the absence of aborted basidia, cheilocystidial shape
(clavate to broadly clavate or obovoid in Gates 2265), and farinaceous taste.

[@In Australia, we observed 30–40 P. lasia basidiomata in the same habitat
and locality twice over a 2–4 day period in mid-March 2009 and mid- to lateMarch 2010. Most pilei from basidiomata collected during the beginning days
possessed light-colored squamules over the entire surface but the squamule
base of the remaining basidiomata began to develop dark gray brown tints.
Pileal surfaces from basidiomata collected at the end of the 2–4 day period had
only dark gray brown squamules and were otherwise morphologically identical
to Pouzaromyces lasius as described and illustrated by Horak (1980). With
the exception of the light colored squamules, the basidioma features from the
beginning of the time period also matched those of Pouzaromyces lasius. Horak
apparently either overlooked the light colored squamules in young specimens
or examined only mature specimens.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Horak (1980) and Pegler (1977) studied the holotype of Agaricus lasius.
Referring to his type study in his Pouzaromyces lasius description, Horak
noted basidiospores measuring 10.5–13.5 × 6–8 µm, cheilocystidia absent,
and the terminal (1–3 cell thick) hairs on stipe [and pileus?] as thin-walled
and remaining cells as thick-walled. For the holotype, Pegler (1977) reported
basidiospores averaging 14 × 8.5 µm (11.5–15.5 × 8–9.5 µm) and a 4-µm
thickness for the cell walls of the pileal hairs. It is rather perplexing to have two
investigators study the same specimens and report such distinct diﬀerences.
Pouzarella lasia, P. domingensis from the Dominican Republic, Pouzaromyces
napaliensis from the Hawaiian Islands, and Entoloma testaceostrigosum from
the state of Kerala in India lack cheilocystidia and have similarly shaped and
sized basidiospores. Pouzarella domingensis diﬀers in the presence of inﬂated
cells in the pileal subpellis (Baroni et al. 2008), while Pouzaromyces napaliensis
has aciculate to setiform caulocystidia and pileocystidia, smaller basidiomata
(2.5 mm broad pileus, 3–4 × <1 mm stipe), and a pale yellowish-brown pileus
(Desjardin & Baroni 1991). Entoloma testaceostrigosum is separated by its larger
(12.5–17.0 × 7–10 µm) basidiospores and absence of encrusted pileipellis and
stipitipellis hyphae (Manimohan et al. 2006).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pouzarella lasia was found fruiting abundantly in two locales. All these
collections were made in a similarly complex mesophyll vine rainforest
in Danbulla National Park in northeastern Queensland. Four collections
—DL Largent 9662 (18 March 2009), 9670 (19 March 2009), 9807 and 9811

Euramoo Track, while two —DL Largent 9729 (21 February 2010), 9778
(13 March 2010)— were from the same population and identical habitat on
the Kauri Track. We found no evidence of genetic isolation among populations
separated by 4 km and the level of allelic variation within each locus is
consistent with the variation expected in interbreeding populations with a
large eﬀective population size. Future studies of these and other populations#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the past decade, eﬀorts to gain insight into the morphological features that
unite mushroom-forming fungi with their sequestrate relatives (Basidiomycota,
Agaricales) have pinpointed some unique characters that can form the basis of
natural classiﬁcations (e.g. Moncalvo et al. 2004, Matheny et al. 2006). However,
deﬁning these boundaries for large and diverse families such the Entolomataceae
with over 1500 mushroom-forming species and few sequestrate taxa (Largent
1994, Moncalvo et al. 2004, Co-David et al. 2009) can be challenging. The
basis for the early classiﬁcation of all members in the Entolomataceae is the
pinkish basidiospore deposit and angular basidiospores observed in polar
view, features that may form the basis of a natural classiﬁcation based on the
observed monophyletic support using DNA sequence data (Moncalvo et al.
2004, Matheny et al. 2006, Co-David et al. 2009).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Despite the support for the monophyly of the Entolomataceae, deﬁning
generic boundaries within the family may be challenging. For example,
several of the proposed generic concepts based on morphological features
have been questioned based on the lack of observed monophyletic support
in phylogenetic analyses (Moncalvo et al. 2002, 2004, Co-David et al. 2009).
Large genera that exemplify these problems include Entoloma (Fr.) P. Kumm.,
recovered as either polyphyletic (Moncalvo et al. 2004) or paraphyletic (CoDavid et al. 2009). A similar lack of support has been observed for Claudopus
Gillet, Leptonia (Fr.) P. Kumm., Rhodocybe Maire, and Nolanea (Fr.) P. Kumm.
(Moncalvo et al. 2002, Co-David et al. 2009). Although it is unquestionably
an under-sampled genus, monophyly of Pouzarella is supported by molecular
data (from only two collections, the European Entoloma araneosum and Indian
E. violaceovillosum; Co-David et al. 2009). In this paper, we include a phylogenetic
analysis of two European (Co-David et al. 2009) and ten Australian Pouzarella
species; given the exclusion of other entolomataceous genera, we understand
that our phylogeny neither refutes nor supports the monophyly of Pouzarella.
Nonetheless, our sequence analyses support delineation of the ten Australian
species based on micromorphological features, and features common to
these clades are highlighted as characters that may form the basis of a natural
classiﬁcation for other genera.#Misc-exposition*]
[@One interesting pattern apparent in the phylogeny is the strong support
for the monophyletic clade containing P. lageniformis, P. parvula, and P.
pilocystidiata. All species possess long cylindro-clavate pileocystidia, abundant
thin-walled lageniform to ventricose-rostrate cheilocystidia, and lack aborted#Misc-exposition*]

[@basidia (unusual in Pouzarella). Strong support was also observed for another
clade comprising P. albostrigosa, P. debilis, P. fusca, P. lasia, and P. setiformis.
One unique morphological feature common to this clade is the conspicuous
absence of cheilocystidia, a feature shared by other tropical species including
Pouzaromyces minutus (Horak 1980), Pouzaromyces napaliensis (Desjardin
& Baroni 1991), and Entoloma testaceostrigosum (Manimohan et al. 2006).
Pouzarella pamiae and P. farinosa formed a monophyletic group, although with
low ML BS support. Both possess a squamulose-hispid stipe surface and ± thick
walled cheilocystidia — features also encountered in the tropical P. ferreri and
temperate P. dysthales (Peck) Mazzer (Baroni et al. 2008, Noordeloos 2004).
