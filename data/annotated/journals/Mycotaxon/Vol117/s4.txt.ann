[@Abstract —Type specimens of two Phylloporus species originally described from
southwestern China were studied. The concept of P. luxiensis is reﬁned with additional recently
collected materials, while P. scabrosus is revealed to be a member of the genus Lentinus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylloporus Quél. is a diverse genus in the Boletaceae, the hymenophore of
which is predominantly lamellate instead of poroid (Neves & Halling 2010).
Thirteen species and one variety have been reported from China (Teng 1963;
Zang & Zeng 1978; Li et al. 1992; Bi et al. 1993, 1994, 1997; Dai & Li 1994;
Zang et al. 1996). However, some remain poorly known, especially P. luxiensis
and P. scabrosus, both originally described from the southwestern region of
the country (Zang & Zeng 1978). Only scanty information on microstructures
was provided when the two species were ﬁrst described with excellent vividly
colored plates of basidiomata (Zang & Zeng 1978); although both taxa were
later cited (Zang et al. 1996, Li & Song 2003), no additional morphological
information was given. Because many Phylloporus collections have recently
been made in the region, it is necessary to re-examine the types of the two
species to characterize them in more detail. The species are described below
based on critical examination of the holotypes and additional collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Academy of Sciences (HKAS). For comparison, the holotype of P. sulcatus (Pat.)
E.-J. Gilbert deposited in the Farlow Herbarium, Harvard University (FH) was also
examined. 5% KOH was used as a mounting medium for microscopic studies. The
notations “basidiospores (n/m/p)” indicate that the measurements were made on n
basidiospores from m basidiomata of p collections. Dimensions of basidiospores are
given using the notation (a–)b–c(–d); where the range b–c represents a minimum of
90% of the measured values, and extreme values (a and d) are given in parentheses.
Q refers to the length/breadth ratio of basidiospores; Qm refers to the average Q of
basidiospores ± sample standard deviation. All line drawings of microstructures were
made from rehydrated material. For the convenience of the readers, the original Latin
protologue of the two taxa are provided.#Misc-exposition*]
