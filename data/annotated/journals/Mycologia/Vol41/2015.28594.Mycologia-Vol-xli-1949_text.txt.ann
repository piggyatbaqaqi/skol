[@Eucene L, DuLaney#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a previous paper (1), the use of various compounds as
nitrogen sources for growth and streptomycin production in a
synthetic medium was discussed. Glucose always served as the
, carbohydrate in these experiments.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thus far, little has been disclosed of the use of various carbo-
hydrates in streptomycin fermentation mediums. The meat ex-
tract-peptone medium of Schatz, Bugie, and Waksman (5), the
soy bean medium of Rake and Donovick (3), and the near syn-
thetic medium of Vander Brook et al. (6) all contained glucose.
Hubbard and Thornberry (2), using surface fermentations, tested
a number of carbon sotrces. These compounds, both sugars and
alcohols, were added to a basal medium containing ammonium
lactate and mineral salts. Of the compounds tested, d-mannose,
d-galactose, maltose, cellobiose, mannitol, and dextrin supported
the highest yields. Saunders and Sylvester (4) also tested a few
sugars and organic acids as constituents of a synthetic strepto-
mycin fermentation medium. They employed submerged fermen-
tations with a basal medium containing a sugar, an organic acid,
an inorganic nitrogen compound, and mineral salts. Five sugars,
namely, glucose, dextrin, brown sugar, starch, and lactose, were#Misc-exposition*]

Of the organic acids tested, lactic and acetic gave the best results.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper concerns the possible substitution of a number of
carbon sources, i.c., sugars. alcohols, and organic acids, for glucose
in synthetic streptomycin fermentation mediums.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The experimental conditions were the same as those employed
in the testing of various nitrogen sources in synthetic streptomycin
fermentation mediums (1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures were developed by spreading spores from the soil tube
previously used (1) over Blake bottle slants of yeast extract-
glucose agar. After seven days’ incubation at 28° C., fifty ml. of
sterile distilled water were added to each Blake bottle culture and
a spore suspension prepared. One ml. of this spore suspension
was added to each fermentation flask.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basal medium contained the following salts in one liter of
distilled water: NaCl 5.0 gm.. K,HPO, 2.0 gm., MgSO,-7H,O
1.0 gm., CaCl, 0.4 gm., FeSO,-7H,O 20.0 mg., and ZnSO,-7H,O
10.0 mg. The nitrogen and carbon sources were added to this salt
solution. Because the metabolism of the carbohydrate is affected
by the nitrogen source, each carbon source was tested in mediums
containing three different nitrogen sources. These nitrogen com-
pounds were employed at the following concentrations: (NH,).-
HPO, at 4.0 gm. per liter, enzyme-digested casein at 10.0 gm. per
liter, and 1(—) proline at 15 gm. per liter. The carbon sources were
added to these three different mediums before sterilization and the
pH adjusted, when necessary, to between 7.0 and 7.5 with 1 N
NaOH.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mediums were dispensed in +0-ml. amounts in 125-ml.
Erlenmeyer flasks and autoclaved at 121° C. for 17 minutes.
The pH was checked after autoclaving, and no medium with an
initial pH below 6.5 was used. After inoculation, the flasks
were incubated at 28° C. on a rotary-type shaker moving at 220
r.p.m. so that it described a circle one inch in diameter. After
growth started, the flasks were sampled daily until after the maxi-
mum broth potencies were reached. The whole broth samples#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]
[@Sugars: None of the pentoses supported high yields ot strepto-
mycin. Only two aldopentoses, namely, d-ribose and 1-xylose,
supported streptomycin production in the medium containing an
inorganic nitrogen source. The yields thus obtained were quite
low, 10 y/ml. and 48 y/ml., respectively. Neither of the methyl-
pentoses, namely, l-rhamnose or fucose, supported yields in the
(NH,),HPO, medium. In the medium containing enzyme-
digested casein as the nitrogen source, the use of l-arabinose,
lyxose, l-rhamnose, d-ribose, d-xylose, and l-xylose resulted in#Misc-exposition*]

[@streptomycin titers significantly higher than were obtained in the
casein medium with no sugar added. Perhaps some of the pen-
toses would support high yields if some specific amino acids
served as the nitrogen source. With I(—)proline as the nitrogen
source, however, none of the pentoses except l-xylose resulted
in yields higher than were obtained in the proline medium to which
no sugar had been added.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All three of the aldohexoses, i.c., glucose, d(--)mannose and
galactose, supported growth and streptomycin production though
the yields were markedly different depending upon the nitrogen
source used in the medium. In the (NH,),HPO, and casein-
digest mediums, glucose was the best of the three sugars, with
galactose intermediate and d(+)mannose supporting the lowest
yields. However, in the medium containing I(—)proline as the
sole nitrogen source, the use of d(+)mannose resulted in ex-
ceptionally high streptomycin broth potencies. High yields were
also obtained with glucose in combination with 1(—)proline but
not with galactose plus 1(—) proline.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two ketohexoses were tested. Sorbose would not support
growth in the (NH,),HPO, medium. In addition, when sorhose
was added to the casein-digest medium, lower yields were ob-
tained than in the casein-digest medium to which no sugar had been
added. Also, no growth was obtained in the l(—)proline me-#Misc-exposition*]
[@DULANEY: STREPTOMYCES GRISEUS. ITI 7#Misc-exposition*]

[@dium to which sorbose was added. Levulose, on the other hand,
was a relatively good carbohydrate, though not so satisfactory as
glucose.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In all, five disaccharides were tested. All of the C,-disac-
charides, i.e., cellobiose, lactose, and maltose, supported growth
and streptomycin production in the (NH,),HPO, medium. Of
these three, maltose was superior when used in conjunction with
an inorganic nitrogen source. In the casein-digest medium, how-
ever, approximately comparable yields were obtained with all
three. When 1(—)proline served as the sole nitrogen source, the
use of maltose resulted in yields far superior to those obtained
through the use of lactose or cellobiose.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Melibiose, a C,-disaccharide, supported the best yields when
used in the medium with 1(—)proline. When used with the inor-
ganic nitrogen compound, no growth was obtained.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sucrose, a disaccharide with the hexose molecules linked
through the reducing groups, was a poor carbon source in the
(NH,),HPO, medium. In addition, sucrose was also an in-
ferior carbohydrate in the casein-digest and 1(—)proline mediums.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two trisaccharides, namely, melezitose and raffinose, do not
offer much promise. Growth was not obtained when they were
used in the (NH,),HPO, medium, and low broth potencies were
produced when they were used in conjunction with the organic
nitrogen sources.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Of the polysaccharides, only inulin failed to support growth
when used with an inorganic nitrogen compound. In addition,
low streptomycin broth potencies were obtained in the inulin-
casein digest and inulin-1(—)proline mediums. Dextrin and
starch, however, appear to be promising carbohydrates, though
neither of the lots tested was as good as glucose in the casein-
digest or (NH,).HPO, mediums. Both dextrin and starch sup-
ported relatively high yields in the 1(—)proline mediums. The
results would seem to warrant the testing of a series of dextrins
and starches.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alcohols: In all, eleven alcohols were tested in the three me-
diums. Of these eleven, only glycerol and mannitol supported
growth in the (NH,),HPO, medium. The use of glycerol re-
sulted in relatively low streptomycin broth potencies in all three#Misc-exposition*]
[@8 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@mediums. Mannitol, however, when used in the (NH,),HPO,
or 1(—)proline mediums, supported yields about equal to those
obtained with the use of glucose in these mediums.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The addition of the other alcohols to the casein digest or
1(—) proline mediums resulted in lower yields than were obtained
in these two mediums to which no alcohol was added. Sorbitol
exerted the most deleterious-effect. No streptomycin was formed
in the casein digest of 1(—)proline mediums to which sorbitol was
added.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Organic Acids: The fifteen organic acids listed in table III were
tested in the (NH,),HPO, and casein-digest mediums. The
1(—) proline medium was not used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the organic acids were added to the casein-digest me-
dium, the resulting streptomycin broth potencies were always
lower than those obtained in the casein-digest medium to which
no organic acid was added. Only seven of these acids supported
growth and streptomycin formation in the medium with inorganic
nitrogen. The highest broth potency obtained was 22 y/ml. in
the pyruvic acid (NH,),HPO, medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The results with organic acids indicate that they offer little
promise when used singly in place of carbohydrates in synthetic
streptomycin fermentation mediums.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is obvious from the above results that quite high streptomycin
broth potencies may be obtained in synthetic mediums. More-
over, the specific carbon source added to these mediums greatly
affects the fermentation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the sugars, the pentoses and trisaccharides do not offer
much promise when used as single carbohydrates. A number of
the hexoses, disaccharides, and polysaccharides supported quite
high streptomycin titers. There seems to be no clear correlation
between the structure of the sugar molecule and the yield ob-
tained. A number of these more promising sugars, however,
are composed of glucose molecules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the exception of mannitol, none of the alcohols supported
high yields. The organic acids that were tested were likewise
poor carbon sources.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In analyzing the above results, however, several points should
be borne in mind. The compounds tested were added singly te#Misc-exposition*]

[@the three mediums. With an increasing knowledge of the mecha-
nism operating in the streptomycin fermentation, various combina-
tions of these compounds might be used to advantage. In addi-
tion, these compounds were tested with one set of fermen-
tation conditions using only three different nitrogen sources.
The nitrogen source has a striking effect on the availability
of the carbohydrate. The results obtained in the (NH,),HPO,
and 1(—)proline mediums to which d(+)mannose was added
serve as examples. Low streptomycin broth potencies were
obtained in the mannose-(NH,),HPO, medium, whereas good
growth and high streptomycin broth potencies were obtained
in the mannose-proline medium. In an attempt to stimulate
streptomycin production in the mannose-(NH,),HPO, medium,
a number of organic acids, i.e., acetic, citric, lactic, fumaric,
pyruvic, succinic, and malic, were added as individual supple-
ments at a 0.05 per cent level to this medium. In no instance did
a stimulation of streptomycin production occur. Several amino
acids, i.z., dl-alpha-alanine, l-aspartic acid, 1(—)proline, 1(—)
leucine, 1-glutamic acid, and glycine, were also used as individual
supplements to this medium. Again there was no stimulation of
streptomycin production.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should also be noted that the criterion used in these experi-
ments was streptomycin broth potency and not growth. It does
not necessarily follow that good growth will result in high strepto-
mycin titers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. A number of sugars, alcohols, and organic acids were tested
as carbon sources in three streptomycin fermentation mediums.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. The streptomycin broth potency obtained was greatly af-
fected by the carbon source as well as by the source of nitrogen
employed in the medium. The highest yields were obtained in the
medium with 1(—)proline as the sole nitrogen source.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. The pentoses were poor carbon sources.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. Among the hexoses, glucose and mannose supported the
highest yields. The high streptomycin titers obtained by the use
of mannose occurred only in the medium containing 1(—) proline
as the nitrogen source.#Misc-exposition*]
[@10 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. Maltose was the best of the disaccharides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. The trisaccharides were inferior carbohydrates under the
experimental conditions that were used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@7. The only polysaccharide supporting low yields was inulin.
The results obtained with the starch and dextrin would appear
to warrant the testing of a series of these compounds.#Misc-exposition*]

[@8. Among the alcohols, only mannitol was a promising carbon
source.#Misc-exposition*]

[@9. None of the organic acids supported high streptomycin broth
potencies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE ALBERT COMMONS * COLLECTION
OF FUNGI IN THE HERBARIUM OF
THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCI-

ENCES IN PHILADELPHIA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Davin R. Sumstine#Misc-exposition*]

[@This collection of fungi has been stored in the Academy of
Natural Sciences for many years. The specimens are still in the
original containers, such as newspapers, small match boxes, and
other boxes, and identifications as well as other data are written
on the blank parts of the newspaper and on the boxes. Some
collections have a printed label. With the exception of the
agarics, the specimens are well preserved for the most part and
the material is generally ample. The specimens of agarics were
pressed and only a few have been identified. There are no field
notes giving the color, texture and other desirable characters for
identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the material was evidently identified by J. B. Ellis in
whose herbarium duplicates of most of these specimens probably
will be found. But many specimens were also sent to Charles H.
Peck, A. B. Seymour, and William Trelease for identification.
The name of the person identifying the specimen is generally
given, and many are marked as new species. The original de-
scription usually refers definitely to the collection number and
locality given on the label of the specimen. From this it would
appear that these specimens are types or isotypes. Most of the
specimens were collected in Delaware but a few came from New
Jersey, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This collection has intrigued me for many years as I made fre-
quent visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences. Some time ago,#Misc-exposition*]

[@* Albert Commons was born in Doe Run, Chester County, Pennsylvania.
January 23, 1829. He became interested in Botany through his half-brother
Franklin Commons. He began collecting in Delaware in 1842. His collec-
tions consist of flowering plants, mosses, hepatics, lichens and fungi. He
died in 1919,#Misc-exposition*]

[@12 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@I suggested to Dr. F. W. Pennell, Curator of Plants, that the col-
lection should be made available to mycologists for study, and
offered to undertake its arrangement if the Academy would pro-
vide the necessary supplies. My offer was readily accepted and
the specimens have been placed in suitable packets with printed
labels.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No attempt has been made to make a critical study of these more
than 4,000 specimens. The purpose is only to arrange them and
make them accessible for study. Mycologists will find here a
rich field for investigation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In presenting a list of the species in one group, the Hyphomy-
cetes, I hope to give a general idea of this collection. This enu-
meration will include the name of the species as given by the per-
son identifying it, the collection number, the host, the locality, and
the date.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A few personal notes will give some information that seemed
valuable. When a specimen is marked as a new species, the origi-
nal publication is given. This means that the publication refers
directly to that specimen. Some of these specific names are, no
doubt, synonyms and some should be transferred to other genera.
This transfer will be left for specialists in the various groups.
Probably at some future date, an enumeration of the other groups
will be published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All correspondence concerning permission to examine these
specimens should be addressed to Dr. F. W. Pennell, Academy of
Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, Pa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MzawrLLE T. Cook#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 9 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species was found on the young leaves of young plants
that were not more than six inches in height and growing in wet,
usually muddy, soil. Infected plants growing in a dry environ-
ment were infected before the subsidence of the water and drying
of the soil. The galls were most abundant on the under surfaces
of the leaves but were found to some extent on the petioles and
rarely on the upper surfaces of the leaves (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The
infections started as small, green spots in which small, bright
green, hemispherical galls are formed. In the later stages, these
galls were large and usually conical with a pit or crater-like cavity
in the center (Fic. 8). The infected cell was at the bottom of a
crater. The mature gall rested almost or entirely on the surface
of the leaf or petiole but in some cases the basal part was em-
bedded in the host tissues (Fic. 8).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The infections were in young epidermal cells (Fic. 4) as in all
other species studied by the writer. The infected cells grew rap-
idly. The galls were formed by a growth of the epidermal and
mesophyll cells surrounding the infected epidermal cells. The cells
composing the galls may or may not be elongated (rrGs. 7, 8).
’ When the galls were partly submerged, the cells of the host tissues
were more or less modified (Fig. 8). When the galls were numer-
ous they caused a more or less pronounced deformity of the leaf
or petiole (ric. 3). In some few cases, the epidermal cells of a
new gall became infected which resulted in a pronounced com-
pound gall. In some cases a second zodspore endeavored to pene-
trate the infected cell through the opening in the cone. If it failed
to do so, it increased in size for a time and died (Fic. 9). ,#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus was very light lemon color at first, became yellow,
orange, and brown with age and was visible at the bottom of the
crater at a very early period in the development of the gall. It
filled the host cell in a very short time (Fic. 4). In many cases
the fungus died and turned black before maturity. After a time
the infected cell grew more rapidly than the fungus, which did not
completely fill the host cell (Figs. 5, 6, 7). The fungus was
granular with a well defined nucleus. The segmentation of the#Description*]

[@fungus to form sporangia was not observed. Many dead, empty
galls were seen and the writer is of the opinion that the fungus
became separated from the gall before the formation of the spo-
rangia. The fungus grew rapidly and was surrounded by granular
material or modified host cell contents which became modified into
a dense granular or solid substance (FrGs. 5, 6). The infected
cells were pear shaped (#1G. 7) or irregular (Fics. 5, 6). In the
latter case the contents’ of the cell appeared.to be amoeboid but
there was no evidence of disintegration of cell walls of the host
plant. The host cell nucleus is very definite and occasionally two
host nuclei are present. The host nuclei may or may not be at-
tached to the nucleus. Occasionally two fungi were found in the#Description*]

[@Late in November, 1945, a purple sediment was noticed on the
bottom of an unfrozen pond (water temperature 6° C.) in the
vicinity of Ann Arbor, Michigan. An examination of this ma-
terial showed it to consist’ primarily of a colonial purple bacterium
and occasional filaments of a one-banded, replicate-walled species
of Spirogyra. Of particular interest was the fact that the alga
was heavily parasitized by a phycomycetous fungus, readily recog-
nizable as Olpidiopsis Schenkiana Zopf. Thalli, zoosporangia,
and sex organs of the parasite were relatively plentiful in the algal
filaments. A closer inspection of the material revealed a fact of
unusual interest, namely, that the algal parasite was, in turn, para-
sitized by an endoparasite which, like its host, was also a phyco-
mycete.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Olpidiopsis Schenkiana is well known from the classic re-
searches of Zopf (13), and since his original discovery of the
fungus it has been collected a number of times in Europe (2, 3, 4,
6, 8, 11, 12), once in India (1), and has been mentioned by Kar-
ling (5) as occurring in the vicinity of New York. Because of
paucity of information concerning the species in the Western
Hemisphere and because the presence of an endoparasite—ap-
parently a new species—serves to offer an explanation of certain
puzzling figures which have appeared in the European literature
of this fungus, its occurrence in Michigan has seemed worthy of
note.#Misc-exposition*]

[@OLPIDIOPSIS SCHENKIANA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stages in the infection of the algal cell were not found in our
material. They have, however, been excellently described by
Zopt (lc). . Very early in the development of the thallus, the
chloroplast of the alga contracts and undergoes a progressive dis-
solution. Destruction is initiated in the immediate vicinity of the
young thallus and the chloroplast and nucleus are very soon frag-
mented. The parts of the chloroplast become noticeably nar-
rower, lobed and constricted, as indicated in ric. A. As destruc-
tion continues, the two halves of the chloroplast seem drawn to-
wards the fungus thallus and destroyed. Ultimately, the entire
structure is reduced to an irregular, hyaline, gelatinous-appearing
mass lying close to and extending out from either side of the
body of the parasite. Whatever substance is active in the dis-
integration of the chloroplast is apparently of great potency and
readily diffusable from cell to cell, since chloroplasts in cells re-
mote from the infected one, but in the same filament, are obviously
affected. "These in contrast to chloroplasts in nearby, uninfected
filaments, are distorted and contracted. Furthermore, the bright
green color is soon changed to a yellow-green. Contraction and
discoloration of the chloroplasts of entire filaments were so con-
stantly associated in our material with infection by the Olpidiopsis
that when such algal plants were found, one could be absolutely
certain that somewhere in the filament there was a thallus of the
fungus. This extreme and powerful toxicity is in striking con-
trast to the action of many pathogens of higher plants, such as leaf
parasites, where the interloper actually seems to exert a preserving
influence on cells not immediately in the area of infection. There
is no induced hyperplasia and usually little hypertrophy of the
host cells. Occasionally, cells containing old parasites became
somewhat enlarged in the region of the parasite, but this was not
a typical reaction.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The young thallus is at first ellipsoidal; its cytoplasm is hyaline,
glistening, and bears a few granules and vacuoles (Fic. A). As
it becomes older, it increases in size, the protoplasm becomes
granular, and there is formed a large central vacuole (Fic. B).
Subsequently, a discharge tube develops which quickly grows#Misc-exposition*]

[@through the wall of the Spirogyra cell (FIG. C). Cleavage of the
contents of the sporangium into zoospores was not observed. It
was noted, however, that the process took place before deliques-
cence of the tip of the single stout discharge tube. Zodspore dis-
charge in our material tended to support the claims of previous ob-
servers, including Zopf, that the zodspores swim away without en-
cystment. To be sure, there may be a period of amoeboid activity
at the mouth of the tube, but there was no evidence that the spores
ever encysted, as in Achlya, to emerge later as motile bodies, as
Scherffel (8) has stated sometimes occurs. Observations on the
hyperparasite, to be described later, may serve to explain this ap-
parent discrepancy. The zoospores are of the laterally biflagellate
type, 8 X 6 4, with unequal, oppositely directed flagella. In addi-
tion to swimming, they may undergo periods of marked amoeboid
movement (FIG. D). Occasionally they may become quiescent in
the sporangium, after having failed to escape at the moment of
discharge (FIG. E).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Resting spore formation was also observed. Formation of
these bodies is preceded by a sexual process entirely similar to
that found in other species of the genus and involves the conjuga-
lion of two thalloid gametangia. One, the receptive thallus, after
receiving the contents of the other, steadily enlarges and becomes
invested with a somewhat thickened, smooth wall (FIGS. F,G). An
irregular, large central vacuole forms in the content which, in our
material, occasionally tended to pull away from the resting spore
wall (FIG. G). According to Zopf, this resting structure becomes
converted into a zodsporangium at germination.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE HYPERPARASITE OF OLPIDIOPSIS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the sporangial material of O. Schenkiana, there were
some which were obviously parasitized by another Phycomycete.
This hyperparasite was present only in the vegetative and spor-
angial stages,#Misc-exposition*]

[@From one to four thalli were found in a single sporangium of
the host. When developing singly, the body was asymmetrical
and bilobed (FIGS. H, J) whereas when more than one was pres-
ent, the lobing tended to be suppressed and the shape ellipsoidal
(FIG. K). The contents of the immature thallus were hyaline and
bore numerous small vacuoles. At maturity, it becomes converted
into a single zoósporangium bearing one to several narrow dis-
charge tubes which penetrate the wall of both the host sporangium
and the Spirogyra cell and extend for a varying distance outside
in the water. The zodspores are delimited within the sporangium,
escape individually and rapidly, and, as in Achlya, encyst at once
at the orifice of the discharge tube (FIG. M). After a variable pe-
riod of encystment, usually less than an hour, they emerge as
zoóspores of the secondary, biflagellate type (FIG. L). No fur-
ther stages in the life history were observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is quite evident from the figures in Scherffel’s (8) and Dom-
jan’s (3) papers that this hyperparasite was present in their
material of Olpidiopsis Schenkiana. Scherffel has noted what he
terms “secondary sporangia” within the empty sporangia of Olpi-
diopsis, and similar structures are shown by Domjan. These are
interpreted here as belonging to the hyperparasite. Furthermore,
Scherffel’s observations that the zodspore discharge may some-
times be of the Achlya type can also be explained on the basis
that he was actually observing this process in the hyperparasite.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The proper generic disposition of this fungus on the basis of
thallus structure and non-sexual reproduction alone is difficult.
Because of its tubular, lobed, or branched thallus, it strongly
resembles a species of Petersenia or Pontismu. However, in these
genera, zodspore discharge is like Olpidiopsis, no Achlya-like#Misc-exposition*]
[@SPARROW & ELLISÖN : OLPIDIOPSIS SCHENKIANA 33#Misc-exposition*]

[@encysted spore stage occurring. In the Ectrogellaceae of the
Saprolegniales, on the other hand, fungi are found which resemble
closely the present one. In the genus Ectrogella, the thallus is
tubular, or, as in the present fungus, if several are in a cell, ellip-
soidal; the sporangia are provided with one to several discharge
tubes. Furthermore, in zoóspore discharge there is a strong
tendency for the emerged zoóspores to encyst immediately or
very soon aíter escape. Comparison might also be made with
Aphanomycopsis. Here, however, zodspores are formed in only
a single row in the sporangium, not a feature of our fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Pythiella vernalis Couch, a close resemblance is found to
the Spirogyra parasite in both the manner of zodspore discharge
and host plant. Here, the zodspores encyst at the orifice of the
sporangium and later escape from the cysts as biflagellate struc-
tures. The fungus parasitizes Pythivm, a filamentous Phyco-
mycete. Our fungus differs from Pythiella, however, in having
tubular, lobed sporangia rather than spherical ones. If resting
spores had been present, the generic affinities of the Olpidiopsis
parasite could be decided with more certainty. Until these are
found and their method of formation studied, the generic disposi-
tion of our fungus is in some doubt. It seems best at this time
to include it in Ectrogella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@By reason of the striking difference in host plant of our fungus
from the algal-inhabiting species of Ectrogella, it-is considered a
new species. In naming it, we have chosen to honor one who has
always had a keen interest in aquatic Phycomycetes, Ernst A.
Bessey.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE SPECIES OF TYMPANIS OCCURRING
ON PINUS 1#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. Watton Groves 2 and A. Mavis Leach 3#Misc-exposition*]

[@(WITH 7 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The problem of species identification in the genus Tympanis
has interested the senior author for a number of years and collec-
tions and cultures have been accumulated for the purpose of
making a comparative study. Special interest is attached to the
species occurring on pine because of the Tympanis canker de-
scribed by Hansbrough (1936) and caused by a species that could
not bé identified at that time. Dr. Hansbrough generously placed
a large number of his collections at our disposal, and after a critical
study of the available material by the junior author, we have dis-
tinguished three species occurring on pine.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These species are recognized principally by the character of the
primary ascospores, which are fusiform, one- or two-celled in T.
hypopodia, subglobose in T. pithya, and elongate-fusiform to
clavate-fusiform and one- to several-celled in T. cémfusa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thirteen species of Tympanis have, at various times, been re-
ported as occurring on Pinus. Of these, five can be eliminated
at once as not being true T'ympanis species. These are T. pithya
(Fr.) Sacc. which will be discussed in detail below, T. amphibola
(Massal.) Karst. (= Pragmopara amphibola Massal.), T. bacil-
lifera Karst. (= Pragmopara bacillifera (Karst.) Rehm), T. Taut-
siana Ruhland which appears to be a Biatorella from the descrip-
tion and certainly can be excluded from Tympanís on the basis of
the red color, and T. sepiaria Karst. which cannot be placed satis-
factorily at present. No material of this species has been seen, but
since no secondary ascospores have been described and the de-#Misc-exposition*]

[@scription does not suggest a Tympanis, it can be excluded from
this genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two of the remaining names, T. laricina (Fckl.) Sacc. and T.
Buchsti (Henn.) Rehm, may be disregarded as being the result of
misdeterminations. T. laricina was originally described on Larix
by Fuckel (1870) and the specimen in Fuckel Fung. Rhen. 2473
was cited. This specimen has been examined and appears to be
distinct from any of the specimens on pine but does agree with
other collections on Larix. T. laricina appears to be a distinct
species occurring on Larix and any record on other hosts is prob-
ably due to a misdetermination. T. Buchsii was originally de-
scribed by Hennings (1903) as occurring on Abies. No material
of this species has been examined but studies of numerous collec-
tions and cultures of Tympanis species occurring on Abies indicate
that they are distinct from the pine-inhabiting species. There-
fore, it seems highly probable that reports of T. Buchsii on pine
are also the result of misdeterminations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Probably the best known and most frequently used name is T.
Pinastri Tul. This name was given by Tulasne (1865) to a
fungus that was unquestionably a Tympanis and was said to be
on Abies. The name has since been applied more or less indis-
criminately to any Tympanis found on conifers by many authors.
However, it is clear from the Tulasnes’ account that they consid-
ered their fungus to be Cenangium Pinasiri Fries and their spe-
cific epithet is, therefore, based on the earlier Friesian name. Rehm
(1889) has shown that Cenangium Pinastri Fries is not a T'ym-
banis and has transferred it to Tryblidiopsis. He retained the
Tulasne name for a species of Tympanis but this is not permissihle
under the International Rules. According to Article 54, Tympanis
Pinastri Tul. must be considered as being based on Fries’ type and
therefore a synonym of Tryblidiopsis Pinastri (Fr.) Rehm. Thus,
Tulasne’s fungus is left without a name and the combination
Tympanis Pinastri is invalid for any Tympanis species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The descriptions of T. farinacea (Pers.) Rehm are so incom-
plete that it is impossible to decide whether or not the fungus
belongs in Tympanis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Of the remaining four names, the earliest is T. pithya (Karst.)
Karst. which dates from 1867 when a specimen was issued in#Misc-exposition*]
[@Groves & Leacu: TYMPANIS ON PINUS 61#Misc-exposition*]

[@Karsten’s Fungi Fenniae 661 as Patellaria pithya Karst. with a
printed description on the label. According to Articles 36 and 37
of the International Rules this is a valid publication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the literature, T. pithya Karst. has been confused with
Cenangium pithyum Fries. Fries (1822) described Cenangium
pithyum on Pinus sylvestris and cited the specimen in Fries
Sclerom. Suec. 172. Through the kindness of the late Dr. D. H.
Linder it was possible to examine a slide of this specimen which
is labelled Excipula pithya. This slide disclosed a fungus with
filiform, many-septate ascospores. There was no evidence of sec-
ondary ascospores and the asci were not Tympanis-like. Evi-
dently, therefore, Cenangium pithyum Fries is not a Tympanis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Patellaria pithya Karst. was not based on C. pithyum Fr. but
was published quite separately and based on the specimen in Karst.
Fung. Fenn. 661 as noted above. Examination of a slide from
this specimen in the Farlow Herbarium, and later examination of
the specimen in Kew Herbarium, has shown that this fungus is
actually a Tympanis. The size of the asci agrees well with the
size stated in the description on the label and it has ellipsoid to
subglobose primary ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Karsten (1871a) transferred the fungus to Tympanis. He did
not describe primary ascospores but he cited the specimen in Fung.
Fenn. 661 and the size of the asci as stated in his description agrees
with that found in the actual specimen. The description given by
Karsten (1871b) is evidently also based on the specimen in Fung.
Fenn. 661.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Confusion arose from Karsten’s later description (1871c) in
which, under the name T. pithya, he actually described T. hypo-
podia Nyl. and cited the specimen in Karst. Fung. Fenn. 754.
Karsten recognized that this was T. hypopodia for he cited it as
a synonym, but he failed to realize that T. pithya and T. hypo-
podia were distinct species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saccardo (1889) unfortunately followed Karsten’s later and. er-
roneous account. On the basis of the two-celled primary asco-
spores, Saccardo made the combination Cenangella pithya (Karst.)
Sacc. and cited T'ympanis hypopodia Nyl. as a synonym. In the
meantime, Fuckel (1870) had described a fungus which was
really a Tympanis ‘under the name of Cenangium pithyum Fr.#Misc-exposition*]
[@62 Mycotoaia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saccardo, thereupon, created the combination Tympanis pithya
(Fr.) Sacc. Although Saccardo was careful to point aut that
this was not T. pithya Karst. it was, of course, a later homonym
of Karsten’s name and invalid under the present-day rules even
if Fries’ fungus were a Tympanis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The climax to the confusion came when Rehm (1889) wrote the
name as Tympanis pithya (Fr.) Karsten, a combination which
never existed. Karsten at no time made any reference to Cenan-
gium pithyum Fries.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thus, Tympamis pithya (Karst.) Karst. is a valid name for a
species of Tympanis occurring on pine and of which the type is
Karst. Fung. Fenn. 661; T. pithya (Fr.) Sacc. is a synonym of
Cenangium pithyum Fr. whatever it may prove to be; and T.
pithya (Fr.) Karst. is an imaginary combination that never ex-
isted in fact.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nylander (1868) described three species of Tympanis on pine
which must be considered: T. hypopodia, T. confusa, and T. am-
phiboloides var. hypopodiza. This is the first really critical study
of Tympanis and Nylander was the first and for many years the
only one who made an attempt to study and describe the primary
ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@T. hypopodia was said to have two-celled primary ascospores
8-9 x 2-3 µm in asci 8-9 µm in diameter, becoming 10-11 µm in diam-
eter when multi-spored. The type was collected by Karsten in
1859. A specimen in Karst. Fung. Fenn. 754 collected in 1860
has been examined. It is apparently not the type but it agrees
in every respect with Nylander’s description and is the basis of
our concept of this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@T. confusa was described by Nylander (1868) based on the
specimen in Fries Sclerom. Suec. 336 under the name Patellaria
atrata Fr. Nylander found that this was really a Tyınpanis and
described the primary ascospores as elongate-fusiform, 1—3-septate,
16-25 X 3-4 µm in asci 16-184 in diameter. The multi-spored asci
were said to be 125-150 x 24-25. Through the kindness of
Miss E. K. Cash it was possible to examine a slide from this
specimen. We found primary ascospores exactly as described but
the asci were narrower, the multi-spored asci being mostly 16-18
in diameter and occasionally up to 21 p.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Figs. 1-4 Species of Tympanis.#Figure*]

[@64 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@T. amphiboloides var. hypopodiza was also described by Ny-
lander (1868) and there were only two points of difference be-
tween this and T. confusa. The primary ascospores were said to
be about the same size but seven septate with an occasional longi-
tudinal septum, and the asci were 11-15, in diam., with the
multi-spored asci about 100-110 X 16 µm. Saccardo (1889) raised
it to specific rank and transferred it to Scleroderris on the basis
of the primary ascospores but it is unquestionably a true Tyimpanis.
A specimen in Karsten Fung. Fenn. 753 labelled T. amphiboloides
var. hypopodiza was examined and the asci were mostly 110-140
X 16-20- (22) µm with elongate-fusiform primary ascospores, mostly
one to three septa but occasionally more. This specimen appears
to be identical with T. confusa from Fries Sclerom. Suec. 336.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the species causing the canker of red pine described by Hans-
brough (1936), the primary ascospores were’ said to be 11-25 X
3-5 µm and three- to nine-septate. This has been confirmed from
an examination of Hansbrough’s material and thus, as far as the
primary ascospores are concerned, they match both the type of
T. confusa and the specimen in Karst. Fung. Fenn. 753 labelled
T. amphiboloides var. hypopodiza. However, the asci in Hans-
brough’s species were said to be 12-17 µm in diameter and this was
also confirmed from examination of his specimens. It was unusual
for an ascus to exceed 16 in diameter. This agrees with the size
given in Nylander’s description of T. amphiboloides var. hypo-
podiga but is narrower than the asci observed in the Fries and
Karsten specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Evidently, Nylander considered that there were two species
and this possibility cannot be entirely ruled out. If so, the name
T. confusa should be used for the species with mature asci 16-20 µm
in diameter, whereas var. hypopodiza would require a new com-
bination in Tympanis and be used for the species with mature asci
mostly 13-16 µm in diameter. From the material examined, septa-
tion of the primary ascospores would be a wholly unreliable char-
acter for species differentiation and the distinction ‚would rest
solely on the difference in ascus size. It seems scaely justifiable
to recognize a species on an extreme difference of 3-44 in the
width of the asci in only two specimens of an admittedly variable
group. We have, therefore, decided to regard T. confusa and T,#Misc-exposition*]
[@Groves & Leacu: TymMpanis on Pinus 65#Misc-exposition*]

[@amphiboloides var. hypodiza as synonyms, of which T. confusa
is the valid name. Hansbrough’s fungus is referred to this species
and the description below is based principally on his material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The difficulty of identifying these species is enhanced by the
great similarity in many of the characters. The apothecia in all
three species are black, sessile to substipitate, separate or cespitose,
and about the same diameter. T. confusa does tend to be more
regular in outline, more strongly erumpent, and substipitate,
whereas T. pithya is usually sessile and strongly undulate. The
apothecia of T. hypopodia are usually slightly smaller than those
of the other two species. However, these characters all vary con-
siderably in different collections, often differing according to their
occurrence on young twigs or more mature bark. It is not pos-
sible to identify them by the gross appearance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The consistency and tissue structure are identical in all three
and are of no value in species differentiation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The asci, as usually observed, are multi-spored, containing hun-
dreds of minute, hyaline spores. These are actually secondary
spores and might be regarded as conidia. They, also, are similar
in all three species. It generally requires careful search to find the
true or primary ascospores. They are indistinct and transitory,
and frequently it is impossible to find them.at all. We have found
no evidence that they are ever discharged from the asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hansbrough (1936) suggested that the asci should be considered
physiologically mature when the primary ascospores have been
formed but not morphologically mature until the secondary as-
cospores are formed. Since the asci do not appear to discharge 2 at
the primary ascospore stage it is questionable whether they aré
really physiologically mature at this time. It is certain that they
are not morphologically mature at this stage and this is an im-
portant point in the identification of species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the asci are in the primary ascospore stage and for some
time after the secondary ascospores have begun to form, the wall
of the ascus is greatly thickened and gelatinized. As the ascus ap-

proaches maturity the wall becomes thinner until it is not noticeably
thicker than in asci in related genera. If measurements are made
on the thick-walled asci they will be found to vary considerably,#Misc-exposition*]
[@66 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@whereas in the fully mature thin-walled asci they are relatively
constant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The size of the mature asci is, thus, of considerable value as a
diagnostic character. T. hypopodia can be recognized with rea-
sonable certainty from the ascus size alone, which rarely exceeds
90µm in length and 12 in width. In general, the asci of T.
pithya are slightly longer and wider than those of T. confusa, but
there is considerable overlap in size. When most of the asci ex-
ceed 15 µm in diameter it is usually T. pithya, and when most of them
are less than 15, it is usually T. confusa. However, the two
European collections cited above proved to be exceptions and often
it is impossible to place a specimen with certainty from ascus size
alone in these two species. Chief reliance must be placed on the
primary ascospores as a means of separating these species,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Except in T. confusa, where there are rarely more than four
primary ascospores, the asci usually contain eight. Nylander
(1868) spoke of the asci being up to twenty-four-spored but we
have not been able to confirm this. It does seem that in the early
stages of the formation of secondary ascospores, the first bodies
formed are larger than the ultimate secondary ascospores. Very
rarely, broken asci have been observed from’ which these bodies
were emerging. They were larger and more irregular in size and
shape than the secondary ascospores, but the true primary asco-
spores were not apparent. It is believed that Nylander observed
something like this. Asci at this stage are very confusing for
they may seem to contain numerous globose spores or several,
many-septate, elongated spores, but careful search will usually re-
veal the true primary ascospores in other asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Brefeld (1891) stated that the secondary ascospores arose hy
budding from the primary ascospores, and figured primary asco-
spores with secondary ascospores forming as buds on the ends.
We have also observed this especially in T. pithya, where the pri-
mary ascospores sometimes appear to bear appendages, which
have been interpreted as budding secondary ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In contrast to Dermea (Groves, 1946), where the conidial
states proved to be of great diagnostic value in identification of
species, in Tympanis the conidial fruiting bodies and conidia are
very similar in all of the species. The fruiting bodies are usually#Misc-exposition*]
[@Groves & Leach: TYMPANIS ON PINUS 67#Misc-exposition*]

[@ovoid to cylindric, associated with more or less stromatic tissue,
black, similar in consistency and tissue structure to the apothecia,
and containing cavities lined with filiform conidiophores from
which the conidia arise at the tip and along the sides. The
conidia are indistinguishable in the various species and almost in-
distinguishable from the secondary ascospores, although they may
be slightly larger and more variable than the latter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Von Hóhnel (1914) erected the genus Pleurophomella for the
conidial states of Tympanis species, of which the type was Pleuro-
phomella eumorpha (Penz. & Sacc.) v. Hóhn., said to be the
conidial state of Tympanis Pinastri. It is not possible to dis-
tinguish any of the conidial states of Tympanis species unless they
are directly associated with the apothecia. If cultures can be ob-
tained from the conidial state it may be possible to identify the
species but such identifications are at best uncertain. P. eumorpha
was originally described from Pinus and probably is the conidial
state of one of the three species recognized in this paper but it is
not possible to say to which one it belongs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All three of these species have been studied in culture from iso-
lations originating from both ascospores and conidia. When the
asci are allowed to discharge on to agar, the whole mass of second-
ary ascospores forms a yeastlike colony which at first continues to
grow by budding, but soon puts out a delicate fringe of hyphae.
Conidia arise, not only by budding from other conidia, but also
along the sides of the hyphae, forming a Pullularia-like colony.
In older colonies, there is more extensive development of my-
celium and sometimes a little whitish aerial mycelium is produced.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures have been grown on two per cent malt extract agar and
on sterilized twigs of the host. Conidial fruiting bodies are pro-
duced readily on agat by'all three species. In T. pithya there is,
perhaps, more tendency to produce irregular black stromatic masses
which sporulate more rarely. In T. hypopodia the conidial fruit-
ing bodies tend to appear later than in the other species, and to
be slightly :smaller and more scattered, but these characters are
not clear cut and vary so much in different isolates of the same
species that it does not seem possible to identify them by cultural
characters alone.#Misc-exposition*]
[@68 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@On sterilized twigs they produce very little aerial mycelium but
pycnidia are usually abundant and larger and more cespitose than
observed in nature. Apothecia have been produced on the twigs
from ascospore cultures of all three species and also from conidial
cultures of T. pithya.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE GENUS CERACEA CRAGIN#Misc-exposition*]

[@G. W. MARTIN#Misc-exposition*]

[@(WITH 13 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Ceracea was established by Cragin (Bull. Washburn
Coll. Lab. Nat. Hist. 1: 82. 1884) on the basis of a single col-
lection which consisted of a waxy incrustation covering a cluster
of pilei of a pore fungus, referred to as "apparently P. versicolor."
The essential characters in Cragin's generic description were the ef-
fused, waxy habit and the "mostly bifurcate" sporophores. In
the description of the type species, C. vernicosa, the spores are
said to be borne “at the apices of the basidia.” The clear in-
ference from these statements is that Ceracea is a member of the
Dacrymycetaceae characterized by a broadly effused, waxy basidio-
carp. As such it was accepted by Patouillard (Bull. Soc. Myc.
Fr. 9: 141. 1893), who assigned to it a second species from
Ecuador, by Hennings (in Engler and Prantl, Nat. Pf. I. 1**: 99.
1897), by Bresadola (in Krieger, Fungi Sax. No. 1909. 1906),
who recorded a species from Saxony, by Bourdot and Galzin (Bull.
Soc. Myc. Fr. 39: 266. 1923), who added an additional species
from France, by Killermann (in Engler and Prantl, Nat. Pfl. ed.
2.6: 120. 1928) and by several authors since.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lloyd (Myc. Notes 6: 899. 1920) stated that there is no doubt
that Ceracea Cragin is the same as Arrhytidia Berk. & Curt. pub-
lished many years earlier. The comment by Coker (Jour. Elisha
Mitchell Soc. 43: 237. 1928) implies that he agreed with Lloyd.
Killermann cites Berkeley’s genus as a synonym of Ceracea. Why,
it such case, he did not use the earlier name is not clear, but the
form of citation suggests that he may have supposed it to be
a nomen nudum. Brasfield (Am. Midl. Nat. 20: 213. 1938)
cited “Ceracea auct. not Cragin” as a synonym of Arrhytidia but
later (Lloydia 3: 106. 1940) he recorded an Iowa collection re-
ferred to Ceracea crustulina Bourd. & Galz. and gave it as his
opinion that the genus Ceracea is valid but should be "restricted to#Misc-exposition*]

[@78 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1049#Misc-exposition*]

[@the thin, resupinate, easily separable forms which show no evidence
of distinct rooting portions.” Jackson and Martin (Mycologia
32: 693. 1940) accepted the genus on that basis and added an
additional species, and, with elimination of the reference to the
separable character, it was the sense in which I adopted it in the
survey of the Tremellales of the north central United States (Univ.
Towa Stud. Nat. Hist. 18°: 23. 1944), restricting Arrhytidia to
those species which are at first discoid or pustulate and rooted at
the center but which early anastomose and form a more or less
continuous film.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some years ago I was informed that most of Cragin’s speci-
mens had been destroyed by fire and that the type of C. vernicosa
was probably among them. Recently, however, Dr. D. P. Rogers
has discovered in the Ellis collection at the New York Botanical
Garden what is undoubtedly a substantial part if not all of the
material on which Cragin’s genus was based (FIG. 1) and it is
therefore possible to clarify our conception of it. There are
seven sporophores or clusters of a pore fungus, together with a few
smaller fragments, quite probably representing Polyporus versi-
color, as Cragin suggested. The upper surface is completely and
the lower surface partly covered by a dull, reddish-brown, horny
incrustation. The interior has been largely destroyed by insects
but the surface has apparently been untouched (FIG. 2). When
soaked, the surface layer becomes waxy and paler. Microscopic
examination shows that this region is composed of densely packed,
branching conidiophores (FIG. 3), the spore-bearing branchlets
often more or less thickened, sometimes notably so, and the ter-
minal branchlets often in pairs (FIG. 7), suggesting basidia of the
Dacrymyces-type. The spores are borne profusely, much of the
outer, horny portion being composed of densely agglutinated
spores. They are apparently borne singly. No chains were ob-
served and there is only one point of attachment visible on each
spore, The shape is irregular; some are suballantoid and look like
Dacrymyces spores, but the majority are ovate, tear-shaped, oblong
or irregular. Empty spore-case cases suggest that in some in-
stances the contents have slipped out. In size they are mostly
6-10 X 3-5 µm with a few spores above and below these limits.#Misc-exposition*]

[@80 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Obviously Ceracea is an imperfect fungus, to be classed with the
Moniliaceae, possibly near Monosporium. Tts removal from the
Dacrymycetaceae raises the question whether the broadly effused,
subarid or waxy species belonging to that family and heretofore
referred to Ceracea may properly be included in Arrhytidia or
should have a new genus erected for them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original generic description of Arrhytidia Berk. & Curt.
(Hooker’s Jour. Bot. and Kew Misc. 1: 235. 1849) is as fol-
lows: “Hymenophorum a mycelio mucedineo contexto formatum
marginatum, tectum hymenio ceraceo molli laevi sine plicis. Sporae
oblongae." The emphasis is on the smooth, waxy hymenitim
with mycelioid margin. The description of the type species, A.
flava Berk. & Curt., immediately following, adds that the species
occurs on pine branches, that it forms scattered, sometimes con-
fluent patches, that the hymenium is orange-yellow, bordered ly
the white mycelial margin and that the spores are obliquely at-
tached. Berkeley summarizes his conception by comparing it
with Psilopezia and adding: "It is a distinctly bordered, mostly
pezizaeform Merulius, destitute of folds.” Shortly thereafter
Fries (Nova Acta Soc. Sci. Upsal. III. 1: 114. 1851) stated
that under the microscope Arrhytidia had the organization of a
Dacrymyces and that in an old fructification it could scarcely he
distinguished from that genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Patouillard (Bull. Soc. Myc. Fr. 11:211. 1895), in describing
new species of Guepiniopsis from Ecuador, states of two of them
that they might perhaps be referred to Arrhytidia because of the
pezizoid form of their fructifications. These, it will be noted, are
cupulate and stipitate species and the emphasis is therefore on
Berkeley’s use of the word pezizaeform. He adds: “ce dernier
genre [1.¢., Arrhytidia] ne présente pas de caractéres tranchés le
séparant de Guepiniopsis. A. flava Berk., dont nous avons pu
étudier des spécimens authentiques, a un pied radicant et des
dimensions plus grandes, mais tous ses autres caractéres sont ceux
de G. andinus.” Further on, he emphasizes the intermediates be-
tween the genera of the Dacrymycetaceae as then recognized, but
cites the “plaques corticioides” of Ceracea as representing one ex-
treme.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Martin: Tue Genus Ceracea CRAGIN 81#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coker, in the 1928 paper cited, propdsed the name Arrhytidia
involuta (Schw.) Coker, based on Dacrymyces involutus Schw.,
reducing A. flava Berk. & Curt., Dacrymyces corticioides Ell. &
Ev., Ceracea corticioides (Ell. & Ev.) Pat. and Ceracea aurco-
fulva Bres. to synonymy, and was inclined to agree with Lloyd
that Ceracea Lagerheimii Pat. is also a synonym.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Miss E. M. Wakefield has kindly examined the type of Arrhy-
tidia flava at Kew and has compared it with the type of Ceracca
aureo-fulva in the British Museum, and states: “I think they are
certainly not the same species. Whether they belong to the same
genus, I am not sure.... The spores of Ceracea aureo-fulva
Bres. are as described, 11-17 x 514-7 µm, but I was unable to see
any septation in the British Museum specimen. The spores of
Arrhytidia flava (type) are larger, 20-25 x 7-8 µm and become
3-septate.” She adds that Ravenel No. 1016 from South Carolina
appears to be similar, but a specimen from Alabama, collected by
Peters and named by Berkeley, has smaller spores, is obviously
gelatinous and may be Dacrymyces involutus, i.e., Arrhytidia in-
voluta Coker, 1928. A specimen from Coker, sent as D. involutus,
is effused, but was obviously gelatinous when fresh and has the
smaller spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Walter H, Snell, o£ Brown University, has permitted me to
examine a collection from the Curtis Herbarium labelled “Arrhy-
tidia flava B. & C. Ala.,” presumably in Curtis’ hand. The speci-
men consists of a small rectangle of decorticated wood, about
3 X 1.5 cm. in size, bearing a number of flat, discoid, often anasto-
mosing fructifications (FIG. 4). The substratum appears to be
wood of a soft, frondose tree, possibly Liriodendron or Populus;
it is certainly not that of a conifer. The color, dry, is about
Mikado Brown (R)* with paler (Clay Color R) margins. The
individual disks, when free, range from 1 to 2.5 mm. in diameter,
each attached by a stout, root-like base. Anastomosis apparently
begins rather early and causes the disks to become irregular in
outline, but in no case was the junction between adjacent disks
completely obliterated. The basidia are typical of the family#Misc-exposition*]

[@(Fig. 8). There may be a clamp-connection at the base of each
basidium, but since the supporting hyphae collapse early, this is
not clear. Clamp-connections are abundant on the internal hy-
phae and are of the loop type characteristic of gelatinous Basidio-
mycetes. The few spores seen were short-cylindrical and adaxially
depressed or suballantoid, 14-16 x 5.5-7 µm. No septate spores
were seen. This specimen agrees with the Peters collection from
Alabama as described by Miss Wakefield and essentially with
Coker’s description of A. involuta except for the absence of septate
spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems clear that the specimens which have been referred to
Arrhytidia and to Ceracea (exclusive of the type) fall into two
groups. One group originates as pustules, each pustule rooted in
the substratum, but anastomosing early and forming reticulate or
more or less continuous, tough-gelatinous or subgelatinous films,
drying horny. The members of the other group originate as corti-
cioid plaques on a mycelial base, becoming broadly effused, are
without conspicuous rooting bases and are waxy to subfleshy in
consistency, drying arid. For the members of the first group the
generic name Arrhytidia is available. The members of the second
group are, in my opinion, generically distinct and, since Ceracca
is not available, I propose for them the following genus:#Misc-exposition*]

[@These are the collections previously referred to Ceracea crustu-
lina Bourd. & Galz. by Brasfield and myself. Through the kind-
ness of Dr. Marcel Locquin I have been permitted to examine a
portion of the type of C. crustulina labelled "Pl. du Gard, Galzin
No. 5793.” The material seen consists of a continuous film about
8X2 mm. in extent, with a marginal area characterized by a
coarse mycelial weft bearing scattered fruiting areas varying from
less than 1 mm. across down to mere expansions at the junction
of the mycelial strands. The color of the fruiting area in dry
material is very close to brownish drab (R). In the continuous
portion there is evidence of the fusion of separate appressed
patches similar to those in the marginal area. The texture is sub-
fleshy, not horny, and there is no reason to believe that it is at all
gelatinous when soaked. The probasidia are cylindrical-clavate,
20-25 X 2-4 µm before the development of the epibasidia, becoming
forked in characteristic dacrymycetaceous fashion; the basidio-
spores are cylindrical, slightly curved, without septa so far as
observed, 10-10.5 x 3.5—4 4. These measurements are in sub-
stantial agreement with those given in the original description.
Each basidium has a clamp-connection at the base and there are
numerous clamp-connections on the internal hyphae. The micro-
scopic details are shown in figure 10.#Misc-exposition*]

obviously closely related to Ceracea crustulina, but differ in the

color, although this last character is probably of little significance.
Some of the spines bear protruding hairs at the tip (FIG. 12)
and these were observed in one instance (FIG. 13, right) to bear
conidia. This may have been a response to moist conditions after
collection when a spore-print was being secured.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While it would ordinarily be desirable to designate one of the
older species as the type of the genus, in the present instance the
abundance of material of the Iowa species, permitting wide distri-
bution of type or authentic specimens, seems to make it desirable
to designate C. pallidus as the type.#Misc-exposition*]

crustulinus (Bourd. & Galz.) comb. nov., based on Ceracea

and Cerinomyces canadensis (Jacks. & Martin) comb. nov., based
on Ceracea canadensis Jacks. & Martin, Mycologia 32: 693. 1940.#Nomenclature*]

[@The concept of Arrhytidia here suggested is that, except for its
firm-gelatinous or waxy texture, it is similar to Dacrymyces, in its
earlier stages, beginning as a group of rooted pustular or discoid
fructifications which soon anastomose and eventually form a netted
or more or less continuous film on the substratum, The type is
A. flava Berk. & Curt. A. involuta (Schw.) Coker is probably
distinct ; the difference in spore size alone between the two species
is far beyond the limits ordinarily regarded as possible within a
single species. 4. enata (Berk. & Curt.) Coker and A. pustulaia
Brasf. appear to be valid. Ceracea aureo-fulva Bres. and C. Lager-
heimti Pat. may also be synonyms of A. involuia, as Coker was
inclined to believe, but as to these I should be inclined to reserve
judgment. I reproduce drawings (FIG. 9) from the type of C.
Lagerheimii, now in the Farlow Herbarium, for purposes of com-
parison. These were made many years ago and I unfortunately
did not at the time make notes of other features, but the large,
gelatinous-walled spores with thick septa and the abundant conidia
suggest that the species may be distinct from A. involuta although
closely related and to be included in the same genus. C. elongata
Pat. (Mem. Acad. Malgache 6:9. 1928) from Madagascar, with
very large, finally 7-septate spores, appears to be clearly distinct
and should, perhaps, also be referred to Arrhytidic.#Misc-exposition*]
[@86 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cerinomyces is effused from the first, the fructification beginning
as small fertile areas on a loose subiculum and spreading by
anastomosis and extension. It lacks the prominent rooting bases
of Arrhytidia and the texture is fleshy to arid, in this respect and
in manner of growth and appearance suggesting Corticium or,
when the hymenium is tubercular, Grandinia. C. pallidus is the
type species, C. crustulinus (Bourd. & Galz.) and C. canadensis

[@(WITH 1 FIGURE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@P. Hennings (Hedwigia 36: 246. 1897) described the mono-
typic genus Didymochlamys and its type species D. ustilaginoidea,
occurring on ovaries of Rhynchospora sp. collected by Ule in
Brazil. The generic name was later changed by Saccardo (Syll.
Fung. 14: 430. 1899), apparently at Hennings’ request, to
Kuntseomyces to avoid confusion with Hooker's Rubiaceous genus
Didymochlamya.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Von Hoehnel (Sitzb. Akad. Wiss. Wien Math. Nat. Kl. 119:
2-4, 1910) studied Hennings’ type and provided a more com-
plete description, commenting in particular on the spores with
very thick, three-layered membranes or walls. He did not feel
that the fungus was generically distinct from Cintractia and he
accordingly set up the new combination C. ustilaginoidea (P.
Henn.) Hoehn. Dietel (in Engler and Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam.
(ed. 2) 6:19. 1928) discusses the fungus as Kuntzeomyces and
illustrates the spores diagrammatically. He assigns it to the
Tilletiaceae in contrast to Hennings who placed it in the Ustilagi-
naceae. Until the spores have been germinated its family classi-
fication remains problematical although there is no reason to be-
lieve it belongs other than to the latter family. Clements and
Shear (The Genera of Fungi, pp. 156 and 340. 1931) set up a
new name, Perichlamys, for this fungus and attribute it to P.
Hennings without explanation. This name does not appear to
be justified. .#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second collection of this unique species has recently become
available for study from the Chicago Museum of Natural History.
It was collected in 1922 by Macbride and Featherstone at Mito,

the collection is scanty, there is sufficient material to demonstrate

[@As pointed out by von Hoehnel practically the only difference
between the fungus under discussion and certain species of Cin-
tractia, such as C. leucoderma and C. pachyderma, lies in the
possession of three layered spore membranes by the former. The
outer membrane ruptures readily, permitting the spore proper
with its gelatinous layer to pass out freely. Pressure of the cover
slip in an ordinary mount breaks a considerable portion of the
outer spore walls as seen in figure 1 A. As far as known this
phenomenon does not take place in other species assigned to
Cintractia. Von Hoehnel did not think these spore characters
were of generic significance but the writers feel that they are and
therefore prefer to maintain the fungus under the name Kuntzeo-

[@ARTICLE 64 AND THE NOMENCLATURE OF LICHENS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tt is perhaps the opinion of botanists generally who have given
thought to Article 64 of the International Rules of Botanical
Nomenclature that the primary intent of that Article is to elimi-
nate as a nomen confusum any epithet based upon a type speciinen
containing parts of different species which had been assumed by
the author of that epithet to be one species only, as in the case
of a type consisting of flowers of one species, leaves of another,
etc. In instances of this kind there is proper doubt as to which
of the several species the epithet may apply. Since in the case of
lichens every type specimen inevitably would contain a fungus
and its algal symbiont, some interpretations of Article 64 would
invalidate practically all lichen nomenclature—a result most cer-
tainly not contemplated by the authors of the Article and one that
actually reduces the Rule to absurdity. Such legalistic hair-
splitting is, however, the inevitable result of acceptance of the
widely held doctrine that a lichen is a ‘dual organism,’ part fungus,
part alga.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is, of course, true that most elementary text-book definitions,
and those in dictionaries also, continue to propagate the notion
that a lichen is a combination of two components, a fungus and
an alga, living in some sort of symbiotic relationship. This con-#Misc-exposition*]
[@90 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@cept of lichens as an ecological association would logically preclude
their recognition as phylogenetic and taxonomic entities by the
usual system of classification; and to accept it would require a
new lichen nomenclature—an entirely needless and disorganizing
performance. The lichens have received unusually competent
monographic treatments with a well-recognized and accepted
nomenclature; in fact in the entire history of systematic botany
the nomenclature of lichens has been characterized by less con-
fusion than that of other thallophytes. It is usually taken for
granted nowadays that certain erroneous concepts of a former
time can be corrected without invalidating all the previous per-
tinent nomenclature. Thus what is commonly called a ‘lichen
thallus’ is recognized today as a peculiar colonial development of
a fungus that is in close association, symbiotic or parasitic, with
a colony of algal cells, of one or more species, which it encom-
passes. The morphological features most significant in the tax-
onomy of lichens are structures clearly recognized as fungal; and
the fungus in many instances can be propagated in pure culture
free from its algal associate. The characters and identities of the
algal ‘symbionts’ or ‘hosts’ are of secondary taxonomic signifi-
cance; in fact in some cases lichen species may have more than
one species of algal associates. -Even if some taxonomists of
lichens have recognized that in certain genera all the species are
limited to one genus of algal associates that fact is of no more
taxonomic consequence than recognition of the fact that in certain
genera of parasitic fungi all the species are restricted to related
host plants. The significance of the alga on the morphology and
taxonomy of the lichen is of no more moment than that of the
symbionts, hosts or nutritive substrata of many other fungi. The
fact, of late widely recognized, that species of Septohasidium de-
rive their nutrition primarily from scale-insects rather than from
the bark of trees to which they are attached, and that this relation
is responsible in large part for their peculiar lichen-like aspect has
caused no fear that the nomenclature of species of Septobasidium
is invalid. Likewise recognition of the symbiotic relation of cer-
tain agarics and boletes to the roots of some higher plants can
hardly be expected to have any revolutionary effect upon the
nomenclature of either associate. If later investigations disclos-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Notes and Brief Articles 91#Misc-exposition*]

[@ing new information on the nutritive relations of an organism
necessarily invalidates its name then all nomenclature becomes an
irrational nightmare.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fact that original descriptions of lichens have included
characters of the gonidia (cells of the algal associate), unfortu-
nately often called the “algal component of the lichen,” is small
cause for invalidating their names. ‘Recognition of the relation
of gonidia adds no real confusion to lichen systematics. Most
descriptions of plants as originally drawn later require emendation ;
and the fact that most descriptions of lichens assumed or stated
that gonidia were an integral part of the named organism rather
than symbionts or hosts, as is the modern concept, is fundamen-
tally inconsequential, except for the assumption in some quarters
that these earlier descriptions contravened Article 64 of the
present-day Rules. '#Misc-exposition*]

[@The modern concept of lichens with gonidia recognized as
symbionts or hosts should preclude the invalidation of their names
on account of the wording of Article 64; but, lest the present
wording of that Article provide any impediment to the present

prefer to regard a lichen as a ‘dual organism’ it is here proposed

[@SCIENTISTS AND RESERVE OFFICERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Department of the Army has established a program of
particular interest to mycologists and other scientists who hold
Reserve commissions in the Army, and who are professionally
engaged in teaching or research and development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The objectives of the program are to:#Misc-exposition*]

[@(1) maintain the useful affiliation of mycologists and other
scientists with the Organized Reserve Corps,#Misc-exposition*]

[@(2) provide peacetime Reserve assignments ‘for these officers,
enabling optimum utilization of their education, experience

[@Notes and Brief Articles 93#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Technical Services of the Department of the Army submit
to these Research and Development Reserve Groups research
problems and projects which pose an intellectual challenge to
members of the groups. Thus, the program provides members
of each group a type of training which is in keeping with their
scientific and technical interests and competence, rather than a
traditional kind of training session in which scientists have little
or no interest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The program is now being implemented only in those areas
where there is a definite local interest. To date, eighteen Re-
search and Development Reserve groups have been organized.
Twelve additional groups are in process of organization. Others '
are in the initial stages of formation. Several of these groups
have been formed in communities in which large universities, in-
dustrial research laboratories, or private research foundations are
located. Typical localities are Chicago, Illinois; Wilmington,
Delaware; Newark, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Washington,
D. C.; Manhattan and Lawrence, Kansas; Champaign-Urbana,
Illinois; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Denver, Colorado; and De-
troit, Michigan.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Provision is made to submit research projects of interest to all
categories of scientists—chemists, physicists, engineers, geologists,
geographers, psychologists, mathematicians, and all of the biologi-
cal scientists which will include mycologists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Reserve officers who are currently engaged in civilian research,
college or university teaching, or industrial research or develop-
ment, or who in the past have had specific research experience
are eligible to make application for assignment to an Organized
Reserve Research and Development Group. A group may be
organized in any locality where there are twenty (20).or more
qualified officer scientists who desire to participate in the program.
A subgroup may be organized with ten (10) qualified members.#Misc-exposition*]

originally published in Brittonia (6: 1-120. 1947). The re-

Botanical Nomenclature (1935) has been closely followed, with
such modifications and additions as are required by the actions of
the Congress at Amsterdam in 1935. One of the most important
deviations from the third edition is the treatment of “Nomina
Generica Conservanda." Generic names proposed for conserva-

III. The genera of Phanerogamae are arranged according to
Dalla Torre and Harms, Gen. Siphonogam. and the genera of
other groups alphabetically. A grouping of names by families is
also given for the Algae and Fungi. A general alphabetical index
to all the names treated in Appendix III is added. This treat-

[@This volume is the sixth in the series Annales Cryptogamici et
Phytopathologici and is in the form of a symposium of articles
by various investigators. A brief introduction by the editor is
followed by four papers or chapters which summarize the infor-
mation available on individual fungous disease groups, each written
by a specialist in the group concerned. These include accounts of
the pathogenic Torulopsidaceae by J. Lodder and A. de Minjer;
Chromoblastomycosis, by A. L. Carrion and M. Silva; Pityro-
sporum ovale by R. W. Benham, and of Coccidioides by C. W.
Emmons. These accounts bring to a focus a vast amount of scat-
tered literature, and similar accounts of other fungus pathogens
would be welcome. The use of the form genus name Fonsecaca
for the pathogens of Chromoblastomycosis which have three types
of conidial formation, each of which already bears a form genus
name (Phialophora, Hormodendron, Acrotheca), raises the ques-
tion as to whether we are now liable to be inflicted with new
generic names for all combinations and permutations of the conid-
ial stages of pleomorphic fungi. The recognition and establish-
ment of some rules of usage for form genera names, in the Inter-
national Code of Nomenclature, is a matter that should receive
attention.#Misc-exposition*]

sions of the action of sulfonamides and antibiotics, by F. T. Wolf;
the lipids of fungi, by R. L. Peck; Nutrition and Metabolism,
by W. J. Nickerson and J. W. Williams. These chapters, again
bring together and synthesize much scattered information con-
cerning the physiology of these fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This volume is of particular value to those interested in the
pathogenic fungi because of the biological, rather than the clinical
or taxonomic, approach found in most other books on this subject.

[@Identifications in this, the largest class of the Fungi, have always
been very difficult for all except specialists in small groups. Taxo-
nomic units have been erected on gross morphological characters
which fluctuate with varying environments or ecological habitats.
Important fundamental characters such as those of the ascus, or
those of the ascocarp centrum, have been largely ignored in estab-
lishing relationships. This has resulted in artificial groupings and
keys of little practical use especially in the identification of random
collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since the turn of the century there have been very few compre-
hensive monographs of the Ascomycetes, and so the mycologist still
has to fall back on one of two systems: that of Saccardo (22) in

[@SYSTEMS OF CLASSIFICATION NOW IN USE#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the publication of the Pflanzenfamilien in 1897, a classifi-
cation of the Ascomycetes was presented which has been the one
generally taught in American mycology courses, This has been
due chiefly to the widespread use of the two books by F. L. Stevens
(25, 26), which are for the most part translations of the above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From the modern point of view the orders or suborders are ap-
parently collections of unrelated forms. Many changes in the
classification have heen suggested, but so far they have not been
incorporated into an over all system.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Helvellineae, Pezizineae and Phacidiineae have heen revised
on the character of the ascus opening. Seaver (24) has mono-
graphed the Operculates, and Nannfeldt (19) the Inoperculates in
part.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Hysteriineae, Nannfeldt (l.c.) has taken the Hypoderma-
taceae out of the order and placed the members in the Helotiales,
and has made the Ostropaceae the type of a new order, the Ostro-
pales. In addition he has placed the Hysteriaceae, sensu stricto,
in the Pseudosphaeriales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Perisporiales have also been broken up, aud the Micro-
thyriaceae placed in the Hemisphaeriales by Theissen and Sydow
(28). They include in the Perisporiales only the Firysiphaceae
and Perisporiaceae. The recent viewpoint is to consider the
Erysiphaceae quite distinct and to erect the order Erysiphales.
The concept of Meliola Fr. and related genera cannot be satisfac-
torily fixed in the system until more species have been investigated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Hypocreales, separated on color and texture alone, have
long been recognized as an artificial assemblage. The scoleco-
sporous forms with the ascus cap have been made the basis of
another order by Nannfeldt (l.c.), the Clavicipitales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The other large groups represented by species of Nectria Fr.,
Hypocrea Fr., and Hypomyces (Fr.) Tul. and their apparent rela-
tives, have not been studied sufficiently from the standpoint of their#Misc-exposition*]
[@MILLER: REVISION OF ASCOMYCETES 101#Misc-exposition*]

[@developmental histories to warrant either splitting them into fami-
lies or placing them with any other Pyrenomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Dothideales and Sphaeriales are also artificial groupings.
Species in which the locules lack separate walls and in which more
than one occurs in a stroma were placed in the former. If peri-
thecia with walls are produced, the species were placed in the
latter. If only one locule is present in a stroma, by interpretation
the species was placed in the Sphaeriales because this could not be
distinguished from a single perithecium with a wall.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Von Hóhnel (9, 10) first focussed attention on the centrum or
"nucleus" characters, and established the pseudosphaeriacous cen-
trum as opposed to the sphaeriacous centrum. The former was
distinguished by each ascus being in a separate locule formed of
interthecial stromal threads. In the Sphaeriales one finds free
paraphyses and no interthecial threads. This question has been
discussed at length by von Hóhnel (lc.) Theissen and Sydow
(29), Petrak (21), Nannfeldt (19), and the writer (16, 17, 18).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Saccardo's Sylloge Fungorum the limits of the families corre-
spond in large part to those of the orders or suborders, or in some
cases to the families, of the Engler und Prantl system. The chief
differences lie in the primary separations being based on spore
characters in the former as opposed to position of the ascocarp
relative to the substrate, amount of stroma, and other such artificial
characters in the latter. Of the two the Saccardo system seems to
bring together more closely related forms than the other system.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, the major groupings are open to the same criticism in
both.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PRESENT REVISION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The writer proposes suggestions for a revision of the fungi
previously placed in the Sphaeriales, the Dothideales, and the
Hypocreales, and demonstrates the changes in a key at the end of
this paper. His formerly expressed ideas as well as some of those
of von Hóhnel, Theissen and Sydow, Nannfeldt and others are
incorporated in these changes. In addition there are a few sug-
gestions for rearrangements in other orders. However, only sepa-
rations of orders and families are attempted, as it would now be#Misc-exposition*]
[@102 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@impossible to establish a complete revision, especially down to spe-
cies. This awaits the work of specialists in the groups.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Criteria of relationship are based on characters of the ontogeny,
as well as of the mature apothecial or perithecial centrum, and on
morphological characters of the ascus and ascospores. Such char-
acters as position of the ascocarp relative to the substrate, or color
or extent of stroma, are not considered fundamental and are ig-
nored in the keys.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Primitiveness is thought to consist of globose to oblong or widely
clavate asci, usually with a uniformly thickened wall, and opening
by splitting or gelatinization of the outer wall and elongation of
the inner, which in turn dissolves, freeing the spores. Also, the
asci are variously scattered on mycelium or rather irregularly
grouped in an ascocarp. Lastly, the asci arise following a union
of an archicarp with an antheridial hypha.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The high point in development would be exhibited by cylindrical
asci closely compacted in an ascocarp, usually with thin lateral
walls, much thickened at the apex, and opening by a pore or lid.
The asci here arise from a much branched ascogenous hyphal sys-
tem, following the union of free spermatia with the trichogyne of
an archicarp. The idea that spermatia and archicarps are pres-
ent, and then later ascogenous hyphae arise apogamously from
basal vegetative cells, could well have resulted from imperfect
cytological technique. In many cases it is practically impossilhle
to trace the connections between the asci and the archicarp with the
usual paraffin section method, but that doesn’t justify the conclu-
sion of apogamy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The writer has recognized these types of asci and ascocarp
centra#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. The globose or broadly clavate asci without a pore lie at irregu-
lar levels throughout loose or pseudoparenchymatous tissue
composed of ascogenous hyphae. As evolution proceeds
the asci are brought into one locule and each ascus grows
up into the stroma. The monascal locule partitions are
then the remnant stromal elements. These tendencies are
exhibited in the Plectomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. The clavate asci with no pore arise in a basal fascicle and in
growing upward dissolve out a stromal locule, ‘These are#Misc-exposition*]
[@MILLER: REVISION OF ASCOMYCETES 103#Misc-exposition*]

[@multi-ascal locules, with no interthecial threads. This is
the central tendency of the Dothideales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. The clavate to cylindrical asci with no pore arise from an entire
wall-layer in a stroma and grow upward between filiform
threads, which are connected at the top and bottom of the
locule. Following the presence of the archicarp there is
a fan-shaped array of deeply staining threads that grow
downward toward the base of the locule, ultimately appear-
ing as a palisade of vertical threads. Then the asci arise
from a position at their bases and grow up between them.
These threads are present before the asci arise and are here
designated as pseudoparaphyses. They are characteristic
of the Pseudosphaeriales, Microthyriales, Hysteriales, and
Lophiostomatales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. The clavate to cylindrical asci with a pore arise between apically -
free threads, which usually precede them in development.
This is the writer’s concept of paraphyses. The ascocarp
wall is a special structure developed from the basal cells of
the archicarp and is not part of the stroma. This type of
centrum is characteristic of the Sphaeriales and the Disco-
mycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5: “This type has been discovered by Luttrell (15) in Sphaerostilbe
aurantiicola of the Hypocreales. There is a true wall to
the perithecium and periphyses in the ostiole, but vertical
threads or pseudoparaphyses precede the asci as in the
Pseudosphaeriales. The asci are as in type 4. This is a
combination of types 3 and 4 in part. Should this prove
characteristic of many of the species of the Hypocreales it
would provide a 5th trend in Ascomycete development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HEMIASCOMYCETES#Misc-exposition*]
[@Endomycetales and Exoascales#Misc-exposition*]

[@These follow the usual pattern and apparently represent primi-
tiveness as well as simplicity. Nannfeldt (lc.) leaves the Exo-

Endomycetales coordinate with the Hemiasci (Dipodascaceae).

[@Miller: Revision Of Ascomycetes 105#Misc-exposition*]

[@EUASCOMYCETES#Misc-exposition*]

[@The old concept of asci in ascocarps is retained. Nannfeldt
(1.c.) divided this subclass into 1. Plectascales, 2. Ascoloculares,
and 3. Ascohymeniales. His Plectascales contain most of the
same groups as are found in the Plectascineae of the Pflanzen-
familien or the Plectascales of Gwynne-Vaughan and Barnes (8)
or Bessey (1) (sub Aspergillales), or Wolf and Wolf (l.c.) (sub
Eurotiales). His Ascoloculares and Ascohymeniales, however,
are new groupings. The former comprises all of the Pyreno-
mycetes with asci in locules, including even the Myriangiales and
Hysteriales. The Ascohymeniales on the other hand include forms
with a hymenium of asci and apically free paraphyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The writer thinks it preferable to keep the old separations of
Plectomycetes, Pyrenomycetes and Discomycetes with some modifi-
cations. For example, in Nannfeldt’s Ascoloculares there are at
least three ontogeneticalty different ascal locules; or the writer’s
types 1,2 and 3. In the Myriangiales the pseudoparenchymatous
locule tissue is composed of ascogenous hyphae and the asci tend
to he globose which places that order in the Plectomycetes. Then
in Nannfeldt’s Pseudosphaeriales he has the Pleospora-type with
connected threads between the asci, and the Dothidea-type with no
threads. Neither von Héhnel nor Theissen and Sydow distin-
guished between the monascus locule composed of the vertical
threads that are'in the centrum before the asci appear, and the
remnants of stromal elements due to the asci pushing up in the
stroma as in the higher Myriangiales, such as in Dothiora sub-
tropica (Wint.) Mill. & Burt. (FIG. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It appears more logical to retain the term Discomycete for the
Ascohymenial forms with exposed hymenium and Pyrenomycete
for those with inclosed asci. Then all of Nannfeldt’s forms in his
_Ascohymeniales with true perithecia should go in either the
Sphaeriales or Hypocreales. In his Ascoloculares forms with the
Dothidea-Mycosphaerella type of development should be placed in
the Dothideales, and those with the pseudosphaeriacous type in the
Pseudosphaeriales, Lophiostomatales, Hysteriales, or Microthyri-
ales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PLECTOMYCETES#Misc-exposition*]
[@Eurotiales, Myriangiales and Erysiphales#Misc-exposition*]

[@These are connected by the globose to semiglobose asci gener-
ally with uniformly thickened walls opening by the outer wall
splitting, and ascocarps with no paraphyses or other threads and
with no definite manner of opening (FIG. 2. Myriangium Duriaei
Mont. & Berk. and FIG. 4. Microsphaera Alni DC. ex Wint.).
The irregular arrangement of the asci, surrounded by ascogenous
hyphae, and the liberation of spores within the ascocarp are charac-
teristic except in the Erysiphales. In the latter the asci are typi-
cal, but in basal tufts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nannfeldt (1.c.) added the  Ophiostomataceae  (Ceratosto-
mataceae) and Chaetomiaceae to his Plectascales because of asci
with walls that deliquesce very early and liberate masses of spores
within the ascocarp. There are no interthecial threads. This
seems logical, but both groups are exceptions in possessing definite
ostioles. The asci of the Plectomycetes are usually formed on the
ends of hyphae or in chains, and ascus hooks are very rarely
present.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name Perisporiales is dropped because the order as delimited
by Lindau (6) in the Pflanzenfamilien comprises forms that are
now known to belong in several other orders. The most definite
and clear-cut group with well-known life histories is the Ery-
siphaceae, so the name is changed to the Erysiphales as is done
by Gwynne-Vaughan and Barnes (8). Not enough is known of
the developmental characters of the Meliolaceae to indicate their
affinities. According to Graff (7) there is an outer stroma he-
neath which the perithecium is hidden, with paraphyses and pe-
riphyses in an ostiole; however there is an oogonial and antheridial
stalk. The sex organs are similar to those of the Erysiphaceae,
but the centrum characters are apparently those of the Sphaeriales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In making identifications, if there is more than one perithecium
in the stroma, the presence or absence of a perithecial wall is suffi-
cient. The difficulty usually comes in separating forms with single
perithecia from uniloculate stromata, especially if one does not
have access to early stages. The character of the ascus should
separate these. If the ascus wall is apically thickened and pos-
sesses a pore, the fungus belongs in the Sphaeriales. If a pore is
lacking and the outer wall splits when the spores are ejected, the
fungus is a loculate form. An additional separation is that in the
Sphaeriales the ascus gives a blue reaction in iodine, a character
not present in the other orders.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CLAVICIPITACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@This family, with Claviceps Tul. as the type, constitutes a well
defined group. There is the very marked cap at the apex of the
long cylindric ascus (FIG. 8), and filiform spores that usually
break up into segments at maturity. The pore is very narrow
and penetrates the cap. The ascospores in ejection apparently do
not pass through the pore, but instead the entire cap is pushed off
and the spores extruded. The walls of the perithecia are pseudo-
prosenchymatous, and are sharply defined in all species studied.
The asci arise from a basal plectenchyma and never lie in a wall
layer as in members of the other families. Paraphyses and pe-
riphyses are formed, but deliquesce early in most species.#Misc-exposition*]

which is either stalked or sessile. All are parasites on grasses or
on insects.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nannfeldt (l.c.) makes this group an order, and separates it
from the rest of his Ascohymeniales by the lack of a special peri-
thecial wall.and paraphyses. This is at variance with findings of
the writer. Figures 6-7, Claviceps purpurea (Fr.) Tul. and fig-

agariciformia (Bolt.) Seaver) finds a true wall and ostiole and
paraphyses-like threads and periphyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Luttrell (15), in reviewing the literature of the Hypocreales,
mentions five types of development. His fourth type consisting of
poorly developed wall and no paraphyses, and including the Cordy-
ceps-Claviceps group, is hardly correct as there are walls and pa-
raphyses, or “paraphyses-like threads” as Jenkins calls them, at an
early stage. His fifth type, consisting of asci formed in locules in
a stroma with perithecial wall, ostiole and paraphyses lacking—
Epichloé typhina (Pers. ex Fr.) Tul., is also incorrect according
to the writer’s sections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@XYLARIACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is one of the oldest and best recognized groups of Asco-
mycetes. It consists of many genera and species widely scattered
throughout the world. The entire series constitutes an excellent
phylogenetic tree with few missing links. The members are pe-
culiarly susceptible to changes in color, size, and shape of the
stroma under variable environments, so the number of so-called
species in the literature has been tremendous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The perithecia have well defined pseudoprosenchymatous walls.
and are either single or many in a stroma. The asci are cylindric,
stalked, persistent, formed within a wall layer, possess a most pe-
culiar crown at the hase of the ascus pore, which ends in a wide
plug (see FIG. 9, Hypoxylon tinctor (Berk.) Cke. and rie, 10,
Xylaria Hypoxylon (L. ex Fr.) Grev.). Spores are ejected
through the pore into the perithecial neck and accumulate in black
masses just outside of the ostiole. These spores are uniseriate,
inequilaterally elliptical, 1-celled, dark colored, and have a longi-
tudinal germ pore. Paraphyses are copious, filiform, branched,
and persistent until late in the life of the perithecium, when they
gelatinize, especially up near the ostiole.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Small 1-celled conidia, or probably in some cases spermatia, are
borne on the surface of the stroma or in cavities.#Misc-exposition*]

crown nor pore, and has two-celled ascospores, which should ex-
clude it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ALLANTOSPHAERIACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@This family was created by von Höhnel (11) for all typical
Pyrenomycetes with allantoid ascospores. He divided the family
into four subgroups. One, the Diatrypeen v. Hóhn., possesses asci
located in a wall layer and which have a refractive ring. It belongs,
according to Nannfeldt (1.c.), in the Sphaeriales. Further, he has
included the genera Cryptosphacria Grev., Cryptovalsa (Ces. & De
Not.) Fekl., Diatrype Fr., Diatrypella (Ces. & De Not.) Sacc.,
Eutypa Tul, Eutypella (Nits.) Sacc, and Quatermaria Tul.
Nannfeldt (l.c.) sets this group up as a family, the Diatrypaceae,
and places it in the Sphaeriales. Wehmeyer (30) and also Wolf

cept of Wehmeyer (l.c.) for the family, except for the genus
Anthostoma, which the writer places in the Xylariaceae because
of the crown in the ascus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DIAPORTHACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@This group was first delimited by von Hóhnel (10) to comprise
forms with his “diaportheen nucleus." Nannfeldt (lc.) erected
an order, the Diaporthales, coordinate with the Sphaeriales. Pur-
ther, he placed the forms with allantoid spores but with the dia-
portheen centrum in another order, the Valsales. The writer re-
tains essentially the von Hóhnel grouping, or the more recent con-
cept of Wehmeyer (30), without limiting it to forms on wood or
bark.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The characters of the family consist of perithecia usually with
long necks, one or more in a stroma or pseudostroma, or in no
recognizable stroma, with rounded ostioles, not suleate, — Asci are
in a wall layer, clavate, short-stalked, thin-walled except at the
apex and that is very thick, penetrated by a pore containing a light-
refractive ring, at maturity free from base and becoming loose in
the perithecial centrum, completely filling it. In most cases spore
ejection is through the pore, but sometimes the wall of the ascus
dissolves and the spores collect in a gelatinous mass at the apex.
Paraphyses are at an early stage seen as broad, free pointed, bands
interspersed with some narrow filiform ones. The entire mass
gelatinizes at maturity. .#Description*]

locules in a stroma. They vary in shape and color as much as

[@PHYLLACHORACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@This family has historically been placed in the Dothideales hy
Lindau (6), Stevens (25), and Theissen and Sydow (27). The
type of the family is Phyllachora Nits., and of the genus Ph.
graminis (Pers. ex Fr.) Fckl. The latter was supposed to have
contained no true perithecia, but instead locules in a flat stroma
sunken in the leaf (see Stevens [25], fig. 157). This concept was
refuted by Orton (20), who showed that each perithecium con-
tained a special wall, and that the blackened hyphae which form
the clypeus arise in the epidermis or cuticle of the leaf as lateral
proliferations of the ostiolar tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

times with a clypeus formed by the lateral proliferation of ostiolar
hyphae. Asci persistent in a wall layer, cylindric, very short
stalked, with walls fairly uniform in thickness, not especially thick-
ened at apex, with wide pore in center of apex, blue with iodine.
Ascospores uniseriate. Paraphyses copious, persistent, filiform,
and branched.#Description*]

[@This group contains at present only the genus Phyllachora.
Whether other genera should be included depends on a thorough
study of forms placed in the family by Theissen and Sydow (27)
and others. Their separation of the old genus into several based
on position of the fructification in the leaf does not seem to have
merit.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nannfeldt (l.c.) places Phyllachora in a family, the Polystig-
mataceae, which is based on Polystigma rubrum (Pers. ex Fr.)
Chev. This forms a solid fleshy stroma with sunken perithecia in
the leaf.’ The perithecia mature only after overwintering in the
dead leaf. Whether this form should be placed in the same family
with Phyllachora would depend on the results of more study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phyllachora species on grasses in the genera Andropogen L.,
Elymus L., Panicum L. and Triodia R. Br. have been studied by
the writer, and they possess a true wall. At an early stage they
show free paraphyses and asci growing into an inclosed hollow.

[@(4) say that the Hypocreales are distinguished from the Dothide-
ales by the presence of a distinct perithecial wall and fleshy bright
colored perithecia. They make the group a family and place it in
the Sphaeriales. The writer (18) has done the same thing in the
past. However, in view of recent knowledge this may have been
- a mistake, except for the Clavicipitaceae. There are other large
groups such as species of Neciria Fr., Hypomyces (Fr.) Tul,
Hypocrea Fr., and others whose life histories have not been studied
sufficiently to accurately judge their relationships. It is possible
that there are other characters that would prevent this alignment
in the Sphaeriales. For example, Luttrell (15) has made a very
detailed study of Sphaerostilbe aurantiicola (Berk. & Br.) Petch
and he finds that there is a true perithecial wall and a periphysate
ostiole, but no paraphyses, and there are vertical threads or pseudo-
paraphyses attached in the roof. Here, then, are wall and ostiole
characters of the Sphaeriales combined with centrum characters of
the Pseudosphaeriales. Luttrell also finds the vertical hyphae in
Nectria cinnabarina Tode ex Fr. and records similar conditions in
Nectria Ribis and Hypocrea gelatinosa (Creopus gelatinosus (Tode
ex Fr.) Lk.). The writer finds this centrum in Nectria cinna-
barina, Creopus gelatinosus, Nectria ochroleuca (Schw.) Curt.,
Nectria coccinea Pers. ex Fr., Nectria galligena Bres., Thyro-
nectria austro-americana (Speg.) Seeler, Hypocrea lenta (Tode
ex Fr.) Berk. and Br. and Hypomyces lactifluorum (Schw. ex
Fr.) Tul.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The presence of the vertical threads has evidently been over-
looked in Hypomyces, Hypocrea, and Podostroma Sacc. Both
Lindau (6) and Clements and Shear (4) state paraphyses lack-
ing for these genera. In other cases, these threads have been
called paraphyses.#Misc-exposition*]

centrum of the Pseudosphaeriales. At present all forms with free
paraphyses should be removed to the Sphaeriales, and those with
asci in pseudoparenchyma to the Dothideales, and those with the
vertical threads but no wall to the Pseudosphaeriales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DOTHIDEALES#Misc-exposition*]

[@In revising this group no change is necessary in the original con-
cept of the type. The name came originally from Dothidea Fr.,
and Dothidea Sambuci Fr. is the type of the genus. This species
is not the first one described, but it is the element with which the
name has been permanently associated, and it fixes the generic
name, and also the family and ordinal names as commonly applied.
Theissen and Sydow (27) did not have sufficient basis to change
this name to Systremma Th. & Syd.#Misc-exposition*]
[@The present idea, then, is in reality the very old one of ascus
locules in a stroma with no special wall, and each locule, as in
Dothidea Sambuci, contains a persistent fascicle of asci with no
interthecial threads. The locule opens by a lycigenously formed
pore in the stromal wall. This concept is emended to include
uniloculate forms with this centrum. The ascus is uniformly
thickened and opens as in the Pseudosphaeriales hy the outer wall
splitting and the inner protuding. (See Wolf and Wolf 32: fig.
80.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Theissen and Sydow (29) place the uniloculate stromata such
as in Mycosphaerella Johans. in the Pseudosphaeriales, but as
pointed out previously the interthecial tissue is ontogenetically dit-
ferent in the two concepts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the group as monographed by Theissen and Sydow (27) the
Phyllachoraceae go in the Sphaeriales and all forms with pseudo-
paraphyses, such as Auerswaldiclla puccinioides (Speg.) Th. &

the writer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@At present one could arbitrarily separate the group into two

time ago, and there is the more recent discussion by Nannfeldt

[@Previously the writer has thought that the threads (see FIG. 22)
in the centrum attached at top and bottom were remnants of
stromal tissue in process of dissolution by developing asci. Since
then sections of young stages of many species have shown the
presence of these threads before the asci even begin to form. , The
archicarp first develops in the stroma, followed by a fan-like down-
ward growth of threads from the position of the archicarp. Then
as the stroma develops the threads elongate and asci arise at their
bases, The connection between these vertical threads and the asci
has never been satisfactorily explained. Sartoris and Kauffman
(23) and Cavara and Mollica (3) thought the young asci were
formed in the threads. Dodge (5) with a Leptosphaeria and
Wehmeyer (31) with a Pseudotrichia thought there was no con-
nection with the asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This stage in the ontogeny has not been found in the group de-

ejection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE “DUAL PHENOMENON” AND TRI-
CHOPHYTON MENTAGROPHYTES *#Misc-exposition*]

[@William J. Robbins AND Ilda McVeigh#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wilhelm (3) has applied the concept of "dual phenomenon"
developed by Snyder and Hansen to the dermatophytes. He as-
sumes that a species of a dermatophyte is composed of races and
each race is dual, that is, composed of two distinct constituents as-
sociated together in culture. One constituent produces conidia in
abundance but relatively scanty mycelium; this he designates as
the C or conidial constituent. The other produces fewer conidia
but more abundant mycelium; this he designates as the M or
mycelial constituent. The M type, he says, arises as a mutation
in old cultures of the C type even though the culture is started
from a single conidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to the C and M constituents, a “race” of a dermato-
phyte may give rise to forms culturally intermediate between C
and M. Wilhelm suggests that in old cultures the mycelium and
spores become heterocaryotic with respect to C and M nuclei.
The variation exhibited upon single spore analysis of these old
cultures results from chance separation of nuclear types in the
spores at the time they are formed. He concludes that the nor-
mal and pleomorphic forms of Trichophyton mentagrophytes pic-
tured by Robbins and McVeigh (2) may he considered respec-
tively as C and M types.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We interpret Wilhelm’s suggestion to mean “that given a race of
a dermatophyte in the conidial form, the following occurs: The
conidial type, C, mutates and forms the mycelial type, M. Hetero-
caryosis occurs between the C and M, that is, mycelium develops#Misc-exposition*]

[@1 This investigation was supported in part by a grant from the American
Cancer Society recommended by the National Research Council Committee
on Growth. The assistance of Anita Rolnick in the spore isolations is
gratefully acknowledged.#Misc-exposition*]

[@128#Misc-exposition*]
[@Robbins and McVeigh: “Dual Phenomenon” 129#Misc-exposition*]

[@containing both C and M nuclei; this form is intermediate in char-
acter between the C type and the M type. If single spore isola-
tions are made from the C type, only C is obtained because only
C nuclei were present. Similarly, only M. is obtained from M.
However, single spore isolations from intermediate forms, CM,
yield the conidial type, the mycelial type, and, in addition, inter-
mediates if the spores isolated are multinucleate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our experience with the variants which occur in older cultures
of T. mentagrophytes has led us to doubt that the concept of a
“dual phenomenon” supplemented with heterocaryosis and the
separation of nuclei is an adequate explanation for the occurrence
and characteristics of the variants which can be isolated from old
cultures of this fungus. In the first place, the number of variants
which can be isolated from a single “race” appears to us to be
greater than can be accounted for by heterocaryosis. In the second
place, we have found that the variants can be maintained indefi-
nitely in culture provided transfers are made to fresh media at
relatively short intervals—a week or thereabouts. If any of the
variants isolated from old cultures of T. mentagrophytes were
heterocaryotic, we would scarcely anticipate that they could be
maintained in culture without evidencing nuclear separation since
many of them form spores freely before subcultures are made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The application of the concept of “dual phenomenon” to T.
mentagrophytes was tested experimentally by isolating nine vari-
ants from an original conidial culture which had been obtained
from a human subject. Colonies of the nine variants and the
original form grown on peptone agar and asparagine agar are
shown in figure 1. They ranged from a highly mycelial rapidly-
growing form which produced conidia slowly to highly conidial
slow-growing forms. Since these variants were obtained from
old cultures of the conidial form on which pleomorphic colonies
had developed, ‘it would seem justifiable to assume that some of
the isolations were intermediates, as defined by Wilhelm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Each of the ten isolations was maintained at approximately
35° C. on peptone agar by making transfers to fresh media at short
intervals. Single spore isolations from each were made by spread-
ing spores thinly on the surface of an agar plate. After one or#Misc-exposition*]
[@130 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@two days incubation, individual microconidia which had begun to
germinate were selected (using a binocular or the lower power of
a compound microscope), and transferred to tubes. Comparisons
were made of the resulting colonies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A description of the origin of each of the isolations and their
general characteristics, together with the results obtained on isola-
tions of single microconidia, is given below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several media were used as follows. Asparagine-peptone
agar contained per liter 50.0 g. dextrose, 1.5 g. KH3PO,, 0.5 g.
MgSO,°7H2O, 1500 mp moles thiamine, 2.0 g. asparagine, 1.0 g.
neopeptone, 0,5 mi. mixture of mineral supplements (1), and
15.0 g. agar. Peptone agar was prepared as above except that it
contained 2.0 g. per liter of neopeptone and no asparagine. As-
paragine agar was the same as the asparagine-peptone agar with
peptone omitted. Ammonium nitrate agar was identical with the
asparagine-peptone agar except 2.0 g. of NH4NOs was substituted
for the asparagine and peptone. The pH of these media ranged
between 5.0 and 5.6.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The morphology of the colony, pigment production, conidial
formation and microscopic character of a particular isolate are
affected by the composition of the medium and by the temperature
and time of incubation. In our experience, the distinctions be-
tween isolates, at least so far as colony appearance is concerned,
are sharper if the medium is not too rich. We have, therefore,
made our comparisons on media containing relatively small
amounts of nitrogen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The (N) form#Misc-exposition*]

[@T. mentagrophytes was originally isolated from a human sub-
ject in August, 1942. It was a freely sporulating form with sparse
mycelial growth corresponding to the condial type described by
Wilhelm. We have referred to this as the normal (N) strain. A
single spore culture was made and maintained in a Ireely sporulat-
ing condition up to April 24, 1947, on asparagine-peptone agar by
subculturing to fresh media at intervals which did not exceed two
weeks. Since the date given, it has been maintained on peptone
agar by transferring at weekly intervals to fresh media,#Misc-exposition*]
[@Robbins and McVeigh: “Dual PHENOMENON” 131#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic examinations of cultures of (N) grown on peptone
agar at 35° C. made at the end of one and two weeks, showed the
mycelium to be variable; both slender and wide hyphae occurred.
Microconidia were numerous in one week. Chains of chlamydo- .
spores were common. No macroconidia were observed in two
weeks on this medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The (N) form grows slowly on an asparagine medium, more
rapidly on peptone. Little or no growth occurs with NH,NO; as
source of nitrogen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When single spore isolations were made from the (N) form,
they developed into (N) cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In February, 1946, sixty single spore isolations from a young
culture of (N) were made to asparagine-peptone medium. Sub-
cultures of each isolation were made to NH4NOs agar. The isola-
tions on asparagine-peptone agar were indistinguishable when ex-
amined after seven and nine days, and those on NH,NOs gave
characteristic response for (N) on that medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On May 3, 1948, sixty-nine single spore isolations were made
to peptone agar from a three-day old (N) culture which had
grown on peptone agar at 35° C. All proved to be identical in
appearance when examined after ten days. Subcultures of each
isolation were made after four days to an asparagine medium. All
appeared to be alike after six days growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@If cultures of the (N) strain are allowed to age, variants de-
velop which can be distinguished by rate of growth, morphology
of colony, pigment production, microscopic appearance and physio-
logical characteristics. Some of these have been described earlier
(1, 2). Although no particular effort has been made to discover
how many variants could be isolated, it is our impression that they
would be considerable in number—fifty or more. In any event,
those which we have isolated have been maintained in culture ap-
parently unchanged over considerable periods by transferring to
fresh media at intervals of a week or thereabouts.#Misc-exposition*]

maintained in culture for over three years.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In February, 1946, forty-six single spore isolations of (B) were
made to asparagine-peptone agar. Subcultures of each of the
isolations were made to NH4NOsz agar. All isolations on peptone
agar appeared to be alike, and the subcultures to NHyNOs, agar
were indistinguishable one from another.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On May 5, 1948, sixty-five single spore isolations were made
from a thirteen-day old culture of (B) to a peptone medium, and
subcultures were made from each isolation after six days to an
asparagine medium. Examinations made up to twelve days on
the peptone and six days on the asparagine medium showed all
isolations to be indistinguishable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The (B) form is the most rapidly growing form we have iso-
lated. On peptone and asparagine agar it produces a thick, white,
fluffy colony. It is able to use NH4NOs though growth is less
rapid than with asparagine or peptone.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic examination of cultures grown at 35° C. on the
peptone medium were made at the end of one, two, three and four
weeks. At the end of one week, the hyphae were slender and
uniform in width. No micro- or macroconidia and no chlamydo-
spores were observed. A few hyphae had swollen tips. On the
older cultures, some thicker hyphae were noted and some of the
slender hyphae developed thickened portions, but no chains of
chlamydospores were found. A few microconidia had developed
by the end of two weeks and the number increased until they were
numerous after four weeks. A few macroconidia were observed
in cultures four weeks old.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The (A) variant#Misc-exposition*]

[@A mycelial type was isolated from a pleomorphic colony on a
plate inoculated with (N). A single spore isolation was made .
and the resulting culture labeled (A). It was less vigorous than

peptone agar. After seven or eight days, transfers were made to

made from the peptone cultures to an asparagine medium. One
week later all cultures looked alike. None resembled (N) or (B).#Misc-exposition*]

[@On April 29, 1948, fifty-six single spore isolations were made to
peptone agar from an (A) culture which had grown seven days at

fourteen days. Transfers were made to asparagine agar from
each isolation after six days on peptone agar. When examined six
days later, all cultures looked alike.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Variant (6224)#Misc-exposition*]

[@A mass isolation was made from a pleomorphic area appearing
on an agar plate nine days after inoculation with a spore suspension
from a seven-day-old culture of (N). This was labeled (6a) and
thirty-six single spore isolations were made on peptone agar. All
of these appeared alike after eleven days. One of these isolations,
(6a24), was selected for further study. On May 10, 1948, sixty-
five single spore isolations of (6a24) were made from a four-day-
old culture to peptone agar and after four days, subcultures of each
were made to an asparagine agar. Observations made after eleven
days growth on the peptone agar indicated that all of these cultures
were alike in gross morphology. The subcultures on the aspara-
gine medium appeared alike after one week.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic examination showed that this isolation resembled
form (B) in being composed of slender hyphae. However, in the
production of conidia (6a24) resembled the (N) form. Micro-
conidia were very numerous in a culture grown on peptone agar
for one week. Chains of chlamydospores were uncommon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopically, (6a24) on peptone agar was much like the (A)
and the (B) form. It consisted of a rapidly spreading, thick, aerial
mycelium. Its growth characteristics on an asparagine medium,
however, were different from those of any of the forms studied.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Robbins AND McVeigh: “DuaL PHENOMENON” 135#Misc-exposition*]

[@On this medium, it formed a small central area of heavy mycelium
with a wide area of sparse subsurface mycelium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Variant (7a38)#Misc-exposition*]

[@A mass isolation from a pleomorphic colony appearing on a
plate originally inoculated with a seven-day-old culture of (N)
was labeled (7a). The cultures which developed from thirty-two
single spore isolations made on peptone agar were of two types.
Both types were faster growing and less powdery than the (N)
form. They resembled the (A) and (B) forms in being fluffy.
One type produced considerable yellow pigment in the peptone
agar and formed a small powdery area at the upper area of the
slant. Twenty-one of the isolations were of this type, and a single
one, (7a38), was selected for further study. The remaining eleven
isolations were fluffy over the entire surface and developed little
or no pigment. This type spread less rapidly than the first de-
scribed. One of this form, (7214), was reserved for further study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On May 6, 1948, seventy single spore isolations were made from
a six-day-old culture of (7a38) to a peptone medium. Minor dif-
ferences in pigmentation and colony size were noted when the cul-
tures were first observed. Observations after eleven days showed
all to be of one type. Subcultures of each of the isolations were
made to asparagine agar five days after isolation. On the aspara-
gine medium, all were alike after six days.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopically, (7a38) resembled the (N) form. The my-
celium was composed of both slender and wide hyphae. Both
microconidia and chains of chlamydospores were present in a week-
old culture. The conidia were numerous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(7a38) on plates of peptone agar was intermediate between the
(N) and (B) forms in appearance. It formed a heavier growth

[@A strongly conidial type, slower growing than (N), was iso-

oculated from a seven-day culture of (N) and incubated for fifty-
four days at 35° C. Evident pleomorphisms had developed on
this plate. A spore suspension was made and plated on aspara-
gine-peptone agar. Three types of colonies developed—namely,
pleomorphic forms, (N) forms, and some slower growing than
(N). An isolation was made May 1, 1946, from one of the slow-
growing colonies and labeled (D). A single spore isolation was
made from (D) and Jabeled (D1). This variant has been main-
tained in culture to date by making transfers to fresh media at
seven-day intervals. On May 5, 1948, seventy-eight single spore
isolations were made to peptone from a five-day-old (D1) culture
growing on peptone agar. All seventy-eight isolations proved to
be identical in gross morphological appearance when examined
after twelve days. After six days on peptone, transfers from each
of the seventy-eight isolations were made to asparagine agar. All
were identical in appearance when examined after six days incu-
bation. When first examined, six of the subcultures on aspara-
gine agar appeared slightly more fluffy than the balance. Trans-
fers of these six and some of the other seventy-two were made to
peptone agar and were found to be indistinguishable. We con-
cluded that all the single spore isolations of (D1) were alike.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seemed to us that the concept of the “dual phenomenon,” as
we interpret its application by Wilhelm to dermatophytes, could
be tested by selecting a number of variants which had developed in
old cultures of the condial form of a “race” of T. mentagrophytes.
Evidence on the existence of heterocaryosis and nuclear separation
could be obtained by comparing cultures derived by single spore
isolations from young cultures of these variants.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since our strain of T. mentagrophytes was isolated from a hu-
man subject and developed from a single microconidium, we con-
sidered it to be a single “race.” The variants were all obtained
from this “race.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some of the variants selected were intermediate between the ex-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Robbins and McVeigh: “Dual Phenomenon” 139#Misc-exposition*]

[@treme mycelial type and the pronounced conidial form in growth
habit, conidial production and microscopic appearance. We con-
sidered that at least some, if not all, of these would be intermedi-
ates in Wilhelm’s meaning and therefore heterocaryotic. If this
assumption were correct, then both the mycelial and conidial types
would be obtained by single spore isolations from these intermedi-
ates. If the spores isolated were uninucleate, these two types
only would be observed. If the spores or other reproductive bodies
were multinucleate, a few of the conidial and a few of the mycelial
types might be expected, but various kinds of intermediates, de-
pending upon the relative proportions of C and M nuclei in the
spores isolated, would predominate. Young cultures only could
be used for single spore isolations because of the possibility that
mutants had developed in the older cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our results were entirely negative. In no instance did we ob-
tain a conidial or a mycelial type from the microconidia isolated
from young cultures of forms which appeared to be intermediate
between the two types. In every instance the cultures which grew
from single microconidia were indistinguishable from the parent.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The number of conidia from each isolation with which we dealt
was not large. We believe, however, that it was sufficiently large
to detect nuclear separation, though too small to discover spon-
taneous mutants which might be assumed to occur at the rate of
1 to 10,000 or of that order.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems unlikely that Wilhelm’s suggestion is adequate to ex-
plain the variants which develop from a single strain of T. menta-
grophytes. If the variants with which we worked were derived
from multinucleate spores, we should have observed nuclear sepa-
ration. If they originated from spores which were uninucleate,
they should have been either conidial or mycelial but not inter-
mediate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We are of the opinion that the variants which develop, as cul-
tures of T. mentagrophyies age, are mutations, though whether the
change is cytoplasmic or nuclear cannot be determined because of
the absence of a sexual stage.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE SWARM-CELLS OF MYXOMYCETES#Misc-exposition*]

[@EUGENE W. Elliott#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 25 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Germination of spores of a species of myxomycete was first re-
ported by deBary (1) in 1854. He observed that the spores of
Hemitrichia Vesparium+ produced a flagellated swarm-cell rather
than the hyphal tube characteristic of the higher fungi, with which
the Myxomycetes were then classified. Subsequently deBary (3,
4) attempted to germinate spores of a number of species, meeting
with varying success. He obtained no germination of spores of
the Cribrarias and the Tubiferas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since deBary’s first report, many students of the Myxomycetes
have attempted to germinate a large number of forms and have
invariably met with the same inconsistencies which deBary found.
Durand (13) attempted to germinate several species, succeeding
only with Enteridium Rozeanum.  McClatchie (43), reading of
Durand’s low results, replied with a statement that he and his
students never failed to obtain good germination with spores of
Reticularia Lycoperdon whether the collections were fresh or a
year old. He germinated five other species with varying results,
but always obtained swarm-cells within three hours except in
Hemitrichia Vesparium, which produced only myxamoebae. Lister
(40) found that repeated drying and rewetting of cultures facili-
tated the germination of a species of Badhamia. Jahn (29) used
this method to obtain germination of Stemonitis axtfera after previ-
ous culturing had failed, and later (30) used it to obtain germina-
tion—in very low numbers, to be sure—of Tubifera ferruginosa
and Lindbladia effusa. Both of these belong to families with
which deBary had had no success. All reports since Jahn’s con-
firm deBary's experience with these two species. F. A. Gilbert
(21) made a comparative study of spore germination by families.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1 Nomenclature throughout this paper follows the classification according

to Martin (42). Where current names differ from those used by the authors
of the papers cited, the synonomy is given in the appendix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@141#Misc-exposition*]
[@142 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@He included reports in the literature as well as results obtained
with his own collections of fifty-six species. He reports that all
of the Reticulariaceae germinated very well, and that the Tubiferas
had not ever been germinated, apparently overlooking Jahn’s re-
port. He found that in the other families tested “germinative
ability appears to differ with the genera and species.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Studies of the factors influencing spore germination have brought
out many points but have left many others to be clarified. Mc-
Clatchie reported a higher percentage of germination in Reticularia
Lycoperdon one year old than in fresh collections. Gilbert re-
ported no germination of Lycogala less than one month alter fruit-
ing, but good germination of older material, He found that fresh
collections of Leocarpus fragilis germinated only after two and a
half days in culture while older spores germinated in twelve hours.
E. C. Smith (55) germinated twenty-one collections ranging from
five to thirty-two years old and found no correlation between the
ages of his collections and their percentages of germination. Other
workers have observed improvement of germination with aging
within relatively short limits of time. Gilbert regarded the aging
of the spores as important in their maturation and listed this as
one of the most important factors governing germination. He also
referred to “internal factors” varying from species to species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smart (52) studied the influence of some external factors on
the germination of about seventy species. He found that most
forms germinate better, though usually little better, in decoctions
of their natural substrata than in distilled or tap water. The
optimum temperature for all forms studied was between 22° and
30? C., most forms doing better near 30° C. than at lower tempera-
tures. The optimum pli ranged from 4.5 to 7.0, most forms
germinating most readily near neutrality. It is important to note
that the variation in percentage germination of any given species
resulting from variation of any one factor is less than the differ-
ences in percentage germination among the various species even
though all factors be optimum for each species. In other words,
Smart’s intensive study of external factors serves to bring out the
point that the factors he studied are of less importance in spore
germination than some other factor or factors not yet discovered.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several workers have stressed the necessity of stirring the spores#Misc-exposition*]
[@ELLIOTT: SWARM-CELLS OF MYXOMYCETES 143#Misc-exposition*]

[@into the culture solution to assist in wetting. Cayley (9) used
alcohol as a wetting agent to increase germination of spores of
Didymium nigripes. Smart (52) disinfected spores with mercuric
chloride or hexylresorcinol, followed hy washing with centrifuging
and final culturing in distilled water. Though his objective was
reduction of bacteria, probably the manipulation had considerable
wetting action, and many of the side effects which he observed
might be attributable to increased numbers of spores thoroughly
wetted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gilbert (18) and Smith (54) both reported that approximately
half of the species which they observed produced more than one
swarm-cell per spore. Gilbert observed the production of one,
two, or four protoplasts from spores of Leocarpus fragilis, and
Smith states that he observed four protoplasts escape from each of
hiity spores of Badhamia affinis before seeing a single protoplast
emerge from one spore. Howard (26) says spores of Physarum
polycephalum may produce one or two swarm-cells, and Heitz-
manowna (24) observed “one to several” swarm-cells produced by
spores of Did ymium nigripes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures of swarm-cells of Myxomycetes are ordinarily con-
taminated by bacteria, and usually hy any or all of several species
of protozoa. DeBary pictures a protozoan with a flagellum at each
end among his swarm-cells. Durand observed this same form and
considered it an abnormal form of swarm-cell characteristic of
Enteridium Roseanum. Pinoy (45, 46) considered certain bac-
teria and protozoa necessary for germination and development of
Myxomycetes and even postulated that the protozoan cysts are in-
corporated into myxomycete fructifications. Gilbert studied the
hipolar flagellate and reported it as Cercomonas longicauda.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anteriorly biflagellate swarm-cells have been observed as oc-
curring occasionally in Myxomycetes by many observers, but it
has been generally held that the swarm-cells in this group are nor-
mally uniflagellate. DeBary (4) in 1884 and Vouk (58) in 1911
reported biflagellate forms in exceptional cases only. Gilbert (16)
found one-fourth of the swarm-cells of Stemonitis fusca biflagel-
late. Von Stosch (56) saw biflagellate cells in many other spe-
cies, but none in the single species of Stemonitis which he studied.
Gilbert (17) reported Dictydiaethalium plumbeum to be uniflagel-#Misc-exposition*]

[@144 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@late, but E. C. Smith (54, 55) twice within the following year pub-
lished photomicrographs showing biflagellate swarm-cells in the
same species. Howard (26) termed biflagellate swarm-cells in
Physarum polycephalum “common.” Sinoto and Yuasa (49)
studied Ceratiomyxa and four species of Myxogastres, finding only
one flagellum in Cerationyxa, but occasional bi- and even tri-flagel-
late forms in all of the others. Yuasa (60) likewise found bi- and
tri-flagellate cells in Fuligo septica. Jahn (31) in 1928 ignored
the previous reports of biflagellate swarm-cells, and in 1936 (32)
he criticized the work of Von Stosch, insisting that swarm-cells are
normally uniflagellate and that all biflagellate swarm-cells are
anomalies. Karling (35), in his general summary of the litera-
_ture pertinent to the relationships between the Plasmodiophorales
and the Myxomycetes, says, “. . . although the majority are uni-
flagellate, zoospores with two flagella are not uncommon. .. .”
In 1945 Ellison (15) reported biflagellate swarm-cells in propor-
tions varying from two per cent to twenty-six per cent for a num-
ber of species of Myxomycetes but retained the assumption that
the majority are uniflagellate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is not inconceivable that an occasional biflagellate swarm-cell
could occur as an abnormality in an otherwise uniflagellate group.
But biflagellation has already been reported too frequently in the
Myxomycetes to represent meie abnormality. And on the basis
of flagellation as reported in other groups, it is very unlikely that
both uniflagellate and biflagellate forms would normally exist in the
same life stage of the Myxomycetes. It seems more probable that
the second, shorter, flagellum is difficult to see and is frequently
hidden.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The purposes of this study were to find a means of improving
germination in witro of myxomycete spores, and to study the
swarm-cells thus produced in an etfort to determine whether an-
terior hiflagellation is not the rule rather than the exception.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first cultures were prepared in September, 1946, using
Reticularia Lycoperdon (Coll. no. 16, above), Lycogala epiden-
drum (no. 14), and Trichia affinis (no. 37). Abundant germina-
tion was obtained in the first attempts with R. Lycoperdon and
T. affinis, but only one of several cultures of L. epidendrum was
observed to germinate. Repeated attempts to germinate cultures
of the two oldest collections of Enteridium Roseanum (nos. 10 and
11) resulted in the observation of occasional swarm-cells in no. 10,
but only very low percentages of germination. Other species gave
similar results.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures were made in Syracuse watch glasses using distilled
water from which the traces of toxic minerals were removed with
powdered charcoal. It was observed that most of the spores
placed in the culture dish continued to float on the surface of the
water, never becoming wet. This was especially true of those
forms having very small spores, such as Enteridium and Lycogala.
Various wetting agents were tried in an attempt to accelerate the
wetting and increase the germination of these spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alcohol was the first wetting agent tested. Cayley (9) used
20% alcohol for wetting spores of Didymium sp., securing approxi-
mately 50% germination whether the spores were in the alcohol
“a few minutes” or a full hour. Also she used a solution of 0.2%
mercuric chloride in a mixture of equal parts of 95% alcohol and
water, as a combined wetting agent and bactericide. The result-
ing cultures were not bacteria-free and germination was poor.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the tests here reported a number of different dilutions of
alcohol were tried, 95% being the strongest and 20% the weakest
concentration used. Lower concentrations had negligible wetting
effect. After wetting, spores were washed three times with cen-
trifuging and cultured as before. No germination was obtained#Misc-exposition*]

[@Trisodium phosphate was tried next. By experimentation it
was found that spores of Enteridium Rozeanum, which has the
smallest spores of any species used up to the time of these tests,
would sink immediately in a 0.5% solution and slowly in a 0.2%
solution. In preparing cultures using trisodium phosphate as a
detergent, washing was done as when alcohol was the wetting
agent. Cultures of E. Rozeanum (no. 11), prepared with the use
of trisodium phosphate in either 0.5% or 0.2% solution, germinated

[@Trisodium phosphate in 0.5%. sulution was used as a detergent
in preparation of cultures of a number of other collections. Abun-
dant germination was produced occasionally in Lycogala epiden-
drum (no. 14), but no consistent germination was secured with
any species except. E. Roseamum; hence toxic effects were sus-
pected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the search for an active detergent without toxic effects, two
commercial detergents, “Soilax” and “Dreft,” were tried, both in
0.5% solution. Both acted as effective wetting agents, but many
spores were caught in the foam on the “Dreft” solution and could
not be reclaimed by centrifuging. Germination in cultures thus
prepared was similar to, and no more satisfactory than, that ob-
tained with trisodium phosphate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fact that bile salts greatly lower the surface tension of sulu-
tions, as exemplified in the Hay test for bile in urine (23), inspired
the testing of solutions of sodium glycocholate and sodium tauro-
cholate as wetting agents for preparation of cultures. It was found
that either the glycocholate or the taurocholate will wet the spores
satisfactorily in 196 solution, but lower concentrations act so slowly
as to be. inadequate. In equal concentrations, these two salts, or
a mixture of them, are equally effective as wetting agents.#Misc-exposition*]

[@nated more quickly and in greater percentage when previously
wetted with the bile salts. Of course, the spores of two different
collections of the same species frequently show greatly different
percentages of germination. When the bile salts are used, other
conditions being equal, the differences are substantially reduced.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Germination of spores directly in 1%. solution of the bile salts
was tried. Protoplasts emerged from the spore cases, but devel-
oped no further. However a technique was developed in which
only one washing with water is necessary to free wetted spores of
the detergent. Approximately 1 cc. of the wetting agent is placed
in a centrifuge tube and the spores to be cultured are added and
stirred until wetted, a process which usually takes one-half minute.
Then the solution is diluted to 5 or 6 cc. with water and promptly
centrifuged. The spores are then washed once with distilled water
hy centrifuging, and are finally cultured in distilled water prepared
with charcoal as described above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The wetting efficiency and the low toxicity of the “Aerosols”
recommend them for the purpose of preparing cultures of myxo-
mycete spores. It was hoped that the toxicity of an aerosol solu-
tion would be negligible and that a dilution might be found which
would be effective in wetting and of such a nature that germination
could take place directly in the detergent. As before, spores of
Enteridium Rozeanum were used as the test organism, and it was
found that considerable wetting effect was obtained in solutions as
weak as 0.1 ppm. Germination was obtained in solutions as strong
as 1000 ppm., the highest percentage of germination in these tests
being at 1 ppm. However, when Reticularia Lycoperdon was
tested in the same dilutions, no germination was obtained in solu-
tions stronger than 1 ppm., and very few swarm-cells were found
in solutions stronger than 0.1 ppm. No germination was obtained
in aerosol solutions with any of several other forms which were
tried, though germination was obtained with all of them in cultures
prepared at the same time using the bile salts as described above.
Many protoplasts, escaped from the spore cases, were observed to
disintegrate explosively in solutions stronger than 1 ppm. in all
cultures except those of Enteridium Rozeanum. However, germi-
nation was obtained in the two forms mentioned above, and the#Misc-exposition*]
[@152 MyvcoroctA, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@swarm-cells remained alive in the flagellated form for much longer
than was ever observed in cultures prepared otherwise. It is con-
cluded, therefore, that the chemical toxicity of the aerosols is not
an important factor, but that the surface tension of the culture solu-
tion is of considerable importance. Probably a solution of aerosol
could have been used in place of the bile salts solution, with the
same washing technique. But since washing would obviate the
only advantage of using aerosol, the bile salts were continued, for
the sake of uniformity of results.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alternate wetting and drying, tried on several cultures, gave
no noticeable improvement in any case except that of Physarum
flavicomum, the oldest collection germinated. This culture, pre-
pared by the usual method, germinated in very low numbers.
Dried overnight and rewet, it germinated in very high percentage
in about six hours.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It was found that in order to preserve the flagella of swarm-cells
for observation, the killing agent used in preparation of material
for microscopic examination must act very quickly. Smears pre-
pared by air-drying, or even by drying as quickly as possible over
mild heat, as is done in the preparation of bacterial mounts, showed
recognizable swarm-cells, all of which, however, completely lacked
flagella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most satisfactory results for temporary mounts were ob-
tained by killing and staining on the slide with a drop of iodine-
potassium iodide solution. For this purpose Gram’s iodine is used
without dilution, density of staining being controlled by varying the
Proportions of culture solution and iodine solution which are
mixed on the slide. Whatever proportions are used, mixing must
be accomplished quickly and thoroughly if the flagella are to be
preserved for observation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Permanent slides were prepared for observation of flagella by
use of a modification of the Loeffler stain for bacterial flagella (6).
The mordant and stain were prepared as directed, but the times of
application of both mordant and stain were reduced from five min-
utes to one-half minute. Swarm-cells thus stained with carbol
fuchsin were destained to transparency with acid alcohol, counter-#Misc-exposition*]

properly prepared slide the cell body is greenish, the nucleus red,
and the flagella deep green to purplish.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smears were prepared by various means. Slides were thinly
coated with albumin fixative, on which a drop of culture solution
was placed and inverted over osmic acid fumes. This was then
allowed to dry in air. Other smears, killed over osmic acid, were
fixed by heating gently after drying. Still others were killed with
iodine, as was done in the preparation of temporary mounts, and
allowed to stand until the iodine had sublimed. These slides were
fixed over heat. The crystals of potassium iodide were dissolved
off in distilled water before staining. Equally satisfactory results
were obtained with all these methods. "The iodine method, being
the simplest, was used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Germination. Cultures were prepared, by the method described
above, of 90 collections of Myxomycetes. All orders, all families
except the Dianemaceae and Collodermataceae, 30 genera, and 59
species were represented. Germination was obtained in 80 of the
collections. At least one culture of each species except Echino-
stelium minutum produced swarm-cells. Following is a list of col-
lections in which swarm-cells were not observed :#Misc-exposition*]

[@21. Cribraria intricata 1940
40-45. Echinostelium minutum 1936-1947
61. Stemontlis axifera 1916

69. Craierium leucocephalum 1941
87. Didymium squamulosum 1947#Table*]

[@E. minutum is such a small form that no collection provided
sufficient material to be handled as much as is required for wetting
by the bile salts method. Cultures had to be prepared directly in
water, in hanging drop mounts. It may be that these spores never
were adequately wetted, or it may be that fewness of spores resulted
in a lack of the mass-action factor postulated by Wilson and Cad-
‘man-(59) in the case of Reticularia Lycoperdon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It has long been recognized that each collection, rather than#Misc-exposition*]
[@154 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@each species, is a problem in itself. The bile salts technique for
the wetting of spores solved many problems in the way of germina-
tion, favorable results being achieved in most cases. But advance
wetting before culturing could not be expected to overcome all the
“internal factors” referred to in the literature, and so failure was
met in the four collections listed above, others of the same species
germinating well.#Misc-exposition*]

[@That wetting of spores is an important factor in germination
in vitro is obvious; for many collections which would not germi-
nate at all when cultured directly in water germinated readily when
previously wetted, and forms which germinated in very low num-
bers when cultured directly in water produced a higher percentage
of swarm-cells when wetted before culturing.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Age of the collection seems to have no important bearing on
germination within the limits of these experiments. In general, a
higher percentage of germination was obtained with material less
than a year old than with older material of the same species. How-
ever, Gilbert's observation that spores of Lycogala epidendrum do
not germinate until the fructification is a month old was confirmed.
Collection no. 15 was cultured on the day after collection, and each
week thereafter, each culture being maintained for one week. No
swarm-cells were observed until the fifth culture, made four weeks
after collection, which germinated abundantly in about six hours.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smith germinated spores of collections as much as 32 years old,
finding no correlation between age and percentage of germination.
In this study were included five collections more than 32 years old:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Again, no correlation was found between age and percentage of
germination. The oldest collection was cultured simultaneously
with 20 other collections of 19 different species, the ages ranging
from a few months to about 10 years. Swarm-cells were observed
in Physarum flavicomum before half of the others germinated. As#Misc-exposition*]
[@ELLIOTT: SWARM-CELLS OF MYXOMYCETES 155#Misc-exposition*]

[@is mentioned above, germination in this very old collection was
markedly improved by drying and rewetting the culture. None of
the other 20 collections responded to this treatment, and so within
six hours after rewetting the percentage of germination in P. flavi-
comum was much higher than was ever found in any of the rest.
The Stemonitis axifera was cultured with three others of the same
species, ranging from about one year to 13 years. The freshest
culture germinated 24 hours ahead of the rest, but percentage of
germination was about equal in all four, and apparent vigor of the
swarm-cells was equal in all cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Seventeen species not listed as previously germinated were
germinated in these tests. Two monotypic genera are represented :
Clastoderma Debaryanum and Cienkowskia reticulata. Kambly
(34) reports that attempts to produce plasmodia of C. Debaryanum
from spores were unsuccessful, but it is not clear whether he ob-
served germination of spores and production of swarm-cells of this
species. He further states that the plasmodium of C. Debaryanum
would not grow in artificial media away from its natural sub-
stratum. No special care was given the spores in these tests, but
swarm-cells were produced in abundance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Emergence of protoplasts from spore cases was observed in
every culture of every form in which germination occurred. In no
case was a flagellum observed on a protoplast at the time of emer-
gence. In these cultures, flagella were formed only after a resting
period of varying duration, and in several species smears made at
frequent intervals after emergence was first observed, showed the
growth of the flagellum to take place at a rather slow rate, requir-
ing as much as two hours in some cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In no culture was the emergence of more than one protoplast
from a single spore observed. All of the swarm-cells of Trichia
affinis and of Physarum melleum, and most of those of Trichia
favoginea, which were observed, were smaller than would be ex-
pected if a single swarm-cell were produced by each spore. But
the protoplasts seen emerging were the full content of the spore,
and so it is assumed that the size of the swarm-cells is the result of
divisions outside the spore case.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No germination was obtained at any time if the room tempera-#Misc-exposition*]
[@156 Mycorouta, Voi. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@ture was above 32° or 33° C. For this reason, experimental work
had to be discontinued during the hotter days of the stimmer.
Also, it was observed that whenever germination did take place
near the upper limit of tolerance, more myxamoebae and fewer
swarm-cells were found in the cultures than when cultures of the
same collections germinated at temperatures nearer 25° C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As is stated above, it is believed that the surface tension of the
culture solution is of considerable importance in the germination of
myxomycete spores. Unfavorable response to the low surface ten-
sion is the only obvious explanation of the reaction to aerosol solu-
tions observed. The fact that no germination, even of Enteridium
Roscanum, was obtained in the bile salts solution without washing
may be interpreted as implying that the bile salts are toxic, whether
the surface tension of the solution is unfavorable or not. All ob-
servers report best germination in neutral or slightly acid media.
The apparent toxicity of trisodium phosphate and the commercial
detergents is probably due to their alkalinity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Every culture prepared was observed to be contaminated with
bacteria from the time of preparation, and with various protozoa
if maintained more than 24 hours. Ciliates of the genus Colpoda
and a flagellate identified as Cercobodo agilis were the most com-
mon. The flagellate is of approximately the same size as a myxo-
mycete swarm-cell, but moves with a gliding motion so different
from a swarm-cell that the two forms are not easily confused even
under the lowest powers of the microscope. Cercobodo ayilis has
one anterior flagellum and a second flagellum equal to the first
arising near the middle of the body. The nucleus is approxi-
mately central, and the second flagellum arises near the nucleus.
This flagellum always trails and appears to he posterior, but that it
is not attached posteriorly is easily seen on living mounts as well
as on permanent, stained slides if high magnification is used. The
hipolar flagellate frequently reported in the literature was not seen
in any culture. The flagellate here described occurred in nearly
every culture, was most numerous in cultures of Cerationyxa, and
flourished and encysted prior to observation of swarm-cells in all
cultures of all collections more than 20 years old.#Misc-exposition*]

[@‘Flagellation, Some biflagellate swarm-cells were observed in#Misc-exposition*]
[@ELLIOTT: SWARM-CELLS OF MYXOMYCETES 157#Misc-exposition*]

[@every species studied. In several species the proportion of swarm-
cells obviously biflagellate was nearly 100%. Lycogala epiden-
drum, Cribraria purpurea (FIG. 3), Oligonema Schweinitaii (FIG.
7), Leocarpus fragilis (FIG. 18), Fuligo septica (xia. 17), and
Physarella oblonga (ries. 19, 20) were the most notable among
these. In most species the second flagellum is usually difficult to
see, but with careful, experienced observation it can be found on
nearly every swarm-cell studied. Zygotes with four flagella, rep-
resenting two biflagellate swarm-cells fused posteriorly, were found
occasionally in Dictydiaethalium plumbeum, Cribraria purpurea,
Oligonema Schweinitsii (rie. 8), Stemonitis fusca, and Tubifera
Jerruginosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On a great majority of swarm-cells of most species, the second
flagellum is very short, scarcely more than 1 4 long. (Swarm-cells
in this group will be referred to as “type I.”) See figures 1, 4, 5,
and 10. Other swarm-cells have the second flagellum somewhat
longer, measuring approximately half the length of the longer
flagellum (type IT), as shown in figures 12, 14, 15, and 18. And
on a few individuals the two flagella are nearly equal (type III),
as shown in figures 3, 20, 23, and 25. Previous accounts, though
maintaining the assumption that swarm-cells of Myxomycetes
are characteristically uniflagellate, have brought out this variation
in the length of the second flagellum. E. C. Smith (54, 55)
published photomicrographs showing biflagellate swarm-cells of
Reticularia Lycoperdon, Dictydiacthalium plumbeum, Lepidoderma
tigrinum, and Physarum cinereum with the second flagellum dis-
tinct, and Badhamia orbiculata in which only a dark line on the
hody of the cell is seen. All of the swarm-cells in his pictures are
type I. Gilbert (16) showed Stemonitis fusca with two flagella
nearly equal, though the rest of the forms he drew were definitely
heterocont. Ellison (15) drew swarm-cells of Stemonitis fusca '
and S. arifera with two flagella nearly equal even though the othejs,
he records have one flagellum much shorter than the other. e
vies. 14, 15, and 16.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a previous report on this same investigation (14) it was.
stated that all swarm-cells of Stemonitis splendens are of type III,#Misc-exposition*]
[@158 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@but all other species studied up to that time have swarm-cells ol
type I. It was further stated that the ratio of the lengths of the
two flagella is quite constant in any given species. Further study
has revealed exceptions to these generalizations. ‘Some smears of
Stemonitis splendens have contained numerous swarm-cells with
type II flagellation. None of type I, however, have been found in
this species. More variation in the length of the second flagellum
is found in those species in which it is usually of type IT or type ITI
than in those in which it is shorter. However, smears of Physa-
rella oblonga contain about 10% swarm-cells of type IIT, the rest
heing of type I. None of type II was found. (Cf. Figs. 19 and
20.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@All swarm-cells of species of the Reticulariaceae and of the
Trichiaceae which were studied were of type I, and all swarm-cells
of Twbifera ferruginosa, the only member of the Liceaceae in-
cluded in this investigation, were also of type I. In the Physa-
raceae most of the swarm-cells of the larger genera are of type I,
and most of the swarm-cells of the remaining genera are of the
longer types; but there is some variation in most species. Most
members of the Cribrariaceae, Stemonitaceae, and Didymiaceae
have swarm-cells predominantly of types [T and IIT, though here
again, there is considerable variation within most species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second flagellum, in addition to being very short, is usually
recurved so as to be almost indistinguishable from the outline of
the cell itself (FIG. 21). Even in those species in which both
flagella are relatively long, one is usually trailing, so that it is
easily overlooked (FIG. 6). The significance of this point is borne
out in the following observation : A temporary mount was prepared
from a culture of swarm-cells of Dietydiaethalium plumbeum. — "l'he
mount was killed and stained with Gram's iodine. Using the 90 x
oil immersion objective, the microscope was focused upon a swarm
cell in which hoth flagella were easily seen. Then, by touching the
edge of the cover slip with a dissecting needle, the mount was dis-
turbed while the original swarm-cell was kept in view. This
swarm-cell was observed to roll over and again come to rest. In
its new position, the shorter flagellum could not be seen with any
manipulation of the microscope. A second swarm-cell which pre-#Misc-exposition*]
[@ELLIOT: SWARM-CELLS OF MYXOMYCETES 159#Misc-exposition*]

[@sented only the longer flagellum to view was found, and by simi-
larly disturbing the cover slip the swarm-cell was maneuvered until
the shorter flagellum could also be seen. This same demonstra-
tion of the fact that the shorter flagellum may be—and frequently
is—hidden by the body of the cell, was also performed on mounts
of Fuligo septica and Arcyria denudata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second flagellum is clearly visible on only a very few swarm-
cells in most mounts. Some mounts stained with Loeffler’s tech-
nique were destained to transparency with acid alcohol. On
swarm-cells thus prepared the flagella remained clearly stained,
but the body of the cell was sufficiently destained so that the
nucleus and other cellular details were visible. When swarm-cells
are properly stained by this method, careful focusing on the an-
terior portion of the body of the cell will reveal a dark line reach-
ing backward from the apex to the base of the conical anterior
portion. Occasionally this dark line will be found lying across the
conical portion, either on or underneath the body of the cell, but
most frequently it is barely distinguishable from the outline of the
cell. It is not found on those swarm-cells on which the second
flagellum is clearly visible apart from the body of the cell. It is
believed that this is the shorter flagellum which ordinarily is closely
appressed to the anterior portion of the cell. Figures 5, 10, and
21 illustrate this condition to some extent, but the cases in which
the second flagellum is most difficult to see could not, of course, be
photographed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCLUSIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores of 80 collections representing 58 species of Myxomycetes
were germinated. Germination was induced or improved by previ-
ous wetting, using a solution of the bile salts as a wetting agent.
The flagellation of the swarm-cells of these species was observed
in temporary and permanent preparations. In some species it was
possible to see two flagella on nearly every swarm-cell observed.
In all other species, two flagella were clearly visible on some
swarm-cells, and it was demonstrated by manipulation of fluid
mounts that the second flagellum could be brought into view even
though not originally visible. From this it is inferred that if ade-#Misc-exposition*]
[@160 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@quate technique were used, the second flagellum would be found
on all myxomycete swarm-cells.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the biflagellate swarm-cells observed in this study were
definitely heterocont. In most species the two flagella differ
greatly in length. Even in those swarm-cells on which the two
flagella are nearly equal, there is usually a distinct, though slight,
difference in length.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Groupings of species based on the type of flagellation usually
found on swarm-cells of each species show little correlation with
the currently accepted classification of the Myxomycetes based on
morphology of the fructifications. This, and the fact that there is
considerable variation in the length of the second flagellum within
some species, seems to make the taxonomic significance of the
second flagellum, within the Myxonycetes, doubtful.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Myxomycetes and the Plasmodiophorales have long been
considered related groups hy many investigators. Formerly, the
reported existence of anteriorly uniflagellate zoospores in the re-
productive cycle of both groups was regarded as strong evidence of
this relationship. However, Ledingham (36, 37, 38) showed that
the zoospores of the Plasmodiophorales are anteriorly biflagellate,
the second flagellum being very short and hence easily obscured.
As a result of Ledingham's finding, the supposed difference in
flagellation was thought by many to emphasize a separation De-
tween the two groups.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The existence of two hlepharoplasts has heen reported in several
species of. Myxomycetes (16, 22, 56). Bessey (5) regards the
second hlepharoplast as a vestige of the hiflagellate condition, indi
cating that the Myxomycetes and the Plasmodiophorales have
arisen from a common ancestor. lle considers the loss of the
second flagellum as evidence that the Myxomycetes are of higher
phylogenetic positiun.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Insofar as flagellation is of phylogenetic significance, the exist-
ence of the second flagellum in the swarm-cells of Myxomycetes, as
demonstrated by this study, may indicate a closer relationship with
the Plasmodiophorales than has recently been supposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the course of a study of the aquatic Phycomycetes of Illinois
which has been in progress during the last several years, eighty-
five isolates representing the genus Pythium have been obtained.
It was found that these represented sixteen different species, in-
cluding one whose characteristics are such that it is being proposed
as new in the sub-genus Sphaerosporangium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Poitras: New Aquatic Species of Pythium 173#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphae freely branched and well developed on most culture
media, measuring 3.0-8.4 µm in diameter. Sporangia spherical, sub-
spherical, infrequently ellipsoidal or pyriform, occasionally papil-
late; terminal on lateral branches; measuring 29.5-55.0 µm, average
42.8 µm in diameter; proliferous, the secondary sporangia usually
formed within the walls of the primary ones; zoospores 30-50,
laterally biflagellate and reniform, formed within a vesicle borne
adjacent to the sporangium and measuring 8.4-10.5 4 X 10.5-16.8 µm
upon encystment. Oogonia spherical, ovoid or irregular, smooth;
terminal or intercalary, unisporous oogonia measuring 18.9~39.9 µm,
average 30.4 µm in diameter, multisporous oogonia measuring 26.4—
48.4 µm X 39.6-74.8 µm, size largely dependent upon the number of
oospores. Oospores spherical to ovoid, one to several per oogo-
nium, aplerotic, measuring 10.5-29.4 µm, averaging 21.6 µm in diam-
eter, with a smooth, moderately thickened wall. Antheridia an-
drogynous and diclinous, one to several, usually two, per oogonium ;

[@This fungus grows quite readily on most types of agar media
and on boiled hempseed in water. Growth on agar media is lim-
ited usually to surface and subsurface mycelia; however, scant
aerial hyphae developed on malt agar. The mycelial growth on
malt, malt-peptone and potato-dextrose agar media is quite pro-
fuse, whereas on corn-meal agar growth is very sparse. All stages
are produced readily on hempseed in water and, therefore, most of
the material used for this study was grown hy this method.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most distinguishing characteristic of this fungus is that many
of its oogonia contain more than one oospore. While about
seventy-seven per cent typically contain a single oospore, about
seventeen per cent contain two oospores, five per cent contain three
oospores and the remaining one per cent contain from four to six
oospores. Sorokin (1872) described Pythiwm polysporum. as a
species in which the oogonia contained several oospores, the oogo-
nia measuring 40.0—50.0 µm in diameter and the oospores measuring
7-8 µm in diameter. Butler (1907) excludes P. polysporum from
the genus Pythium on the basis of its sexual and asexual stages,#Misc-exposition*]

[@and both Matthews (1931) and Middleton (1943) concur in this
opinion, Matthews suggesting that it might represent a new un-
diagnosed genus of the Pythiaceae. It is quite evident that our
isolate is not the same as the one described by Sorokin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Oogonia with two oospores are infrequently produced in a lim-
ited number of species of Pythium. The most closely related
of these to Pythium multisporum is Pythium pulchrum, bat. P.
pulchrum differs from our isolate by possessing the following
characteristics: catenulate sporangia, the presence of a discharge
tube of variable length between the sporangium proper and the
vesicle, the lack of internal sporangial proliferation, and hypogy-
nous antheridia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Internally proliferating sporangia have been reported for sev-
eral species of Pythium, including P. proliferum, P. marsipium,
P. polytylum, P. helicoides, P. oedochilum, P. palingenes, and P.
nagii, but none typically produce more than one oospore in an
oogonium. Pythium proliferum differs also from D. multisporum
in that its sporangia and oogonia are smaller in diameter and that
hypogynous antheridia are characteristic. Pythium marsipium has
large spherical or asymmetrically utriform sporangia which are
papillate while P. polytylum has several reserve globules within
the oospores and elongate, cylindrical or irregularly shaped an-
theridia. Pythium helicoides is distinguished from our isclate also
by the fact that‘the antheridial stalk is coiled around the vogonial
stalk. Papillate sporangia and antheridia which are wavy, con-
toured and attached over their entire length serve to separate
P. oedochilum and P. palingenes from P. multisporum. — Pythium
nagii is obviously distinguished from our isolate because of the
small size of its sexual and asexual structures, the proliferous na
ture of its sporangia being the only factor serving to unite it with
this group. The presence of only a moderately thickened wall and
a single reserve globule in the oospore, the fact that vogonia char-
acteristically often possess several oospores, and the fact that the
sporangia are regularly spherical to subspherical serve adequately
enough to separate P. multisporum from other described species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PRESERVATION OF SAPROLEGNIACEAE
BY THE MINERAL OIL METHOD#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helen Simpson Reischer 1#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mineral oil method, originally developed for the conserva-
tion of bacterial cultures, has been applied to filamentous fungi
first by Sherf (1943), later by Norris (1944) and Wernham
(1946), and most widely by Buell and Weston (1947). The lat-
ter remarked upon the peculiar applicability of this simple method,
which they used successfully in preserving a collection of 1800 cul-
tures including, as well as higher fungi, Actinomycetes and ter-
restrial Phycomycetes, to delicate non-sporulating forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the time when Dr. Weston was carrying on this work the
author was faced with the problem of maintaining in pure culture
a number of aquatic Phycomycetes of the family Saprolegniaceae.
These fungi were being kept on Difco corn-meal agar slants in a
4-10 degree Centigrade coldroom. Such slants have a very un-
certain life, drying more or less unpredictably in from three to fif-
teen or nineteen months. Many species of this family produce
resistant spores (oospores), for which a successful method of
germination has recently been reported (Ziegler, 1948). These
spores have been reported as requiring a resting period, the limits
of which are not precisely known, so that cultures derived from
oospores would not always be readily available. Oospores do
not appear sttited to lyophilization. Of twelve isolates of. Achlya
with abundant mature oospores which were lyophilized, using the
method of Raper and Alexander (1945), none were viable three
months later. Microscopic examination revealed disorganization
of the oospores. The encysted zoospores (cystospores) of seven
isolates of Achlya disintegrated under lyophilization. The oospore-
producing species then, as well as the various forms of heterothallic#Misc-exposition*]

if any mature oospores, tust be considered for purposes of main-
tenance as non-sporulating mycelia for which the mineral oil
method might be suitable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As they were obtained, seventy-one isolates, including eight
genera, were grown on Difco corn-meal agar slants which were
then flooded with mineral oil, following the method of Buell and
Weston (1947), and subsequently incubated at 4-10 degrees
Centigrade. Of these, four isolates (Achlya and Brevilegnia)
were lost in 1946 at 6-11 months. At the same time 11 slants of
other isolates (Achlya) were discarded—four because they failed#Misc-exposition*]

long delayed, and assumed or observed to be the result of the
germination of oospores: other slants of the same isolates have
now, however, retained viability under oil for longer periods. It
is suggested that a possible reason for these early failures lies in
the use of unsupplemented corn-meal agar, on which Achlya and
Brevilegnia in particular showed relatively slow growth. In May,
1948, subcultures were made of the 133 slants of the remaining
sixty-seven isolates on corn-meal agar (forty-four isolates were
maintained as single slants, twenty-three isolates as 2-6 slants
each) which had been under mineral oil for varying periods, with

[@Const. J. Alexopoulos and Ed. E. Butler#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@On May 3, 1947 several ascocarps of Plectania coccinea (Scop.)
Fuckel were collected in Sanford woodlot, East Lansing, Michigan.
Upon microscopic examination of ascospores scraped off the hy-
menial layer, it was found that a number of them were already
germinating by means of one to four germ tubes each of which cut
off a conidium-like cell at the tip. The germ tubes varied in
length from approximately half the length of the ascospore to three
times that length. A number of detached “conidia” were also
found in the same mount.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An attempt was made to induce this phenomenon by germinating
ascospores on agar and in water. On May 5, ascospores were
caught on the surface of potato dextrose agar in a Petri dish in-
verted over a puffing apothecium which had been kept in a moist
chamber for two days. Several ascospores germinated, but no
“conidia” were formed. Spores from a puffing apothecium caught
on a dry glass slide subsequently placed in a moist chamber failed
to germinate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An apothecium collected on May 13 was placed in a moist cham-
ber. On May 15 ascospores were caught on a glass slide and
mounted under a cover glass in distilled water. The slide, sup-
ported on two pieces of glass rodding, was placed in a Petri dish
into which some water was poured. In 24 hours numerous asco-
spores situated near the edge of the cover glass had germinated by
means of one to four germ tubes. The percentage of germinated
ascospores diminished in proportion to their distance from the edge
of the cover glass. No conidia-like bodies had been formed as yet,
but typical constrictions in the germ tubes some distance from the
tip suggested that they were in the process of formation. Indeed
on May 17, 45 hours after ascospore ejection from the asci, numer-
ous “conidia” were observed completely formed at the tips of the
germ tubes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections from three localities near East Lansing were made
and observations were repeated in the spring of 1948 when the
ascocarps of Plectania coccinea again made their appearance.
Scrapings off the surface of the hymenium always yielded asco-
spores with germ tubes and “conidia” (FIG. 1). If the apothecia
were permitted to remain in a moist chamber for a few days, the
number of germinated ascospores and especially of detached
“conidia” increased greatly. "Conidia" were invariably produced
by the time the germ tube had grown to half the length of the
ascospore. In some cases “conidia” were found budding directly
from the ascospore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One apothecium was left in a moist chamber for a period of two
weeks. Scrapings off the hymenial layer were mounted in water
at the end of that period. The hymenium was in a state of ad-
vanced disintegration, but a very large number of the conidia-like
cells were evident among various contaminating organisms. All
ascospores had completely disintegrated.#Misc-exposition*]

found to be 14.5 x 31.5 µm while the average size of the “conidia”
was 45 x 11 µm. The range in size of the “conidia” was 3.7-5 X

[@The exact nature of the conidia-like cells abundantly produced
by Plectania coccinea, as reported above, is not clear. Germina-
tion has not been observed in any of the preparations in which
these cells were found, but no extensive germination studies were
undertaken.#Misc-exposition*]

ascospores of Pesisa wesiculosa and Bulgaria inquinans were ob-
served in 1865 by the Tulasne brothers (3). Copious “conidiola”
were observed on short, thick germ tubes arising from the asco-
spores. Brefeld (2) records production of similar structures he
calls conidia, from germinating ascospores of Coryne sarcoides,
but not from Plectania coccinea of which fungus he says, “

[@During the course of a review of the literature on Spermoph-
thora, Eremothecium, Ashbya and Nematospora the writer be-
came aware of the fact that though the first species described for
the genus Eremothecium, E. Cymbalariae Borzi, had been validly
published (2), another name, E. Ashbyi, had been proposed first
in 1935 (3) for a second fungus but had not been published validly
according to strict interpretation of Article 38 of the International
Rules of Botanical Nomenclature (5) in that the description was
published after January 1, 1935 and, unfortunately, was not ac-
companied by a Latin diagnosis. Though many mycologists would
disregard such a point, it seems to the writer that the description
of the fungus in question should be published effectively and validly
without more delay.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Guilliermond (3, 4) considered that the fungus he was describ-
ing best fitted into the genus Eremothecium. There were many
similarities between his fungus and £. Cymbalariae, it is true: The
manner of growth was the same in each; asci (or sporangia ?)
arose in each in a similar manner from multinucleate cells; the
spores had the same shape. However, there were several ways in
which’ the new fungus differed from E. Cymbalariae: in Eremo-
thecium the asci were described as solitary at the apices of hyphae,
lageniform or nearly so, with 30 or more spores in each, and the
spores were arranged in two clusters at opposite ends of the ascus;
in the new fungus, on the other hand, the asci usually were ar-
ranged in a series of several in an intercalary position and only oc-
casionally solitary, they were ellipsoidal-truncate, there were 4-32,
mostly 6-18 and rarely fewer than 4 or more than 32, spores in#Misc-exposition*]

years of cultivation had ceased to reproduce sexually but had a
form of asexual reproduction which basically was the same as that
demonstrated by the two organisms here discussed. Moreover,
Ashby and Nowell (1) had stated earlier that in S. Gossypü ‘The
spores germinate by germ-tubes which (1) develop into the pri-
mary mycelium or (2) fuse in pairs. . . ." It seems quite pos-

[@An adequate supply of a given vitamin has been found to be
essential for fruiting by some vitamin-deficient fungi. Sordaria
fimicola (1,7) was found to require more biotin for the formation
of perithecia and ascospores than for vegetative growth. The
amount of biotin required for the formation of ascospores was
greater than that required for the formation of perithecia. The
absolute amount of biotin required for the formation of perithecia
decreased as the amount of nutrients in the medium decreased.
Similar results have been reported for Ceratostomella fimbriata
(2) which is deficient for thiamin. The amount of thiamin re-
quired by this fungus for the production of perithecia decreased as
the amount of nutrients in the medium decreased. The numbers
of perithecia produced by these two fungi depended upon the
amount of nutrients present as well as upon the concentrations of
the vitamins employed. Hawker (3) found that the concentra-
tion of glucose optimal for the fruiting of sixteen fungi increased
as the concentration of growth substances increased.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It was considered desirable to extend the study of the interrela-
tions among nutrient supply, vitamin concentrations and sexual re-
production to another fungus. Chaetomium convolutum Chivers

[@Effect of biotin and thiamin upon growth and formation of peri-
thecia: Two extensive experiments were made to determine the ef-
fect of varying concentrations of thiamin and biotin upon growth,
the pH of the culture medium, and the formation of perithecia.
Since exogenous thiamin and biotin are required by this fungus, it
was necessary to keep the concentration of one vitamin constant
while the concentration of the other varied. A portion of the data
will be presented in the form of graphs.#Misc-exposition*]

was proportional to the amount of biotin in the medium when the
concentration of biotin was less than 0.04 µg. The time of incuba-
tion required to produce the maximum weight of mycelium with
the lower concentrations of biotin increased as the concentration of
biotin decreased. Autolysis followed soon after maximum weight
was attained. The pH of the culture medium remained near 5
during early growth; as the weight of mycelium approached a
maximum, the pH increased to 8-9. Presumably this increase in
pH is connected with the process of autolysis.#Misc-exposition*]

quired for perithecia to form, and to some extent the numbers pro-
duced. While a concentration of biotin greater than 0.04 µg. had
but little effect upon growth, these higher concentrations were more
effective in the rapid production of perithecia. Thus perithecia
were produced by the twelfth day when the concentration of biotin

half or more of the flasks in a given experiment exhibited peri-
thecia visible to the unaided eye. This variation in time of peri-
thecial formation was seldom greater than one day when the con-
centrations of biotin were greater than 0.04 µg. As the concentra-
tion of biotin was decreased further, this variation increased to as
much as a week (lowest concentrations). The pH of the culture
medium was always greater than 7 when perithecia formed. How-
ever, the flasks receiving 0.00625 µg. of biotin did not produce peri-
thecia after 49 days of incubation and the pH was 7.57 at this time.#Misc-exposition*]

[@concentration of the vitamins may be above or below the critical
concentrations, depending upon the concentration of nutrients in
the medium. In general, the time of incubation required to pro-
duce perithecia in the presence of fixed amounts of the vitamins
decreases as the medium becomes more dilute. Thus, the days re-
quired for perithecia to form when the biotin concentration was
0.025 ug. decreased from 46 to 20 and 12 days, respectively, when
the medium was diluted to one-fourth and one-sixteenth full
strength. However, perithecia did not form under any condition
tried in less than ten days. The formation of perithecia appears
to be connected with exhaustion of available nutrients.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A microscopic examination of the perithecia formed under the
conditions of the previous experiment was made on the sixtieth
day of incubation. At that time, the numbers of perithecia were#Misc-exposition*]

[@estimated by rough counts, and the maturity of the perithecia de-
termined by examination. A perithecium was judged mature if it
contained ascospores (the asci had degenerated in most instances
by the time the examination was made). The relative number of
mature and immature perithecia were estimated by rough counts
under the microscope. The relevant data are given in tables 1
and 2.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the presence of a given amount of nutrients (thiamin and
biotin present) vegetative growth takes place first. The amount
of vegetative growth is controlled by the amount of nutrients pres-
ent and by the concentrations of thiamin and biotin. Only as
vegetative growth attains a maximum do perithecia form. When
the concentration of nutrients is the factor limiting growth, peri-
thecia form only after the attainment of maximum growth. For
any concentration of nutrients certain concentrations of thiamin
and biotin are required before mature perithecia develop. Tower
concentrations of these two vitamins allow perithecia to form, but
these may never mature and form ascospores. At still lower con-
centrations of these vitamins perithecia do not form at all.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the amount of nutrients in the medium is reduced lower con-
centrations of thiamin and biotin are required for sexual repro-
duction. Under these conditions the amount of vegetative growth
is reduced and it may be deduced that each unit weight of mycelium
must contain certain concentrations of these vitamins before sexual
reproduction is possible. "Therefore, the relative amounts of nu-
trients and thiamin and biotin determine whether perithecia and
ascospores form and also control the time of incubation required
for their production.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The general conclusions reached in our studies on the factors
controlling sexual reproduction of Sordaria finicola and Ceratosto-
mella fimbriata were confirmed in this study of Chaetomium con-
volutum. More work will be required to determine the general
validity of these conclusions with regard to the sexual reproduc-
tion of other vitamin-deficient fungi. It is to be expected that
other nutritional factors may prove to be of equal importance as
other fungi are studied.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lilly AND BARNETT: CHAETOMIUM CONVOLUTUM 195#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hawker (4) has found nutritional factors in addition to the vita-
mins to be of great importance for the fruiting of Melanospora
destruens. Not only the concentration of the sugar, but the kind
used in the medium, was of great importance for the production of
perithecia by this species. Thus, 50 grams of sucrose per liter
allowed the formation of numerous perithecia; none were formed
under comparable conditions when the same weight of glucose was
used. A few perithecia formed when the amount of glucose was
reduced to 5 grams per liter, On the other hand, glucose sup-
ported greater vegetative growth of M. destruens than sucrose.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Klebs (5) fully recognized the role of specific constituents as
well as concentration of the medium in reproduction by the fungi.
His generalization that reproduction takes place under more re-
stricted environmental conditions than growth is confirmed in this
paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chaetomium convolutum is deficient for both thiamin and biotin.
In the presence of an optimum amount of one of these vitamins
growth was proportional to the amount of the other vitamin in the
medium. The formation of perithecia and ascospores followed
the attainment of maximum vegetative growth provided that the
concentrations of these vitamins exceeded certain values. The
absolute amounts of thiamin and biotin required for the formation
of perithecia and ascospores were a function of the concentration
of the nutrients in the medium. The numbers of perithecia formed
for a given concentration of nutrients increased somewhat as the
concentrations of the vitamins were increased, the numbers of ma-
ture perithecia formed were more nearly proportional to the con-
centrations of the vitamins. This was also true of the numbers of
ascospores formed. The amounts of thiamin and biotin required
for vegetative growth, perithecial formation and the production of
ascospores in the presence of a given amount of nutrients increased
in the above order.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Berkeley (2) in 1846 was the first to mention the occurrence of
a downy mildew on a species of Urtica. He compared Botrytis
Urticae Libert (evidently a manuscript name) and B. infestans
Mont. [= Phytopthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary], and concluded
that the two were distinct. He failed, however, to characterize
the former species adequately. Five years later, Berkeley and#Misc-exposition*]
[@-Broome (4) gave a more nearly complete description of B. Urticae.
They described the conidia as “large, ovate, apex papillaeform,”
and gave the host as “common nettle” (undoubtedly referring to
U. dioica L.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caspary (6) in 1855 transferred this species to the genus
Peronospora, but failed to give a description or a reference to an-
other description. Berkeley (3) in 1860 accepted this transfer
and used the binomial P. Urticae Casp. for the fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Next, de Bary (1), in his monograph of the family “Perono-
sporei,” described a downy mildew found on Urtica urens L.
which had apically rounded, basally pedicellate conidia. Oospores
typical of his section Effusae were also observed. Although he
applied the name “Peronospora Urticae (Lib.)” to his material,
de Bary stated that Berkeley and Broome’s description did not
agree with his.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subsequent workers, including Fischer (8), Berlese (5), Gäu-
mann (9), and many others, consistently listed both species of
Urtica as hosts of P. Urticae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Salmon and Ware (12) noted zoospore germination of conidia
produced on U. dioica and therefore made the combination Pseudo-
peronospora Urticae (Lib.) Salm. and Ware. After additional
study, these workers (13) pointed out that two distinct downy
mildews occur on species of Urtica. One, to which they applied
the binomial Pseudoper. Urticae (Lib.) Salm. and Ware, «has
apically papillate and poroid, colored conidia which germinate by
the formation of zoospores. It usually occurs on U. dioica, but has
also been found on U. urens, The other, to which they apply the
binomial Per. deBaryi Salm. and Ware, has apically rounded,
basally pedicellate, colored conidia which germinate by means of
a germ tube. This one occurs on U. urens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the United States, the first report of a downy mildew on
Urtica was made in 1880 by Harkness and Moore (10), who ap-
plied the binomial Per. Urticae to it. Next, Trelease (15) re-
ported the occurrence of “Peronospora urticae (Lib.)” on Urtica
gracilis Ait. from two localities in Wisconsin. These two pub-
lished records appear to be the only reports of a downy mildew on
Urtica in the United States. The listings in Seymour’s (14) and
Wilson’s (16) host indices are apparently based on these reports.
In the light of the findings of Salmon and Ware, it seemed ad-
visable to recheck all available material to determine the identity
of the fungus present in the United. States.#Misc-exposition*]

[@By personal correspondence, Lee Bonar has informed the writer
that, except for a few type specimens, the collections made by
Harkness and Moore were destroyed in the San Francisco earth-
quake and fire. It would appear that no portion of their collec-
tion is still extant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An attempt to locate additional specimens proved unsuccessful.

tion: "Peronospora Urticae (Lib.) D By. on remains of Aecidium
Urticae on Urtica gracilis. Glenwood, Minnesota; B. C. Taylor;
July, 1891.” A third portion of this collection reposes in the
University of Wisconsin Cryptogamic Herbarium. Careful ex-
amination of all three specimens failed to disclose the presence of
the downy mildew. Notes on the two packets from the New York
Botanical Garden indicate that G. W. Wilson was also unable tu
find a downy mildew present.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lee Bonar loaned the following specimen: "Peronospora Urticae
D By. on Urtica Lyallii; Marysville, Wash.; July, 1927; J. M.
Grant; U. Calif., Berkeley, Herb. No. 438288." Again a careful
examination failed to reveal the presence of a downy mildew.#Misc-exposition*]

[@G. R. Hoerner, who has reported successful experimental infec-
tion of Urtica spp. with Pseudoperonospora Humuli (Miyabe &

the writer, in personal correspondence, that he has never found a
downy mildew on any species of Urtica, and has no specimens of
naturally infected species.#Misc-exposition*]

Ware’s description of P. deBaryi. The conidia of the American

Because we have only one specimen, which lacks oospores, and be-
cause of the variability known to occur in the conidia of many

[@(with 3 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@A characteristic species of Helminthosporium was collected on
buffalo grass [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.] at Stockton,
Kansas, on July 24, 1895, by Elam Bartholomew, his No. 1799.
He labelled the specimen (in Herb.) “Helminthosporium incon-
spicuum C. & E. var. Buchloes E. & B. n. var" Bartholomew
supplied specimens of this same collection to J. B. Ellis who
issued them in 1896 as extra numbers with Ellis and Everhart,
North American Fungi, Century 34, as No. 45 (b), and with their
Fungi Columbiani, Century 9, as No. 298 (b). The former is
labelled “Helminthosporium inconspicuwm C. E. var. Buchloes,”
and the latter “Helminthosporium inconspicuum C. & E. var.
Buchloes.’ Subsequently, this fungus has been referred to as
*H. inconspicuum C. & E. var. Buchloes E. and Ev." (1, 2).
“H. inconspicuum buchloes Ell. and Ev.” (3), or simply as “H.
inconspicuwm var. Buchloes" (4).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to examining the exsiccati specimens referred to
above, six more recent collections of the same fungus on the same
host, referred to later, have been examined. In all of these, the
same characteristic fungus was found. Furthermore, the fungus
was found to differ distinctly from that originally described on
corn as Helminthosporiuin inconspicuum Cke. and Ell, now gen-
erally known as H. turcicum Pass. (5). The striking differences
in the way the conidiophores are produced in the two fungi and
in the shape, size, and hilum characters of their conidia are indi-
cated in table 1, and differences in spore characters are shown in
figures 2 and 3.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1 The writers are grateful to Edith K. Cash for assistance in preparing
the Latin description of the fungus on buffalo grass; to J. A. Stevenson for
counsel in connection with these studies; and to W. Lawrence White for
assistance in determining the date of issuance of the exsiccati specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of these differences, it seems clear that the fungus on
buffalo grass does not belong as a variety under H. inconspicuum
Cke. and ElL, but rather deserves specific rank. A search of the
literature indicates that the variety Helminthosporium inconspi-
cuum var. buchloes Ell. and Ev. has never been described. This
name, therefore, is a nomen nudum. Likewise the name “HH. in-
conspicuum var. buchloes E. & B.” (in Herb.) is a nomen nudum.

here described as:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Report of the 1947 Foray#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second in the new series of fungus forays of the Mycologi-
cal Society of America was held at Highlands, North Carolina,
September 2-7, 1947 under the leadership of Dr. Julian H. Mil-
ler, vice-president. Through the courtesy of Professor Thelma
Howell, resident director, and the other officers, the Highlands
Biological Laboratory was made available to those attending the
foray as a base for collecting operations. Working space, driers,
and other facilities were freely placed at the disposal of the
niycologists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the afternoon of Sept. 2, Dr. L. 5. Olive led the group
along the trail to Sunset Rock on the Ravenel Estate with collect-
ing along the way. September 3 was devoted to an all day trip
to Rabun Bald, an interesting botanical area in Rabun County,
Georgia. The mycological possibilities of a bog in which ecologi-
cal studies were in progress were investigated enroute. An ex-
pedition to the Upper White Water Falls in Transylvania County
accupied the morning of the 4th, and the two succeeding mornings
were given over to collecting along Rhododendron and Kelsey
Trails in the immediate vicinity of the Biological Laboratory. The
afternoons were available for the study and care of the collections.
As in the previous foray in West Virginia dry weather had pre-
vented abundant production of fleshy forms, but sufficient fungi in
other groups were found to make the occasion a success.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. W. A. Campbell exhibited a most interesting series of koda-
chrome pictures of the larger fungi at the Laboratory on Wednes-
day evening, Sept. 3, and an equally instructive series of koda-
chromes of the local flora was presented on Friday evening. On
Thursday afternoon the visiting ladies were taken by Professor
Howell and her associates on a tour to High Hampton Inn and a
number of estates in and about Highlands to view the floral effects.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Proposals for Amendment of the International Rules#Misc-exposition*]

[@I#Misc-exposition*]

[@Art. 47. An alteration of the diagnostic characters or of the
circumscription of a group without exclusion of the type does
not warrant the citation of an author other than the one who first
published its name.#Misc-exposition*]
[@216 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Proposal: delete the words “without exclusion of the type.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Argument: The sentence quoted is the first and essential sen-
tence in Art. 47 as amended at Amsterdam (Bisby, G. A., An
introduction to the taxonomy and nomenclature of fungi, p. 81.
1945; Brittonia 6: 16. 1947). The phrase in bold-face is the
modification (Zesde Int. Bot. Congr. Amsterdam Proc. 1: 344.
1936). It, and with it the whole sentence, is ambiguous in the
extreme. If the sentence means anything, it implies the affirma-
tive statement: An alteration of the diagnostic characters or
of the circumscription of a group with exclusion of the type
warrants the citation of an author other than the one who first
published the name. Since ‘ta nomenclatorial type is that con-
stituent element of a group to which the name is permanently at-
tached” (Art. 18), such exclusion would seem to be excluded by
the definition of "type." Under such an interpretation, which is
the logical one, the added phrase is inoperative and achieves no
end save that of confusion, and clearly should be revoked. But it
is likely that the implications of the type concept will be overlooked
and the amended article illogically accepted, although often under
protest, as implying the positive paraphrase just given.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The author of a name is cited “for the indication of the name
of the group to be accurate and complete” (Art. 46). After the
incorporation of the type concept into the rules, and before the
addition of the phrase under discussion, the author was the one
“who first published the name in question” (Art. 46). Knowing
the name and its author, a taxonomist was at least well on the
way to learning the date of the name (for consideration of pri-
ority), and the type, or at least, the constituent elements eligible as
lectotype (for determining the application of the name). This is
not to say that either could always be “readily verified”; but at
least the field of investigation was greatly narrowed. Homonyms
could give rise to difficulties; but a straightforward and honest
homonym could be dealt with by the "Auct. II non Auct. I"
formula widely used long before it was adopted as Rec. XXXII
bis (Bisby, l.c., p. 83; Brittonia 6: 18; Amsterdam Proc. 1: 344) ;
homonyms were identical names independently published for dif-
ferent types.#Misc-exposition*]

[@But under the amended Art. 47, according to the interpretation#Misc-exposition*]
[@Notes AND BRIEF ARTICLES 217#Misc-exposition*]

[@under discussion, there are as many homonyms of any name as
there are uses of that name with “alteration of the diagnostic char-
acters or of the circumscription of a group [with] exclusion of the
type.” The first two points are easy to identify. Since a later
author rarely repeats exactly in his description the original char-
acters ascribed to a group, a majority of subsequent descriptions
embody “alteration of the diagnostic characters.” One need scan
the successive descriptions of an early genus in only a few examples
to make sure of that: Agaricus L. ex Fr. was first validly pub-
lished with “lamellae . . . ascigerae," but later described as pos-
sessing basidia, and most recently as annulate and with purple-
brown spores. Puccinia was first validly described as having
spores "septulis distinctis"; additional characters have repeatedly
been added, as that the spores are one-septate (excluding multi-
septate species) and that the telia are dry (excluding those with
gelatinous horns). Since a later author usually adds to or sub-
tracts from the number of original species, either incidentally or
systematically, the majority of subsequent treatments embody
“alteration of the . . . circumscription of a group.” Agaricus
has been both repeatedly enlarged, by the addition of new species.
and repeatedly narrowed, by exclusion of one component after an-
other as autonomous genera, and finally has been restricted to Ser.
Pratella Trib. Psalliota. Puccinia has similarly been enlarged,
and similarly narrowed by the exclusion of Phragmidium, Gymno-
sporangium, Tranzschelia, etc. It is clear that such alterations of
the diagnostic characters and circumscription do not warrant the
citation of an author other than the one who first published the
name—unless (according to the interpretation under discussion)
accompanied by exclusion of the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Assuming without prejudice that the type can be excluded, how
can it be done? It is here that the sentence under discussion is
completely ambiguous. There are many possible ways of exclud-
ing the type: 1. By description. Clements & Shear described
Tulasnella (in a key: Gen. Fung. 158) as having “basidia . . .
cruciately divided by 3 vertical septa,” thus excluding T. lilacina,
the genotype. 2. By a statement of geographic range which ex-
cludes the type species or specimen. 3. By designation of another
type. Clements & Shear designated T. anceps, an alien species, as#Misc-exposition*]
[@218 Mycotocia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@the type of T'ulasnella (lc., p. 342). 4. By exclusion of the type
species (etc.) from the subgenus (etc.) named Typicae, Eu-, or
otherwise marked as the typical subdivision. Saccardo (Syll. 4:
283-288) excluded both original species of Zygodesmus from I.
Eu-Zygodesinus, assigning them to II. Hypochniella B. Leiosporae
of Zygodesmus. 5. By relegating the type to a list of Ignotae,
Dubiae, etc., having adequately described other components of the
group. 6. By various other phrases, comments, or discussions
indicating that the characters and circumscription in a particular
treatment were derived chiefly from other elements of the group
than the type. 7. By omission of the type. When an author dis-
cusses a genus as it occurs in Italy, he omits its type if that occurs
only in Germany. When an author enumerates material of a spe-
cies collected in South America, he may omit its type if that was
collected in the Caribbean. 8. By assignment or transfer of the
type to another group. Desmaziéres wrote (Ann. Sci. Nat. iii
11: 279): “Le Phoma pustulata, Fr., [an erroneous spelling, but
undoubtedly the designated type of Phoma| est un Sphaeria.”
Sparrow (Aquatic Phycomycetes) assigned all 16 original species
of Phlyctidium to other genera. Saccardo (Syll. 2: 285) trans-
ferred both original species of Venturia to Pyrenophora. Each of
these authors nevertheless used the generic name in question for
other species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is unlikely that any author would pounce upon all these pos-
sibilities as constituting veritable exclusion of the type, and likely
that most taxonomists, if they allowed the possibility that the type
could be excluded, would accept only the last: explicit exclusion,
or explicit assignment of the type to another group. Nevertheless,
since none of them is eliminated by Art. 47, nor by any other rule
(unless all are eliminated by Art. 18), Art. 47 is at present in-
superably ambiguous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Supposing the interpretation under consideration to be the ac-
cepted one, what are the effects of the interpolation "without ex-
clusion of the type"? They are two: 1. The bringing into exist-
ence of a number of validly published homonymous groups where
only one stood before. The number depends, of course, on what
is held to constitute exclusion of the type. Such groups will
clutter up the synonymy, and greatly increase the labors of tax-#Misc-exposition*]
[@NOTES AND BRIEF ARTICLES 219#Misc-exposition*]

[@onomists, but can and will be disregarded by most. 2. The crea-
tion of the possibility of recognizing a name in any sense in which
it has been misapplied (if exclusion of the type can be plausibly
argued) and, if the name is that of a genus, of conserving it. That
seems to be the one use of the amendment and all the trouble it
entails, and the one occasion for its adoption: a device to permit
the retention, by a change in author, of generic names which have
been incorrectly used. It is one more evasion of the type concept,
which has proved so useful to many botanists and so distasteful to
afew. As such it is burdensome, confusing, and inaccurate. The
modification is “on trial until the next Congress” (Art. 74), which
should reject it. Art. 18 contains the sound and practical pro-
vision for such cases: “The name of a group must be changed if the
type of that name is excluded.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@II#Misc-exposition*]

[@Proposal: To adopt, as a part of Appendix I, the following#Misc-exposition*]

[@REGULATIONS FOR FIXING GENERIC TYPES#Misc-exposition*]
[@I. RULES#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. The type species shall be the species or one of the species in-
cluded in the genus when first validly published after the applicable
date set forth in Art. 20. Ifa genus included but one species when
originally published, that species is the type. The types of genera
adopted through citations of literature published before the start-
ing-point for the group in question (with or without change of
name) shall be selected from those of the original species which
received names in the first legitimate publication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. When, in the original publication of a genus, one of the spe-
cies was definitely designated as type, that species shall be ac-
cepted as the type, regardless of other considerations. If typicus
or typus was used as a new specific name for one of the species,
that species shall be accepted as the type as if it were definitely
designated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. The publication of a new generic name as an avowed substi-
tute for an earlier one does not change the type of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@220 Mvcorucıa, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. If a genus without an originally designated type contains
among its original species one with the generic name used as a
specific name, either as an accepted name or synonym, that spe-
cies is to be accepted as the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. If a genus when originally published included more than one
species, and no species was definitely designated as type, nor indi-
cated according to Paragraph 4, the choice of the type shall ac-
cord with the following principles:#Misc-exposition*]

[@(a) Species inquirendae or species douhtfully referred to the
genus or mentioned as in any way exceptional are to be excluded
from consideration in selecting the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(b) Species which definitely disagree with the generic descrip-
tion (provided others agree), or which possess characters stated
in the generic description as rare or unusual, are to be excluded
from consideration in selecting the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. Among species equally eligible, the preference shall be given
to the first known to have heen designated as the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@II. RECOMMENDATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the selection of types of genera previously published, but of
which the type would not be indicated by the preceding regulations,
the following points are to be taken into consideration:#Misc-exposition*]

[@i. The type species should usually be the species or one of the
species which the author had chiefly in mind. This is often indi-
cated by#Misc-exposition*]

[@(a) A closer agreement with the generic description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(b) Certain species being figured (in the same work).#Misc-exposition*]

[@(c) The specific name, such as eulgaris, communis, medicinalis
or officinalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ii. The type species should usually be the one best known to the
author. It may be assumed that an indigenous species (from the
standpoint of the author), or an economic species, or one grown in
a botanical garden and examined by the author, would usually rep-
resent an author's idea of a genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@iii. The preceding conditions having been met, preference should
be shown for a species which will retain the generic name in its
most widely used sense, or for one which belongs to a division of#Misc-exposition*]
[@NOTES AND BRIEF ARTICLES 221#Misc-exposition*]

[@the genus containing a larger number of species, or for the his-
torically oldest species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@iv. If it is impossible to select a type under the conditions men-
tioned above the first of equally eligible species should be chosen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: The present Rules are somewhat prolix in their
provisions for determining the proper names for plants, but quite
vague and unsatisfactory in indicating for what plants these names
are to be used. The type method was written into the Rules
(Art. 18; Rec. IV-VII) in response to the demand for regulations
covering the applications of names; but perhaps out of fear that it
would invalidate current irregular or perverted usages, Appendix
I, “Regulations for determining types," has not been written. In
fact, the heading for this Appendix bears the note “No draft of this
Appendix has been submitted.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whether or not such a draft has been formally “submitted,” such
drafts, and excellent ones, have been prepared and published. The
one here proposed is essentially a rearrangement of one written by
a committee of the Botanical Society of America, composed of
A. S. Hitchcock (Chairman), N. L. Britton, and J. Mf. Greenman,
with the collaboration of Leroy Abrams and Witmer Stone, and
published in Science 49: 333-335. 1919. It has the advantages
of being clear, simple, and honest, and the further advantage of em-
bodying established custom (Art. 5)—that is, the consistent prac-
tice of most botanists (and of nearly all botanists when they are not
seeking justification for the employment of a beloved, but illegiti-
mate nomenclature). If nomenclature is to be governed by rules
rather than exception, Appendix I should no longer be left a blank;
and these provisions recommend themselves as filling a pressing
need.—Donald P. Rogers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@William Henry Long was born March 7, 1867, in Navarro Co.,
Texas, and died December 10, 1947 at Albuquerque, New Mexico,
where he had long resided. He took his undergraduate work at
Baylor University, Waco, Texas, receiving the A.B. degree in
1888. Following graduation he served as Professor of Natural
Sciences with his Alma Mater until 1892 when he assumed a sim-
ilar position at Burleson College, Greenville, Texas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Feeling the need for further botanical training he severed his
connection with this institution in 1899 to take graduate work in
his chosen field at the University of Texas, under the guidance
of Professors Wm. L. Bray and W. M. Wheeler, where he also
served as assistant in botany for the period 1900-1901. As a
result of his studies here the A.M. degree was given him in 1900.
His first mycological paper on the distribution of the fungi of Aus-
tin and vicinity was prepared and published at this time. For the
next nine years he was Professor of Botany at North Texas State
Normal College at Denton. Here with increased tempo he con-
tinued his mycological studies with emphasis on the Uredinales.
During this time he published his classical paper on the Ravenelias
of the United States and Mexico as well as several on other rusts
and on the Phalloideae of Texas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@tunately, most of his Texas specimens were lost in a fire in his
home at Denton about 1907. Many of his collections, however,
had been shared with other mycologists so that the loss was not
as serious as it would have been had it not been for this life-long
habit of collecting abundantly and exchanging freely.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During this time, in addition to extensive mycological field
work in the vicinity of Denton, several summers were spent at
Cornell University in similar activities under the direction of
Professor Geo. F. Atkinson. These studies were ultimately the
basis of his doctoral dissertation presented in 1917 to the Uni-
versity of Texas which granted the Ph.D. degree.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Long entered federal service in January, 1910 as a member of
the editorial staff of the Experiment Station Record in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture at Washington, being assigned to the field of
“agricultural botany, bacteriology and vegetable pathology.” This
sedentary existence was not particularly to his liking and after
some 18 months he transferred to the then comparatively new
Office of Forest Pathology in the Bureau of Plant Industry. Here
under the leadership of Haven Metcalf he became one of the group,
which included George G. Hedgcock, P. Spaulding, E. P. Mein-
ecke, J. R. Weir and others, who pioneered in the development
of forest disease work in the United States.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Following a short stay at Washington headquarters where he
studied wood rots, and forest-tree rusts, particularly those of the
genus Gymnosporangium, he was assigned to head up the work in
the Southwestern States with headquarters at Albuquerque, New
Mexico. Here he spent the remainder of his career, for a time
covering a territory which extended from Arizona to Florida, but
soon restricting his activities to Arizona, New Mexico, and Col-
orado. Some forty technical papers cover his work for the period,
ranging over the many problems encountered in the forests of his
region, all studied in close cooperation with the U. S. Forest
Service.#Misc-exposition*]

rots in general, his outstanding accomplishments were the develop-

with the assistance of David J. Stouffer and other experienced col-

[@Several maizemeal-agar plate cultures which after having been
overgrown with mycelium of Pythium manillatum Meurs had been
further planted on January 3, 1947, with small quantities of leaf
mold kindly collected by Dr. E. B. Toole in an oak wood near
Greensboro, North Carolina, in December, 1946, showed, on
microscopical examination twenty-seven days later, sparse stands
of erect beaked conidia arising in scattered areas from prostrate
hyphae often arranged more or less radially. The general aspect
of the conidial apparatus indicated clearly a species of Endocochlus.
While the robust stature of the erect spores was rather stronglv
suggestive of my E. gigas (6: 368-371), their longer and accord-
ingly much more conspicuous empty apical beaks made for an ap-
pearance alien to that species as well as to the smaller congeneric
forms I have described under the binomials E. asteraides (5: 8-15)
and E. brachysporus (6: 364-367). Closer examination, in which
attention was given also to the vegetative and the sexual reproduc-
tive stages associated with the conidial apparatus, brought to light
morphological peculiarities amply distinguishing the fungus here
concerned as a new member of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Like the congeneric forms previously described, the new species
subsists through parasitism on a relatively large terricolous
-moeba. Animals in the earlier stages of attack (FIG. 1, A; FIG. 2,

100 to 130 in width when drawn into a rounded shape. They#Misc-exposition*]

[@were enveloped individually by a firm pellicle that for the most
part was cast into broadly undulating folds. Their hyaline, ob-
scurely granular protoplasm surrounded a single prolate ellipsoidal
nucleus (FIG. 1, 4, n; FIG. 2, A, n; FIG. 3, A, n; FIG. 4, A, 2), com-
monly 27 to 32% long and 18 to 21 wide, that contained at its
periphery a large number of globose bodies about 1 µm in diameter.
At the two poles of the nucleus these bodies, presumably con-
sisting of chromatin material, were massed several layers deep,
while in the equatorial region they were present usually in a single
layer. Owing to the deeper accumulation of globose bodies at the
poles the homogeneous central portion of the nucleus was often ap-
proximately equal in length and width. Many infected animals, as
also many healthy individuals of the same species, contained one
or more specimens of the testaceous rhizopod Euglypha levis
(Ehrenb.) Perty (FIG. 1,4, w; FIG. 2,4, w), which, being abundant
in the cultures, had apparently been ingested to serve as food
material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of close resemblances in nuclear organization, the pro-
tozoan here in question is held referable to mocha papyracea
Penard (8: 201). While the measurements given by Penard for
width of rounded individuals—minimum 176 µm, maximum 198 µm—
are considerably in excess of those prevailing in my cultures, smaller
dimensions would seem to be more or less normal in Amoeba pop-
ulations developing on agar substrata. Previous to its appearance
as the animal host of the new Endocochlus the protozoan had not
been noted in the many agar plate cultures prepared from leaf mold
from different sources over a period of more than ten years.
Whether its failure to develop more often in plate cultures is due
to limited distribution or to special requirements for multiplica-
tion, its absence in any material naturally precludes development
of the zodpagaceous form habitually subsisting on it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Encounter between specimens of .dimoeba papyracea and the fun-
gus takes place much as in the several other species of Endocochlus
made known earlier. When the Amoeba in its ordinary locomotion
comes in contact with a conidium of the parasite the conidium re-
mains affixed to the animal’s pellicle, apparently through adhesion.
From the adhering region the spore soon puts forth a bulbous pro-
tuberance, about 3 or 4 µm wide, which serves presumably as an ap-#Misc-exposition*]

[@pressorium since its rather thick wall usually shows later the vel-
lowish coloration characteristic of adhesive structures in the
Zoópagaceae. The protuberance soon begins to elongate apically
as a germ tube, in many instances at first pushing the pellicle in-
ward to form a funnel-shaped depression. After the pellicle has
heen ruptured under increasing pressure the germ tube continues
its growth some little distance into the protoplasmic interior.
Elongation then ceases, and the narrowed tip of the germ tube
abruptly begins expanding into a bulbous swelling (FIG. 1, 4, a).
Through progressive vacuolization the contents of the adhering
conidium migrate gradually into the terminal swelling. When
this migration is completed the externally adhering conidial en-
velope is wholly empty, as is also the germ tube on whose tip is
then borne a prolate ellipsoidal or nuciform cell (FIG. 1, 4, D)
densely filled with protoplasm. Disturbances deriving from the
movements of the animal readily suffice to detach the nuciform cell
from its slender support. Following such disjunction the empty
germ tube together with the conidial envelope is shed by the ani-
mal; while simultaneously the nuciform cell, or infective body
(FIG. 1, 4, ¢), immersed in its mobile protoplasmic ambient, be-
gins autonomous parasitic development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the assimilation of nourishment from the host protoplasm,
the infective body here sometimes grows out nearly as in the other
known species of Endocochlus, by putting forth from its distal end
a single prolongation that usually begins curving at an early stage
(FIG. 1, A, d, e; FIG. 2, A, a; FIG, 3, A, a-c) to form a close helical
coil (FIG. 1, 4, f; FIG. 3, A, d, e), which, after describing one and
one-half to two turns, may branch'dichotomously (FIG. 3, A, f, g).
Even where only a single thallodic coil is formed the present fungus
Shows for some time, if not to the end, a distinctive peculiarity in
that the prolongation is, as a rule, at least in its proximal portion,
conspicuously narrower than the infective body, so that this body
stands out as a proximal swelling. In contrast, the infective bodies
of congeneric species, and also of those species of Cochlonema hav-
ing a similar manner of invasion, grow out distally at an increasing
width and thus become merged indistinguishably with the resulting
thallus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DRECHSLER: AN ENDOCOCHLUS 233#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the production of a single thallodic coil is hardly in-
frequent in the present fungus, the much more usual manner of
development here is by the extension of two thallodic coils. The
two coils arise as small buds from opposite sides at the distal end
of the infective body (FIG. 1. 4, g). Through continued elonga-
tion, together usually with some distal widening and with constantly
winding curvature (FIG. 1, 4, h), they develop, as a rule, on op-
posite sides of the infective body, into helical coils which commonly
remain unbranched until they have described one and one-half to
two turns (FiG. 1, A, i-1; FIG. 2, dl, b-h; FIG. 3, A, h, i; FIG. 4, A,
d, b). Somewhat contrary to expectations that might be enter-
tained, the coils are not oriented usually with their axes extending
away directly from the sides of the infective body to which, re-
spectively, they are attached, but instead are oriented with their
axes perpendicular to the plane passing lengthwise through the
middle of the infective cell and bisecting the basal attachments of
both coils. The considerable measure of uniformity in positional
relationships of the binary thallodic coils—a measure of uniformity
seeming all the more remarkable because it is achieved despite con-
stant disturbance from promiscuous movement of the protoplasmic
ambient—is to be attributed to unusually consistent directive tend-
encies in growth that become manifest early in the elongation of
the buds. After the initial abrupt curvature of the buds toward
the proximal end of the infective body (FIG. 1. A, g), further curva-
ture is such that if the infective body lies with its longitudinal axis
in the plane of the microscopical field and with its proximal end di-
rected toward the observer, the bud arising from the right side of the
distal end will elongate with its advancing tip interposed between
the observer and the infective body, while the bud from the left
side of the distal end will elongate with its advancing tip passing
underneath the infective body into partial concealment from the
observer (FIG. 1, 4, h). The three-dimensional curvature thus
initiated is continued with further growth of the two buds; so that
with the infective body oriented in the way just described, the bud
arising on the right side of the distal end is soon found prolonged
into a helical coil overlying the infective body and with its axis di-
rected toward the observer in a line nearly parallel with his line
of vision, while the bud arising from the left side of the distal end#Misc-exposition*]

[@will be found extended into a similar coil underneath the infective
body and with its axis directed vertically downward in a line like-
wise approximately parallel to the line of vision (FIG. 1, I, I;
FIG. 3, 4, h; FIG. 4+, 4, b). Curvature in similar relationship to
the infective body and in the same direction of rotation prevails also
where only one thallodic coil is produced, as well as in the occasional
instances where three coils are formed (FIG. 1l, 4, o). Thus, re-
gardless of variation in number, the coils consistently show rotation
of the same direction as is found in the threads of a left-handed
screw. To cite familiar examples from phanerogamic plants, the
rotation shown here corresponds to that displayed in the twining
stems of the common hop, Humulus lupulus L., and the black
bindweed, Polygonum convoleulus L. Among fungi similar left-
handed rotation occurs as a distinctive feature in the helicoid asco-
spores of my Cochliobolus heterostrophus (2, 4), in the conidia of
my Harposporium helicoides (7), in the coiled sporogenous tips
of the sporophores of my Helicocephalum oligosporum (3), as well
as in the aerial sporogenous branches and spore chains of some
helicoid species of Streptomyees (= Actinomyces) as, for example,
S. lavendulae (Waksm. & Curt.) Waksm. & Henr. (1: 150-151; 9;
10: 944).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since both of the two thallodic coils usually produced show ro-
tation in the same direction they could well be regarded, especially
during their earlier stages of growth, as making up a single binary
helicoid structure modified midway between the ends by the pres-
ence of the protuberant infective cell. In many instances, however,
the continuity of the combined structure is interrupted through evac-
uation of the infective body together usually with a proximal por-
tion of the thallodic coils (FIG. 1, A, k; FIG. 2, A, h; FIG. 4, A, a);
the larger, living portion of each coil then becoming delimited proxi-
mally by a retaining wall. The empty envelopes of infective bodies,
after some time, often vanish completely from sight ; so that, eventu-
ally, many of the larger thallodic coils (FIG. 3, A, j; FIG. 4, A, c)
come to appear little different, at the proximal end, from those of
other species of Endocochlus, where the infective body, because of
its broad elongation from the full width of its distal end, merges in-
distinguishably with the thallus,#Misc-exposition*]

[@The larger thallodic coils are branched in varying measure, as
many as three successive bifurcations often being recognizable
(FIG. 4, A, d). Whether a coil is of solitary (FIG. 2, A, 7; FIG. 3,
A, f, g) or of twinned (FIG.1,A,m. FIG. 3.A, j, b; B,a-d. FIG. 4,
4, c, d) origin, its first dichotomy usually takes place after one and
one-half to two turns have been formed, though thalli are not rare
wherein much earlier bifurcation is clearly evident (FIG. 2, 4, j, k).
Following the first dichotomy, elongation of the branches is marked
by diminished curvature, with the result that a thallodic coil whose
first two turns may have an outer diameter equal to the length of
the parent infective cell will after three successive dichotomies ex-
tend its eight branches rangily over an orbit three or four times
wider (FIG. +, 4, d). Owing apparently to their rather open ar-
rangement the longer terminal elements of well developed thalli
are somewhat readily displaced from their original positions when
they are jostled by other thalli in an animal under multiple attack.
Accordingly in later stages of infection the larger thalli lose much
of their geometrical symmetry as they are pressed together closer
and closer. Before the protozoan host is incapacitated for further
movement, primarily from advanced depletion of its protoplasm,
the several thalli become confusedly intertangled in a dense clew
(Fig. 5, A, B).#Misc-exposition*]

progressive degeneration of its nucleus (FIG. 5, 4, 1; B, n) eventu-
ally leads to the extinction of all signs of life. At this stage, or
frequently a little earlier, the several thalli begin reproductive de-
velopment. Where an infective cell is still present it often serves di-
rectly in putting forth one (FIG. 6, 4, a) or more (FIG. 6, B, a, b)
reproductive hyphae, while others are being extended from proxi-
mal positions on the associated coil (FIG. 6, A, b) or coils (FIG. 6,
B,c,d). Naturally in those instances where the infective cell has
been lost, all reproductive hyphae (FIG. 6, C, a-h) arise from the
thallus, and in some instances all reproductive hyphae (FIG. 6,
D, a-g) originate from the thallodic coils even where the infective
body remains intact. The growth of the reproductive hyphae
(1G. 6, E, a-d) is accompanied by vacuolization and evacuation of#Misc-exposition*]

in the distal parts of the coil (FIG. 6, 4, B) and later in more proxi-
mal parts. Retaining walls are laid down at intervals in the pro-
gressive withdrawal of protoplasm (FIG. 6, E), much as in the other
species of Endocochlus, as well as in most species of Cochlonema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The reproductive hyphae destined to serve in the development of
conidia push their way to the animal’s integument without establish-
ing any definite positional relationships to one another. On break-
ing through the pellicle they elongate radially from the dead ani-
mal until they extend procumbently over the surface of the culture
for distances frequently of 2.5 to 3 mm. They usually show only
rather gently curving deviations from their generally straightfor-
ward courses, and only small departures from their usual width of
about 34. After reaching their definitive length they soon put forth
erect protuberances (FIG. 4, B, a; FIG. 5, C, a-c) often at intervals
of 75 to 125 µm. Thereupon the hyphal contents near the middle
of each interval become noticeably vacuolate (FIG. 4, B, b). As
material is supplied for further growth of the protuberances the
vacuolate portions are emptied and retaining walls are formed.
Continued withdrawal of protoplasm soon leads to evacuation of
an adjacent hyphal portion and deposition of another wall closer
to the growing protuberance (FIc.4,C. rFIG.5,D,a-c;E). With
repetition of the process the living hyphal segment is further re-
duced (FIG. 4, D. FIG. 5, F, a; G, a), and finally, as a rule, the
remaining hyphal contents migrate into the erect outgrowth, which
then is delimited a little above the base by a thickish septum (FIG.
4,8. FIG. 5, F,b;G,b). During the later stages of its growth,
the erect body usually extends upward a narrow apical prolongation,
which is soon delimited at the base by a rather thick wall or some-
what irregular plug-like partition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the erect conidium thus formed resembles that of Endo-
cochlus gigas in the fusoid shape of the living cell, it is of generally
greater dimensions throughout (FIG. 1, B-Z. FIG. 4, F-V. FIG. 5,
H, a-z; I, a-2; J, a-z). It is distinguished more especially, how-
ever, by its narrow apical appendage, which as a rule is not only de-
cidedly longer in actual measurement than the corresponding part in
E. gigas, but is markedly longer also in comparison with the living
cell; though in occasional specimens the appendage may be small#Misc-exposition*]

a minute cap of solid wall material (FIG. 1,77, W. FIG. 4, V. FIG.
5, F, b; G, b; H, y; L, b), or in very imperfect specimens may be
wholly absent (FIG. 1, Z). When the mature conidium becomes
detached, it does not usually separate from the empty hypha flush
with the lower sidé of its basal wall but is abjointed commonly at
a distance of 0.5 to 2 µm or more rarely as much as 3 a, from this
wall; so that the spore carries at its base a curious membranous
prolongation, a little like an appendage. This somewhat untidy
manner of separation is not governed by chance, for the portion of
hyphal membrane that accompanies the spore is always noticeably
thicker than the hyphal envelope generally. and thus must have
undergone earlier some special modification. In some instances
where the basal septum was formed flush with the parent hypha,
the membranous prolongation may include a cylindrical portion of
the hyphal envelope (FIG. 1. N. W'.. FIG. 4. J. Fig. 5, Hy 7, s, y;
Ic, v, x; J, f, 2). Again, in occasional instances where because
of incomplete transfer of protoplasmic contents the living cell of the
detached spore includes a portion of the parent hypha (FIG. 1, Y, 2.
FIG. 5, H, t; [, a, b, d, e), a short cylindrical portion of empty hy-
phal envelope is present at each of the two basal ends.
Germination has been observed taking place only in the conidia
that have become affixed to the pellicle of a host animal. Never-
theless, in cultures where the fungus has been active on a large
scale for a few days, the conidia strewn about on the substratum
usually include many individuals with lateral outgrowths and
membranous attachments of various shapes (FIG. 2, B-M). These
modifications clearly derive from germinative development frus-
trated at different stages. In resisting infection from individual
conidia of the fungus, Amoeba papyracea seems much more often
successful than any other rhizopod I have hitherto seen undergoing
attack by any- zodpagaceous parasite. In several observed in-
stances the animal protruded a pseudopodium at the place of attack,
thereby eventually confining the germ hypha in a small narrow-
necked pouch. By persistent rotational movement of the animal
the slender attachment was twisted off, and the pouch, consisting of
a piece of pellicle and some protoplasm, was left behind adhering to
the conidium (FIG. 2,C). The host animal appeared to carry out#Misc-exposition*]

[@such defensive maneuvers repeatedly with different conidia, even
when it was already infected with many growing thalli and thus
was assuredly doomed. The conidia, on their part, were by no
means rendered harmless by being sloughed off. If they had pro-
duced a long germ tube in their unsuccessful venture, the proto-
plasma in the tube was withdrawn backward into the spore envel-
ope itself (FIG. 2, E-G), or into a short protruding stump (FIG. 2,
B, D, H). If only appressoria had been formed, they were like-
wise evacuated when of large size (FIG. 2, J), but when relatively
small (FIG. 2, K-M) were often left unchanged. Some conidia
bore four or five frustrated germinative structures—appressoria
and evacuated germ hyphae (FIG. 2, F)—thereby giving evidence
of a corresponding number of unsuccessful attempts at infection.
The development of zygospores is initiated by reproductive hy-
phae of about the same width as those concerned in the formation
of conidia. These hyphae make known their distinctive function by
coming together in pairs inside the animal—the two members of a
pair (FIG. 6, P, a, b) directing their growth in such wise as to
bring their tips in contact with each other and at the same time
with the inner surface of the animal's pellicle (FIG. 6, F, p). Pair-
ing apparently never takes place between hyphae arising from the
same vegetative thallus, single or binary; for in all instances where
the difficulties of observation occasioned by the intertangling of
fungus coils are not too troublesome, the two members of a pair are
always traceable to separate thalli. "Thus, in the reproductive ap-
paratus shown in figure 6, G, where the two thalli a and 5 have
each produced several reproductive hyphae, no pairing took place
either between the three hyphae c-e arising from thallus a, or
between the four hyphae f-i arising from thallus b, but the hypha e
from thallus a was found paired with the hypha g from thallus b.
Likewise in figure 6, H, showing portions of two thalli, a and 6, no
pairing could he made out between any of the five reproductive
hyphae c-g arising from thallus a, but one of them, f, had paired
with a hypha, 4, coming from thallus b. Again in the reproductive
apparatus shown in figure 6, J, the two empty thalli a and 5 are
seen to have contributed the paired hyphae c and d, respectively,
although the three additional hyphae e-g arising from thallus b
have not paired with one another. Further, in the unit of sexual#Misc-exposition*]
[@244 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@apparatus shown in figure 6, J, the empty thalli a and b have con-
tributed the paired zygophoric hyphae c and d, respectively ; while
similarly in the unit of sexual apparatus illustrated in figure 6, K,
the empty thallus a and the empty infective body b, separate from
it, have given off the paired zygophoric hyphae c and d, respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The paired zygophoric hyphae, on making apical contact with
each other and also with the host animal’s pellicle (FIG. 6, G-K: p),
secrete at their tips some yellow adhesive material. Thus anchored
securely to the pellicle, they break jointly through this envelope,
and then elongate externally side by side for distances varying com-
monly from 5 to 35 µm hefore fusing at the tip. Asa rule, and more
especially where elongation takes place under the surface of a cul-
ture, the hyphae follow rather straightforward courses (FIG. 6, G).
Where external elongation takes place on the surface of a culture
the zygophoric hyphae in some instances wind spirally about one
another, their direction of rotation then being indiscriminately
either right-handed (FIG. 6, H) or left-handed, rather than con-
sistently left-handed like the rotation in the thallodic coils.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When their elongation ceases the paired hyphae fuse apically and
begin to bud forth a globose body (FIG. 6, G, j; H, i) directly at the
place of union, or terminally on a short stout prolongation usually
not more than 2 µmin length. Meanwhile a cross-wall (FIG. 6, G,'s;
H, s; J, s; K, s) proximally delimiting a gametangium makes its
appearance in each of the paired hyphae and usually in a position
well within the host pellicle. The globose body increases gradually
in size as it receives protoplasmic material from the gametangia.
When the gametangia have given all their contents, it usually has
reached a definitive diameter of approximately 15 (FIG. 6, J, h;
J, e; K, e) and then apparently becomes delimited at or near the
base by a retaining wall. The protoplast of the subspherical zygo-
sporangium thus set off soon shrinks away from the enveloping
wall, which thereupon usually collapses slightly to present a some-
what wavy contour (FIG. 6, L). Later the protoplast takes on an
angular shape (FIG. 6, M), preparatory evidently to the formation of
a yellowish zygospore wall with a pronouncedly warty or stellate
outline. Within this wall the originally granular contents round
up into a spherical living cell (FIG. 3, C-P; FIG. 6, N). At ma-
turity this cell seems to he constituted, as a rule, of an outer granu-#Misc-exposition*]
[@DRECHSLER: AN ENDOCOCHLUS 245#Misc-exposition*]

[@lar layer surrounding a more nearly homogeneous reserve globule
and having imbedded in it a somewhat flattened refringent body.
The internal organization of the resting zygospore here as in the
several congeneric forms and in most other members of the Zo-
épagaceae would seem to correspond to the unitary organization
familiar in the resting oospores of many oomycetes, including most
species of Pythium and all species of Aphanomyces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the individual zygospores are produced close to the host pel-
licle in numbers ranging usually from 10 to 25 (1c. 5, K, a-y)—
the greatest number noted was 37—and are of durable character,
they arrest attention by their clustered arrangement for months
after all vestiges of their protozoan hosts have vanished from sight.
In some plate cultures many were observed being invaded and de-
stroyed by a hyphomycete that developed mainly through parasitism
on the oospores of Pythium mamillatum. Though a mycelial con-
nection could not be traced the hyphomycete in question was most
probably Trinacrium subtile Fres., since the distinctive conidia of
that oospore parasite were present in some abundance. The same
hyphomycete also parasitized many specimens of the testaceous
rhizopod Arcella vulgaris Ehrenb. that were distributed on the
surface of the agar, and further invaded numerous globose cysts
which had been produced in the cultures by a member of the
Myxobacteriaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

studied were obtained from the herbarium of the Taiwan Agri-
cultural Research Institute, the herbarium of the National Univer-

[@The first record of Ustilaginales from Taiwan was made by P.
Hennings (1). He recorded three species, among which Ustilago
digitariae (Kze.) Rabh. has not been reported since under that name
although it is probable that it is the same species now known as
Sorosporium formosanum Saw. Later both Sawada and Ito stud-
ied this group of fungi from this region. All the species recorded
by them have been examined by the writer and several of the
species described by them have been reduced to synonymy, with the
result that the total number of species previously reported from
the island has been reduced to forty-six.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since several species described by Sawada after 1935 were not
provided with Latin diagnoses, these are supplied here to legitima-

also impressed by the occurrence of conidia in nature, which is very
unusual for Tilletia. Those facts led him to place it in the genus
Entyloma.#Misc-exposition*]

its original description the presence of sori on leaves and leaf
sheaths was neglected. T. youngii, however, has larger spores

[@Bubak transferred this species to Elateromyces because of the
presence in the sorus of remnants of host tissue which resemble
“elaters” superficially. Sydow accordingly placed it in Farysia.
Ciferri established the genus Liroa based on the same fungus.
His genus is separated from Farysia by its habit of forming galls
on various parts of Polygonum and its spore formation in lysigenous
cavities. These features, however, do not form a sound basis for
generic distinctions and especially fail to separate the genus Liroa
from Ustilago. Ciferri also believed that the sporogenesis in this
fungus was typical of the Graphiolaceae. On the contrary, Mund-
kur and Thirumalachar (4) ascertained that the spore formation
conformed to that of the Ustilaginaceae. Their studies on the
anatomy of the tumor led them to emphasize the formation of an
inverted lunate bed of sporogenous tissue restricted to the apical
region of the tumor as the most characteristic feature of the genus.
This feature, however, is by no means constant even in the species
concerned. The fungus attacks the inflorescence as well as the
stem, but such inverted lunate beds of sporogenous tissue can he
traced out only in the conical outgrowths on the stem. If the
fungus manifests itself only in the floral parts, as is often the case,
this diagnostic feature will not be present. Moreover, the occur-
rence of “elater”-like strands of host tissue is not unusual in other
species of the Ustilaginaceae. Certain collections of ovaricolous
Ustilago on Polygonum do have such host remnants intermixed
with spores. In Sorosporium tanganikeanum Zundel, the *'yellow-
ish shreds” mentioned in its original description (7) are also very#Misc-exposition*]

12-14 µm. A comparison of collections from Taiwan and from the
Philippines (Herb. Bureau of Science, P. I. No. 4864), however,
revealed a close similarity in their spore size, being 10.5-16.5 x
10.5-13.5 aµm and 11.5-17.2 x 10.5-13.5 p respectively. The spores
of the Taiwan collection were also more reddish colored than those
of the Philippine collection. Notwithstanding the slight variation,
these two collections can be reasonably well referred to one species.
The presence of a central columella and a pallid false membrane in
the sorus indicates that it belongs to Sphacelotheca.#Misc-exposition*]

exception is a collection from India on that host, which has spore-

[@This parasite occurred in cultures of K. rosea which had been
isolated and grown on bits of onion skin in a water and soil sample
collected from a stagnant pool in a pig pen near Frederick, Mary-
land in April, 1948. Within two weeks after the host sporangia
had developed in the substratum a large number of them were found
to be infected, and in the course of a month the disease had reached
epidemic proportions in several of the cultures. In such cultures
as high as fifty-two per cent of the sporangia were parasitized, but
in others infection was less severe and even lacking. The epidemic
began to subside in six weeks, and after two months no trace of the
parasite, except its resting spores, could be found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As far as present studies go, this fungus appears to be an obli-
gate parasite of K. rosea. All attempts to infect cultures of

[@In general appearance this species is strikingly similar to
Olpidium Rhisophlyctidis recently described by Sparrow (1948)
as a parasite of a variant of the same host, and the two species might
be easily mistaken until the zoospores are examined and compared.
As shown in figures 1-3, one or several parasites develop in a host
sporangium, and in exceptional cases as many as fifty-six have heen
observed in one host cell. In such instances the size of the para-
site is relatively small, depending on the number present. In
cases of single infection the subsequent thallus may almost fill the#Misc-exposition*]

[@host sporangium (FIG. 3). When multiple infection occurs one
or more of the thalli may become relatively large and crowd the
smaller ones towards the periphery (FIGS. 1, 2). If several thalli
develop equally in size and become large, the resulting sporangia
may be distinctly angular in outline from mutual contact and
pressure.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The effect of the parasite on the host is fairly constant. No
marked enlargement of the sporangia occurs, and only occasionally#Misc-exposition*]
[@KARLING: A NEW OLIPIDIOPSIS PARASITE 273#Misc-exposition*]

[@are they malformed or distorted. This may occur in cases of
multiple infection as the parasites enlarge and cause local bulging
of the sporangium wall (FIG. 16). So far no physical antagonism
between the host and parasite protoplasm has been observed. The
host protoplasm usually aggregates in a dense layer around the
parasites (FIGS. 13, 14) without any marked zone of antagonism,
as in other species of Olpidiopsis. As the parasites enlarge, the
host protoplasm is largely absorbed, and finally only a residual
layer remains around the mature parasites (Figs. 1, 2, 5, 6, 15).
However, in two cases of single infection only a portion of the
host protoplasm was absorbed, while the remainder underwent
cleavage and formed normal zoospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The method of infection and development of the parasite within
the host are fundamentally similar to those of other Olpidiopsis
species. As shown in figure 12 the zoospore comes to rest on the
host cell and forms a short germ or penetration tube through which
its content passes into the host protoplasm. The empty zoospore
case soon becomes wrinkled, collapses and disappears. The newly-
entered parasite is difficult to see in the pink or rosy host proto-
plasm, and it is frequently completely obscured. However, as it
grows and increases in size it becomes more clearly distinguishable
with a well-defined wall, which may often be surrounded by a layer
of rosy or reddish, refringent globules from the host protoplasm
(FIG. 13). In the young stages the protoplasm of the parasite has
a grayish refractive appearance like that of other species of Olpidi-
opsis and usually includes several refractive bodies. As it in-
creases in size small vacuoles appear in the cytoplasm (FIG. 14),
and with continued growth and development these increase in num-
ber and size (FIGS. 3,4). Eventually and usually they coalesce to
form one large irregular central vacuole, but in some thalli they may
remain relatively small and numerous and retain their entity after
cleavage has been completed (FIG. 2) as Barrett (1912) -described
for O. vexans. By this time the protoplasm of the parasite has
an even but coarsely, grayish granular appearance (FIGS. 1-4), and
the refractive material appears to be highly dispersed. The incipi-
ent discharge tube begins as a low broad papilla which then elongates
and usually grows out through an exit papilla of the host (FIGS.
4—6). Occasionally, it may perforate and push through the host#Misc-exposition*]
[@274 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@wall directly (FIG. 2). As noted elsewhere, it may be short and
broad (FIGS. 2, 6) or elongate, curved, rarely branched (FIG. 5),
and tapered toward the apex. In mature sporangia with a large
central vacuole, the protoplasm usually forms a scalloped layer
around the vacuole. Broad V-shaped cleavage furrows form at
the border of the vacuole (FIG. 5), progress to the periphery, and
thus delimit the zoospore initials. The cleavage segments are
well defined at first, but soon become obscured as they increase in
size. Shortly after this stage the tip of the discharge tube deli-
quesces and the zoospore initials flow out (FIG. 6) and form a
globular quiescent mass. After a short while they separate and
start rocking back and forth as the flagella begin to beat. At this
stage the zoospores are somewhat irregular in shape (FIG. 7) with-
out easily recognizable anterior and posterior ends and ventral
grooves, but as the rocking continues they mature and assume defin-
itive shape and organization. The rocking movement becomes in-
creasingly rapid, and within 2 to 3 minutes the zoospores swim
away. So far no swarming of the zoospores in a vesicle outside of
the sporangia has been observed. However, discharge and ma-
turation of the zoospore initials has been seen only a few times,
and it is possible that the process and behavior described above may
be exceptional instead of general.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mature zoospore is reniform with a tapering anterior and a
rounded posterior end (FIG. 8) and contains from 30 to 50 granules.
In the latter respects they resemble very closely those of Lagenidiuim
Distylae, L. humanum (Karling, 1944, 1947) and species of
Pythium. The two unequal flagella are inserted in the ventral
groove and extend in opposite directions. In swimming the zoo-
spore rotates slowly on one axis, and the anterior flagellum beats
more rapidly than the posterior one, which often appears to be
dragged along behind. After swimming about for one-half to
three-fourths of an hour, the zoospores slow up, come to rest, re-
tract their flagella and round up (FIG. 11). So far no evidence of
diplanetism has been observed, and if the zoospores do not come
to rest on a host cell and germinate they degenerate within a few
minutes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As noted previously, the resting spores are apparently formed
asexually. No evidence of fusion between so-called male and fe-#Misc-exposition*]

[@male thalli has been found. Up to a certain stage the development
of the incipient resting spore is very similar to that of the sporangia,
and the two are difficult to distinguish in the young stages. How-
ever, the wall of the incipient spore soon begins to thicken, and
the content becomes more densely granular (FIG. 16). At the
same time the small vacuoles usually coalesce and form a larger
central one (FIGS. 15, 16) which may be irregular or spherical in
shape and up to 10µm in diameter in exceptional cases. On the
other hand, it is not uncommon to find mature spores with 2 or 3
small vacuoles (FIG. 17). Like the sporangia, the resting spores
may occur singly or in large numbers in a host cell (FIG. 16). In
rare cases as many as 43 were found in one host sporangium, which
was distorted by the tightly packed spores. So far germination of
the resting spores has not been observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In connection with the description of this new species it may be
noted that other related members of the Olpidiopsidaceae were
found and isolated in soil and water collections from various parts
of Maryland. These are: Pythiella vernalis (Couch, 1935) para-

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@Olpidiopsis Karlingiae is an endobiotic parasite of the sporangia
of the chytrid Karlingia rosea. It developed in a culture of this
host which had been isolated on bits of onion skin from a soil
and water sample near Frederick, Maryland in April, 1948. It is
characterized by a monocentric holocarpic thallus, spherical, oval,
pyriform or oblong sporangia, with a broad, short or long discharge#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCERNING THE IDENTITY OF ITER-
SON'S CELLULOLYTIC MYCOGONE#Misc-exposition*]

[@William W. Diehl#Misc-exposition*]

[@In various published discussions of the role of fungi in relation to
aerobic deterioration of cellulosic materials there are references to
one of the two pioneer research papers by the Dutch microbiologist,
Iterson (1, 2), in which among a list of fifteen species of fungi the
most active one was reported under the name Mycogone puc-
cinioides (Preuss) Sacc. (syn. Blastotrichum puccinioides Preuss).
Since Iterson's account was published this name has been quoted
liberally in various articles concerned with deterioration ot fabrics
and other cellulosic materials, notably in the well-known compen-
dium by Thaysen and Bunker (3). In that compendium the
brief description of Blastotrichum puceinioides agrees, unfortu-
nately, with the original description of that species by Preuss (4)
rather than with Iterson’s records. Preuss’s Blastotrichum puc-
cinioides was described and illustrated as having septate spores from
a mycelium growing on a mushroom and was distinctly different
from the amerosporous organism so identified by Iterson (l.c.).
A review of the literature of cellulolytic deterioration suggests the
likelihood that specific agents variously referred also to species of
the form-genera Acremonium, Acremoniella, Sepedonium, Monoto-
spora, etc., may well be closely related, if not the same, species as
that reported by Iterson, but it is convenient to restrict the present
discussion to the identity of Iterson’s oft-cited fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the cultures frequently obtained from decaying cotton
fabrics is a dark-spored hyphomycete which has features suggesting
the likelihood of its identity with Iterson’s fungus. I first isolated
it in pure culture in 1945 from a cotton fabric which had recently
suffered decay through use in military operations in the South Pa-
cific area. It was isolated readily using a modification of Iter-
son's (Lc.) technique in recovering the organism which grew most
rapidly following the placing of a bit of the decayed fabric as inocu-
lum upon sterile filter paper lying on a petri-dish plate of sterile#Misc-exposition*]

[@277#Misc-exposition*]
[@278 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@mineral salts agar. With filter paper as the sole source of carbon
the black-spored fungus that grew over the filter paper was obvi-
ously the active agent in its decomposition. This same fungus had
previously been encountered and isolated by P. B. Marsh and
Katharina Bollenbacher in the course of studies of the etiology of
fabric deterioration. They had isolated it from fabrics after ex-
posure to the elements in various parts of the world and have
since recovered it also from cotton fabrics that had been buried ex-
perimentally in native soils at Beltsville, Maryland. These iso-
lates, although showing much variation among themselves and in-
cidentally much given to sectoring, appeared enough alike to be
considered one species, which is here identified as Humicola fusco-
atra Traaen (5). This species was originally described from a
culture isolated from soil in Norway and has since been recorded
from the U. S. by Mason (6) after examination of a culture sent
to him by Dr. S. A. Waksman as an isolate from soil in New
Jersey. Most curiously this specific name appears to have been
accorded little or no attention by workers concerned either with
soil microbiology or with problems of cellulolytic deterioration; if
the species was encountered, as seems likely, it has been reported
under different names. It seems especially odd also that no
consideration has been given to Iterson’s fungus under the name
Humicola since Traaen (l.c.) himself suggested that it might be
the same as his species H. grisea. It appears to me, however, that
Traaen’s suggestion is confusing because the spore dimensions of
his H. grisea, “12-17 µm,” are very different from those that may be
calculated from Iterson’s illustrations of his cellulolytic fungus.
By measuring the spores as shown by Iterson and calculating their
sizes in the light of the stated magnification they measure 7.25~
8.18 x, which is well within the dimensions "6-9-12 4" as given by
Traaen for his H. fusco-atra. It is, furthermore, pertinent to note
that the cultures of cellulolytic fungi isolated by Dr. Marsh and his
associates and by myself, which I have referred to H. fusco-atra,
are very similar to the culture of H. fusco-atra kindly furnished me
in 1945 by Dr. S. A. Waksman ; this was a transfer from the same
original Waksman isolate reported as H. fusco-atra by Mason
(l.c.) after his comparison of it with Traaen's original type culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DIEHL: ITERSON’S CELLULOLYTIC MYCOGONE 279#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to its practical bearing on studies of deterioration
of cellulosic materials and of soil microbiology this species is of
concern nomenclatorially. Mason (l.c.), who has given critical
consideration to the two different form-genera Monotospora of
Saccardo and Monotospora of Corda, considered Traaen’s H.
grisea in the former as a synonym of M. daleae Mason and H.
fusco-atra as referable to the latter. He pointed out that, if
Monotospora of Saccardo should be conserved against Corda’s prior
name, Humicola as a synonym of the discarded Monotospora of
Corda would then be legitimate with H. fusco-atra Traaen as the
type species. Because of its convenience this should be a welcome
taxonomic disposition of that hitherto debated form-genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the course of a cursory study of some species of Phakopsora
deposited in the Pennsylvania State College herbarium, interesting
features were noticed in some of the species which warranted a re-
study. Comparative studies of the related genera of Phakopsora
were made in order to have a better knowledge of the morphology
of the spore forms for improving our taxonomic concepts of the
group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Phakopsora Dietel (1895) was based on Phakopsora
punctiformis on Galium aparine collected in India by Barclay.
Dietel (1890), calling the rust a Melampsora, emphasized the fact
that the teliospore crusts had spores which were not arranged in
chains, a, condition brought about by younger teliospores develop-
ing and pushing into the sorus between older ones (FIG. 3). While
this feature of teliospore production is accepted by us, and by most
uredinologists, the need for confirmation by examination of the
type of the genus still remains. An attempt to locate the type
specimen at Kew Herbarium has been unsuccessful. The mode of
spore development in chains, or in irregular succession, has been
used recently in separating rust genera. Some of the results of
studies on the Phakopsora species are presented here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phakopsora dominicana Kern (1928) was described as a micro-
cyclic rust-species on Croton angustatus. The material was col-
lected in Santo Domingo by Dr. C. E. Chardon. The telia are
formed on slightly hypertrophied spots, black, and densely crowded.
A careful re-study of the material indicated that the sori are deep-
seated developing chains of one-celled, golden-brown teliospores in
succession. The telial chains are compactly grouped showing some
lateral coalescence, but can be separated by manipulation. The de-
veloping chains of spores rupture through the epidermis so that the#Misc-exposition*]

are very obvious, but less distinct or obscure in some others, where
also they do occur in catenulations. The thinness and plane of
sectioning are also of importance in determining the teliospore
chains. The rust on Randia armata is an Angiopsora on account
of the occurrence of teliospore chains. Since Sydow’s P. melaena#Misc-exposition*]

superposed layers of teliospores. Careful examination of telia
of P. venezuelana revealed that the teliospores are superposed in
chains and following our present concept of separating Angiopsora
from Phakopsora, the rust should be placed under Angiopsora as
A. venezuelana (Sydow) n. comb.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Physopella Burserae was described by Sydow (1925) as a leat
rust on Bursera gummifera in Costa Rica. The rust was de-
scribed only in the uredial stage, but taking into account the
characteristic incurved paraphyses surrounding the sorus and en-
closing sessile urediospores, Sydow placed it under Physopella.
The genus Physopella has been merged with Cerotelium or with
Phakopsora in the absence of telial structures. Several of the spe-
cies of Physopella based upon uredial stages have proved to be
Phakopsora when the telial stages have been found. Physopella
(= Cerotelium) desmium and P. Cherimoliae, for instance, have
been shown to be species of Phakopsora by Cummins.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A careful examination of specimens of Physopella Burserae
distributed by Sydow (Fungi exotici exsiccati 600, which bears
the same date and place of collection as the type specimen) reveals
the occurrence of telia. The telia appear microscopically as small
brownish-black specks distributed among the uredia. In sections
they are lenticular, non-erumpent, with golden-brown teliospores
developing in irregular succession and not in chains. Since the
telial stage has been discovered, the following change in nomencla-
ture is proposed, Phakopsora Burserae (Sydow) n. comb.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phakopsora Meliosmae was described by Kusano (1904) on
the leaves of Meliosma myrianthae from Japan. The telia were
said to be covered by the epidermis, with 3-4 superposed, polyhedral
spores which were thin-walled and light brown. An authentic
specimen of Phakopsora Meliosmae collected by Kusano, and dis-
tributed in "Vestergren's Micromycetes Rarius selecti No. 1558,"
was carefully sectioned and examined. The uredia are hypophyl-
lous and possess the incurved paraphyses of the Phakopsora-type.#Misc-exposition*]
[@288 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@The telia are non-erumpent, lenticular, and the teliospores are cu-
boid and in distinct chains. The rust is a species of Angiopsora and
the combination A. Meliosmae (Kusano) n. comb. is proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A leaf rust on Ampelopsis heterophylla, collected by Shirai near
Tokyo, was described by Dietel (1898) as Phakopsora Ampelop-
sidis Dietel & Sydow. In the next year P. Sydow (1899) de-
scribed another species Phakopsora vitis on Parthenocissus Thun-
bergii. The urediospores were stated to be more elongated, and
the teliospores larger, in P. vitis than in P. Ampelopsidis. Nao-
haru Hiratsuka (1900) made a comparative study of the two and
found them to be identical. He therefore reduced P. vitis as a
synonym of P. Ampelopsidis. This disposition was maintained
in later studies on the Phakopsora by Naohide Hiratsuka of Japan
(1935). A collection of the rust on Ampelopsis heterophylla col-
lected in Japan in 1929, and distributed as Phakopsora Vitis
(Thiim.) Sydow, has been available for our study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The uredia are sub-epidermal, erumpent, encircled by incurved
paraphyses and open by a pore at the top. The telia are
numerous, appearing as brownish-black specks. They are non-
erumpent, lenticular, with cuboid to globular teliospores occurring
in definite chains. The catenulations of the teliospores are well
illustrated by the Sydows (Monographia Uredinearum 3: 415,
Tab. XVII, FIG. 153. 1914). The rust on Ampelopsis hetero-
phylla is an Angiopsora according to our present concept of the
genus, and is transferred as Angiopsora Ampelopsidis (Dietel &
Sydow) n. comb. Phakopsora Vitis Sydow is regarded as a
synonym.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Studies of Phakopsora and related genera indicate that there
is some confusion in separating the genera. Species described as
Phakopsora have been placed later under Angiopsora, Arthuria and
Baeodromus. Dasturella was based upon Angiopsora divina Syd.
Rust species with only uredial stages have been placed under
Cerotelium or Phakopsora on the. basis of presence of hyphoid
peridium and paraphyses in the sorus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PIGMENT PRODUCTION IN THE DIFFER-
ENTIATION OF TRICHOPHYTON MEN-
TAGROPHYTES AND TRICHOPHYTON
RUBRUM#Misc-exposition*]

[@Florante C. Bocobo, M.D.* and Rhoda W. Benham, Ph.D.**#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two most common fungi concerned in the etiology of derma-
tophytosis of the feet are Trichophyton mentagrophytes (gypseum)
and Trichophyton rubrum. The frequency with which these two
species occur was shown by Hopkins et al. (1) in a comparative
compilation of figures obtained by different workers. Out of 1,700
cultures, 47 per cent were identified as Trichophyton gypseum
(mentagrophytes) and 36 per cent as Trichophyton rubrum.
Ariyevich and Pentkovskaya (2) reported that the organism most
frequently causing epidermophytosis of the feet in U.S.S.R. was, as
in most European countries, Epidermophyton Kaufmann-W olf
(Trichophyton gypseum). Trichophyton gypseum (mentagro-
phytes) comprised 94.5 per cent, and Trichophyton rubrum 3.2 per
cent of 533 cultures they obtained. Trichophyton rubrum was the
preponderant causative organism isolated by Mu and Kurotchkin
(3) from cases of tinea of the feet, hands, nails and body observed
in Peiping, China. Out of 134 cultures gathered, 110 were deter-
mined as Trichophyton rubrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It can thus be seen that in the routine work of a dermatomycologic
clinic where one of the largest groups of patients are those afflicted
with dermatophytosis, the problem of species differentiation of T.
gypseum and T. rubrum is frequently encountered. The desir-
ability of this differentiation has been emphasized in the light of
prognostic and therapeutic considerations. In typical cases, T.
gypseum infections run a more acute inflammatory course and are
amenable to treatment while those of T. rubrum are of chronic,
mildly inflammatory character and resistant to medication. Lewis,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Montgomery and Hopper (4) considered the chronic nature, dull
red color, slight branny scaling and presence of concomitant lesions
as suggestive of T. rubrum infections while a short, rapid course
marked by dyshidrosis and more acute inflammatory reaction is
suspicious of T. gypseum infection. Diagnosis based on the above
clinical criteria, however, cannot be made with certainty as at not
a few times, the same kind of lesion may be produced by different
fungi and the same fungus may cause several types of lesions.
Hopkins et al. (1), although agreeing to some extent with the
differential points given by Lewis and co-workers, concluded from
their experiences that the differences are essentially inconstant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The final proof for the differentiation of the two types of infec-
tion lies in the isolation and identification of the causative organism.
At present, the diagnosis is based mainly on the colony character-
istics and on morphologic studies in culture mounts. One of us
(R. W. B.) (5) listed the distinguishing features as:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bocobo and Benham: Pigment Production 293#Misc-exposition*]

[@These criteria are useful in typical isolates, but again they are no-
toriously inconstant so that difficulties arise, particularly when,
as is not infrequent, pleomorphic and variant forms develop and
obscure the cultural picture. The gross appearance of isolates of
the same species may vary from one another, and even the same
strain may vary with age and with different media. The diagnostic
microscopic structures, such as the spirals and the macroconidia,
may be absent, and the culture mount then loses its value as an aid
for diagnosis. It is because of this inconsistent behavior that no
single property can be regarded as reliable for identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As its name implies, T. rubriin. produces a. characteristic deep
rose purple to wine red pigment best seen on the under side of the
colony, and this property has been used as one of its main differ-
entiating points from T. mentagrophytes. Lewis and Hopper (6)
reported their failure to encounter a single strain that did not ac-
quire a rose purple pigmentation when first isolated. Although the
authors were able to maintain the original color of many cultures
for three years, they admit that certain strains may lose their pig-
ments after repeated subcultures. This loss of ability to elaborate
pigment by certain fungi after the primary isolation is well known
and is particularly true for Trichophyton violaceum. Another
complicating observation that may be a source of confusion was
made by one of us (R. W. B.) (5) that some strains with the
morphology of T. mentagrophytes acquired the rose purple pig-
mentation characteristic of T. rubrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is of interest then to study the behavior of pigment produc-
tion by T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum as an aid in the specific
differentiation of these two pathogenic fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On Sabouraud dextrose agar, the early pigmentation of T.
mentagrophytes colonies appeared as yellow to yellow-tan to rose-
tan which deepened with age approaching the red-purple color of
T. rubrum in some strains. The earlier pigmentation of many
strains of T. rubrum colonies was not characteristic, ranging from
yellowish cream to dull brown, but it eventually acquired the
characteristic purplish hue. The color usually started at the
center and gradually spread toward the enlarging edges of the
colony. The pigment in some cultures became diffuse throughout.
The others left a yellow-tan to rose-tan border.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On potato dextrose agar, the undersurface color of the T. menta-
grophytes cultures ranged from cream to light tan to rose-tan, and
even to actual rose-purple in a few strains. These last five strains
were noteworthy for they acquired, particularly in older cultures on
potato dextrose agar, a pigmentation that approached and was
easily confusable with the red-purple pigmentation of T. rubrum.

intense with a more pronounced purplish tint.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several investigators, including Mosher et al. (10), Robbins
and Ma (9) and Archibald and Reiss (11), have reported signifi-
cant differences in growth of pathogenic fungi on mediums con-
taining different amino acids or their combinations. Preliminary
experiments of our own with a few strains of T. mentagrophytes and
T. rubrum showed that different amino acids and combinations of
them used as nitrogen sources do affect pigment production. It is
planned to continue the study of this question.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While the presence of vitamins, especially thiamine, is generally
accepted as desirable for growth, these essential growth factors do
not seem to influence pigment production decisively. Lewis and
Hopper (6) reported that the incorporation of vitamins A, B com-
plex, B,, B,, G, biotin, C and D in a medium with lactose as the
only source of carbohydrate did not permit pigment production by
T. rubrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another factor to be considered in pigment formation is the min-
eral content of the substrate. Foster (12) discussed the relation-
ships between metal assimilation and pigment production by fungi
in his review and Nickerson and Williams (13) advised investiga-
tions of the dermatophytes along these lines.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The results with the different sugars essentially confirm those
of Lewis and Hopper (6). Three of the monosaccharides tested
served to produce pigment, one (galactose) did not; another evid-
ence of the specificity of enzymes for each optical isomer. In their
growth experiments with T. gypseum, Goddard (14) and Mosher
et. al. (10) failed to demonstrate lactase, and Tate (15), invertase,
zymase or inulase. None of the di- or polysaccharides were utilized
for pigment formation although all but inulin aided growth. In-
ference may be made that the enzyme systems responsible for the
elaboration of pigment may be different from those necessary for
growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Much study has been made of the influence of hydrogen ion con-
centration on the growth and pigmentation of dermatophytes.
Tate (16), Goddard (14), Peck and Rosenfeld (17) and Leise and
James (18) showed that the dermatophytes they examined were#Misc-exposition*]
[@BOCOBO AND BENHAM: PIGMENT PRODUCTION 299#Misc-exposition*]

[@not fastidious as to their pH environments and can grow quite easily
in a wide range of hydrogen ion concentrations from pH 3.5 to pH
11.0. Lewis and Hopper (6) were unable to note any appreciable
difference in pigment production by T. rubrum when using peptone
crude dextrose agar at pH 4, 5,6, and 7. In the present investiga-
tion, changes in hydrogen ion concentration within the range of
pH 4.0 to pH 8.0 also failed to affect notably the pigmentation on
Sabouraud dextrose agar, potato dextrose agar, and blood agar base
dextrose. This, however, was not true of corn meal dextrose agar
and casein hydrolysate dextrose agar. As already noted, T. rubrum
failed to develop its purple pigment in the most acid of these media,
although it acquired a cream to yellow color. Nickerson (19) ob-
served the development of a yellow color in a mixed culture of T.
rubrum and Candida albicans on corn meal agar when the medium
was acid; however, this same strain of T. rubrum, when grown
alone on corn meal agar, produced the red color when the medium
was alkaline. It is noteworthy that the cream to yellow pigmenta-
tion observed at the undersurface of the colonies of T. rubrum on a
medium initially at a pH of 4.0 and 4.5 changed to purple or lav-
ender upon dropping sodium hydroxide solution on the colony.
Tate (16) extracted the pigments from T. rubrum and T. gypseum
and found them to be yellow in acid solution changing to red or
reddish brown in alkaline solution. Thompson (20) confirmed
Tate’s further findings that in alkaline solution the dermatophyte
pigments had a yellow, reduced, and a red, oxidized form. Both
color changes accompanying differences in pH and in oxidation-
reduction potentials are easily reversible. Nickerson (19) con-
sidered the possibility that the dermatophytes produce only one
pigment with the pH and the oxidation-reduction potential of the
culture determining the characteristic color. This is rather intrigu-
ing in the light of the marked variations of the behavior and appear-
ance of pigment production among dermatophytes in the different
media and warrants further investigations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As regards the practicality of the results of the present investiga-
tion in the differentiation of T. mentagrophytes and T. rubrum, the
differences in the undersurface pigmentation of the two species on
corn meal dextrose agar may be used as a diagnostic aid. It seems#Misc-exposition*]
[@300 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@that the purple pigmentation of T. rubrum is developed most in-
tensely and characteristically on potato dextrose agar, and to a
lesser degree on Sabouraud dextrose agar, as observed by Lewis
and Hopper (6) and Edgecombe (7); but on the other hand,
atypical strains of T. mentagrophytes may acquire reddish pigmen-
tation on these media that may cause confusion. Although the
purple pigmentation on corn meal dextrose agar was marked, T.
mentagrophytes acquired no pigmentation at all while T. rubrum
developed a red, or at least pinkish pigmentation on the undersur-
face. This should be a help in differentiating atypical strains of T.
mentagropliwtes and. T. rubrum when other features are indecisive.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. The pigment production of 50 strains of T. mentagrophytes
and 40 strains of T. rubrum was studied on Sabouraud dextrose
agar, potato dextrose agar, corn meal dextrose agar and ammonium
chloride dextrose agar. It appeared that the appearance of pig-
ment on the undersurface depended not only on the presence of
dextrose, but also on the source of nitrogen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. The strains of T. mentagrophytes examined did not produce
any pigment on corn meal dextrose agar while those of T. rubrum
developed the characteristic red purple color in 38 of the 40 strains
examined. The other two strains produced pinkish pigmentation
on the undersurface not seen on any strain of T. mentagrophwtes.
This observation is suggested as an aid in differentiation of the two
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. T. rubrum was able to utilize dextrose, mannose and levulose
for pigment production, but failed to do so with inulin, raffinose,
lactose, maltose, sucrose and galactose.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. Pigment production by the strains studied on Sabouraud dex-
trose agar, potato dextrose agar and blood agar base dextrose buf-
fered at different pH levels from pH 4.0 to 8.0 was not appreciably
affected although the T. rubrum cultures on casein hydrolysate dex-
trose agar at pH 4.0 and on corn meal dextrose agar at pH 4.0 and
4.5 acquired only a cream to yellow pigmentation instead of red
purple which appeared at other pH levels.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(WITH 2 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Blastomyces dermatitidis, the causative organism of North Amer-
ican blastomycosis, is characterized by the development (a) of
aerial hyphae with numerous microconidia at room temperature,
and (b) of large thick-walled predominantly single-budding cells
at 37°C. The mycelial phase has been grown on a wide variety of
complex media at room temperature, but the budding or yeastlike
phase has been grown principally on beef-infusion or blood agars at
37° C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The process of conversion from one growth phase to the other
has been studied since the turn of this century, but is still not
completely understood. Ricketts (8) and Hamburger (4) were
among the first to examine the growth of the fungus "in vitro," and
indicated that temperature was a most influential factor in deter-
mining the morphologic type. This fact has since been confirmed
by others, such as Michelson (7), DeMonbreun (3), and Levine
and Ordal (6). Levine and Ordal (6) also reported pH as being
relatively unimportant in determining the type of growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Almost all this work, however, has been done in complex and
not chemically defined media. Hence, little is known about the
possible influence of nutrient factors on the conversion of the or-
ganism from one phase to the other. Investigations were therefore
initiated on the nutritional requirements of the yeastlike and my-
celial phases. This paper reports the effect of growth factors,
amino acids and carbohydrates on the development of B. derma-
titidis in the mycelial and yeastlike phases.#Misc-exposition*]

were from the collection maintained in this laboratory, and were#Misc-exposition*]

[@originally isolated from cases of human blastomycosis in south-
eastern United States. The mycelial phases of the fungi were
maintained on Sabouraud’s dextrose agar at 25° C., while the bud-
ding forms were kept on 20 per cent rabbit blood agar at 37° C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basic medium used for the study of the nutritional require-
ments of the strains under investigation was as follows:

[@When the budding phases were to be grown, 1.8 g./liter of a ni-
trogen-containing compound and 2.5 g./liter of a sugar were added
to the above medium. When the mycelia were to be grown, 14
g./liter of a nitrogen-containing compound and 10 g./liter of a
sugar were added. All the studies were made in a semifluid me-
dium, since such a medium promoted better development of the
yeastlike phase than an agar slant, and also permitted quantitative
determination of the growth. In the experiments in which the
growth-factor requirements of the fungi were investigated, the agar
was washed for a minimum of 5 days in running tap water, then
rinsed in distilled water and dried. The medium, after adjustment
to pH 7.0, was generally dispensed in 8 ml. quantities in test tubes,
and after inoculation with the fungus incubated either at 37° C. in
sealed tubes for 2-3 weeks for the budding phases, or at 25° C. for
6-8 weeks for the mycelial phases. The inoculum was either (a) a
loopful of a dense washed suspension of microconidia and mycelial
fragments in saline, or (b) 0.05 ml. ofa washed suspension of about
1,000,000 cells per ml. When necessary, cells were counted in a
Levy haemacytometer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The phenomenon of dimorphism, whereby a single species can
appear in two distinct morphologic phases, is quite common among
the pathogenic fungi. For example, Histoplasma capsulatum ap-
pears in the yeastlike phase at 37° C., and in the mycelial at 25° C.
Blastomyces brasiliensis develops as a multiple budding cell at 37°
C., and as a mycelium at 25? C. Coccidioides immitis occurs as
an endospore-forming spherule in the tissue, and as mycelium at
25? C3 Candida albicans has been grown in both the yeastlike
and mycelial phases at both 25? C. and 37? C., with the most in-
fluential morphology-determining factor or factors still in doubt.
Phialophora verrucosa appears as round, dark brown bodies in the
tissue, and as mycelium in culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In some species, such as in Phialophora verrucosa and Coccidi-
oides immitis, the mechanism is not understood. In others, such
as Candida albicans and Histoplasma capsulatum, some experi-
mentation has provided a partial explanation of the processes in-
volved. The yeastlike phase of H. capsulatum does not always oc-
cur at 37° C., but must have certain other factors present (9).
(a) Biotin must be an ingredient of the medium. (b) A reduced-
sulfur group such as the sulfhydryl group must be included. Thus,
conversion of the yeastlike phase to the mycelium, and vice versa,
may be brought about at 37° C. by changing the amino-acid con-
stitution of the medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Evidence has been accumulating that temperature is the princi-
pal controlling factor in B. dermatitidis (2, 3, 6). However, all
this work, with the exception of some brief studies by Levine and
Ordal (6) in which ammonium sulfate was the nitrogen source,
has been done in complex media the exact chemical composition of
which was not known. Such media included primarily various beef#Misc-exposition*]

[@infusion, peptone or blood agars, and did not permit proper evalu-
ation of the possible effect of the nutrients present in the medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In simple chemically-defined media, however, temperature proved
still to be the main factor determining growth of mycelia and co-
nidia, or growth of large budding cells. At 25° C., growth was al-
ways mycelial; at 37° C., growth was yeastlike, or occasionally
consisted of abortive mycelium (FIG. 1). No growth factor was
found capable of either (a) stimulating growth of either phase or
(b) stimulating conversion of one phase to the other. Although the
yeastlike phase developed slightly in the medium containing the am-
monium ion as the sole nitrogen source, optimum growth appeared
in a medium with amino acids. Glycine, alanine, serine, valine,
glutamic acid, aspartic acid, proline and hydroxyproline stimulated
development most.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These phase-determining characteristics of B. dermatitidis are
much like those of B. brasiliensis (10). (a) The yeastlike phase
of B. brasiliensis appeared at 37° C, in the amino-acid media, with
glycine, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, proline and hydroxy-
proline producing most growth. However, growth was much
slower, more limited in extent, and reverted more readily to an
abortive-mycelium type. (b) Serine and hydroxyproline proved
the most stimulatory of the amino acids, especially in converting
conidia to budding cells of the yeastlike phase at 37° C. (c) No
growth factor was found to have any effect at 37°C. (d) Growth
occurred with or without carbohydrate in the medium. This simi-
larity in growth characteristics between B. dermatitidis and B.
brasiliensis parallels their morphologic similarities, and adds further
evidence to the beliefs of Conant and Howell (2) that the two or-
ganisms belong in the same genus and are very close phylogeneti-
cally.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It now seems certain that the morphology of B. dermatitidis, as
well as of B. brasiliensis, is controlled primarily by temperature
changes. H. capsulatum, however, is determined not only by tem-
perature but also by nutrient factors in the medium. Studies are
bemg conducted to determine what factors are most effective in
regulating the phases of other dimorphic pathogenic fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@The yeastlike phase of B. dermatitidis was grown in a chemically-
defined semifluid medium. Temperature was the most important
environmental factor controlling the type of growth. No amino
acid, carbohydrate or “growth substance” tested was found to be
an essential accessory factor for growth of the yeastlike phase at
37° C. However, the extent of growth of the yeastlike phase did
vary greatly according to the constitution of the medium.#Misc-exposition*]

trichum Populi Sacc. forma Arbuti. Jenkins (l.c.) studied and
illustrated both specimens and showed that the fungus belonged
in the genus Sphaceloma and accordingly made the new combina-

30 x 184. The ascospores are hyaline, 1-septate—probably on
account of being immature—with the upper cell shorter and broader

[@In all the fungi of which the imperfect stage belongs in the genus
Sphaceloma and the perfect stage is known, the latter pertains to
the genus Elsinoé. The presence on the same lesions of acervuli
and sporodochia of Sphaceloma and of ascomata of Elsino? is at
least circumstantial evidence that both are part of the life cycle of
the same organism. It appears therefore legitimate to consider
the ascomata found in the lesions of the spot anthracnose of Arbutus

[@(with 2 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whether Article 57 of the International Rules of Botanical No-
menclature (2, 3), as now worded, applies to the Phycomycetes
or not has been a subject of considerable controversy (1,6). The
first paragraph of Article 57, which consists of two sentences, is the
primary cause of this controversy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The English version of the first sentence reads as follows:
"Among Fungi with a pleomorphic life-cycle the different succes-
sive states of the same species (anamorphoses, status) can bear
only one generic and specific name (binary), that is the earliest
which has been given, starting from Fries, Systema, or Persoon,
Synopsis, to the state containing the form which it has been agreed
to call the perfect form, provided that the name is otherwise in con-
formity with the Rules.” I consider this sentence to contain the
intent of the article and to be unequivocal.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second sentence of the first paragraph merely defines the
perfect state of certain groups of the fungi. It reads as follows:
“The perfect state is that which ends in the ascus stage in the
Ascomycetes, in the basidium in the Basidiomycetes, in the teleuto-
spore or its equivalent in the Uredinales, and in the spore in the
Ustilaginales" That the Phycomycetes are not mentioned in this
second sentence, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, must be
considered an unintentional omission, which in no way influences
the meaning of the first sentence. No other interpretation of the
article, as now worded, seems possible to me.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Phycomycetes, and particularly in the Peronosporaceae,
the “perfect state” has been used sparingly in classification. With
few exceptions identifications can be made, and normally are made,
on the imperfect or asexual stages alone. Indeed, in the absence
of conidiophores and conidia, species of the Peronosporaceae have
been placed in the genus Protomyces [¢.g. Protomyces graminicola
Sacc. = Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroeter; Protomyces
fuscus Peck = Plasmopara pygmaea (Unger) Schroeter].#Misc-exposition*]

[@Numerous mycologists, perhaps the majority, would prefer not
to apply Article 57 to the Phycomycetes. Bisby (1) has proposed
a rewording of this article which would exclude the Phycomycetes.
Bisby (2, p. 89) enounces that a proposal, once made, can be fol-
lowed “unless and until Congress decides against a proposal now
before it.” I would interpret the Rules differently.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems to me that Bisby’s proposal and all others are simply
recommendations which have no standing according to the Rules un-
til acted upon by an International Botanical Congress. If ac-
cepted, they still remain on trial until sanctioned, emended, or re-
jected by the second successive Congress (Art. 71). Since there
is no assurance that any given proposal will be accepted or even
acted upon by the next Congress, and since there is no absolute
certainty as to when the Congress will again convene, the interests
of nomenclatorial stability (Art. 4) are not furthered by following
proposals before they are considered by the Congress.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Before any change in the Rules is adopted, consideration should
be given to the effect the proposed change would have on the no-
menclature of the groups concerned (8). The purpose of this
paper is to point out (1) the proper binomials and author cita-
tions for certain species of the Peronosporaceae according to the
present wording of Article 57 (these binomials are used as head-
ings for the species discussed) ; (2) the binomials and author cita-
tions in common use for these fungi; (3) the binomials that would
be valid if Bisby’s proposed change in Article 57 were incorporated
into the Rules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nomenclature should make apparent the proper binomials and
author citations, either according to the present wording of Article
57 or according to Bisby’s proposal. Discussion has therefore been
limited to those cases of special interest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally it must be pointed out that, in a discussion of nomencla-
torial problems, the distinction between taxonomy and nomencla-
ture is important (8). All decisions about status, whether they
concern individuals or major groups, fall within taxonomy. No-
menclature relates only to the choice of names to be used after these
taxonomic decisions have been made. The two are diametrically
opposed—nomenclature aims at stability; taxonomy, from, its very
nature, is everchanging.#Misc-exposition*]

cussion of taxonomic problems, especially the species concept
within the Peronosporaceae, is reserved for a later paper.#Misc-exposition*]

presents a strong argument in favor of Bisby’s proposed change in

mycological and phytopathological literature, would be preserved
and the new combination would not be necessary. Furthermore, it
seems illogical to base the binomial on the perfect stage, when the
fungus cannot be positively identified if only that stage is present.
The imperfect stage, on the other hand, is diagnostic, and it alone
serves to readily identify the fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

conidiophores of Per. Plantaginis exhibit a more nearly monopodial
type of branching and are stouter; the main branches are straighter,
and the ultimate branches are shorter and stouter. The conidia of
Per. Pluntaginis are somewhat larger (not smaller, as Wilson
(11) states; see original description), are distinctly pointed
basally and somewhat so apically. The oogonia of the two species
are also distinct, those of Per. alta having thin, hyaline walls, while
those of Per. Plantaginis have thick, dark yellow walls. Per.
Plantagnis is therefore placed in de Bary’s section Parasiticae,

[@Type locality : Palisades Interstate Park, New Jersey.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description given above was drawn from unifungal cultures
less than five days old, grown on hemp seed, which-has become the
standard substratum for members of the Saprolegniaceae, in char- -
coal-treated distilled water in petri dishes, at 20? C. A. Sparrowii,
in these cultures, showed a marked resemblance to A. racemosa in
its smooth oogonia, nearly centric oospores, and the general ap-
pearance of the androgynous antheridia. The oospores of A. race-
mosa are, however, sufficiently smaller to prevent confusion of the
two species. Older cultures on hemp seed showed affinities to A.
polyandra, in which the oospores are only slightly smaller than in our
fungus, by an increase in the usual number of oospores in an
oogonium and in the number and length of the antheridial branches.
These hemp-seed cultures, though regularly washed. contained vari-
ous unidentified bacterial contaminants. It seems reasonable to
suppose that, among other factors, available food and oxygen vary
considerably in different parts of the culture and in time.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to determine the degree of variation in the important
sexual characters, which could be produced by changing the method
of culture, Achiya Sparrowii was also grown in pure culture on
(Difco) corn meal agar with 1 g./liter of yeast extract added and
in pure culture in 20 ml. portions (in 250 cc. Erlenmeyer flasks) of
a liquid medium consisting of 5 g./liter yellow corn meal (extracted
by boiling for % hour and centrifuged clear before use) and 1 g./
liter of yeast extract, at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30? C. at
5 degree intervals. The mycelial mats grown in the liquid medium
were transferred to sterile charcoal-treated distilled water in petri
dishes immediately after the formation of the first oogonial initials
(after 3 to 5 days, depending upon the temperature). No growth
occurred at 30? C. under any circumstances. Growth at 10° C.
was quite slow, and the oogonia and oospores formed (on agar
and hemp seed) frequently aborted. No further use, therefore, was
made of these temperatures.#Misc-exposition*]
[@REISCHER: A NEW Species OF ACHLYA 341#Misc-exposition*]

[@Temperature had no obvious effect upon the antheridia; the me-
dium employed, and the age of the culture (in hemp-seed cultures
only), affected the number, origin, size and shape, and the degree
of branching of the antheridial stalks. In young cultures on hemp
seed the antheridia were 1-4, usually 2, to an oogonium, a slight
majority arising from the neck of the oogonium, nearly as many
from the stalk just below the oogonial neck, a few from the spheri-
cal surface of the oogonium. No branching of the antheridial
stalks was observed. Cultures on agar exhibited substantially the
same characteristics. In hemp-seed cultures over five days old.
however, slightly more of the antheridia arise from the oogonial
stalk; the antheridial branches, usually about 25 µm in length in the
younger cultures and those on agar, become elongated loops up to
250 µm in length, exclusive of the antheridium. and the antheridia,
clavate in younger cultures, become tubular, with a diameter
slightly less than that of the antheridial stalk. There may be,
though rarely are, as many as eight antheridia applied to a single
oogonium and, very rarely, the antheridial stalks may branch,
though never the antheridia. Mats grown in the liquid medium
described produce antheridia resembling those of the older hemp-
seed cultures but showing even greater tendency to arise from the
oogonial stalk. The author regards this as an indication that the
change from an A. racemosa (as figured by Coker, 1923. pi. 31, f. 9)
type of antheridial branch to an A. polyandra (as figured by Hilde-
brand, 1867, pl. 16, f. 7-11) type may be caused by the low con-
centration of nutrient materials in the older hemp-seed cultures.
It is unfortunate that more attention has not been paid to the effect
of such environmental factors upon taxonomically critical charac-
teristics. The characters remaining constant throughout our cul-
tures were the androgynous origin of the antheridia, the lack of
branching in the antheridia themselves, and the terminal application
of the antheridia to the oogonium. Since the branching of the an-
theridial stalks of A. polyandra is emphasized in all published de-
scriptions of this species, and A. polyandra is figured with laterally
applied antheridia (Hildebrand, 1867), these characters separate
this closely related species from A. Sparrowni.#Misc-exposition*]

[@minor importance as a separate character, varying from 33 x (one
oospore) to 101 (11 oospores). usually 57 to 77 µm (2 to 4
oospores) in the vounger cultures on hemp seed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Temperatures from 15 to 25° C. had no apparent effect on the
number of oospores formed in the hemp-seed cultures. Three or four
oospores per oogonium were usually produced in the younger cul-
tures, 6 in the older cultures. In cultures on agar the oospore
number did not vary with time but did vary slightly with tempera-
ture: mostly 2-3 oospores at 25° C., 3 at 20° C., and 3-4 at 15° C.
Since a difference of 1 or 2 in the usual number of oospores has not
been used to distinguish species, except where only one oospore is
typically produced, a detailed statistical study was not considered
necessary. Oogonia produced by mats grown on liquid media
usually contained only 1 or 2 oospores, a probable result of lack
of food materials, as similar results are obtained by placing agar
discs containing mycelium in water at room temperature. It is
noteworthy that the usual number of oospores produced does not
approach the 10-15 typical of A. polyandra. In this respect our
fungus resembles A. racemosa (described in Coker, 1923, as hav-
ing usually 2-5 oospores) much more closely.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to ascertain whether a correlation existed between the
number of oospores in an oogonium, and oospore diameter, 321
oospores from hemp-seed cultures grown at 15° C. were measured.
The size of the samples taken was as follows: 22 oospores from oogo-
nia containing 1 oospore ; 50 cospores each from oogonia containing
2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 oospores ; 30 from oogonia containing 7; 9, 7 and 3
oospores from oogonia containing respectively 8, 9 and 10 oospores.
Half of the oospores in each of the larger samples were from cul-
tures 5 days old, half from 8 day cultures. While the diameter of
the oospores reaches extremes of range in oogonia containing only
1 oospore, no significant correlation of diameter with either number
of oospores or age of culture was found. The combined results
(the broken line in figure 1) give a typical distribution curve of
oospore diameter for A. Sparrowii in hemp-seed culture. In de-
termining the effect of temperature on oospore size, measurements
were made, to prevent possible bias, only on oospores (one per
oogonium) in oogonia containing 3 oospores (since singly produced
oospores are apt to be aberrant, and the oospores of oogonia contain-#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new species of Achlya has been described under the name
Achlya Sparrowii, Among the species of Achlya with centric or
slightly subcentric oospores, androgynous antheridia and smooth
oogonial walls there are only two, A. racemosa and A. polvandra,
which closely resemble this fungus. A. Sparrowii may be distin-
guished from A. racemosa quite readily by its much larger oospores,
from A. polyandra by its slightly larger, fewer oospores and the
usually fewer, only rarely branched antheridial stalks with an-
theridia applied to the oogonia by the tip rather than laterally,
The effect of growth in pure culture on liquid and solid media and
of common laboratory temperatures on these characters has been
described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the course of a study of some coprophilous fungi, the author
found what appears to be an undescribed ascomycete resembling
in certain fundamental features fungi placed in the Chaetomiaceae.
The first perithecia were found growing on goat dung and mass
spore inoculations from these were made on potato dextrose agar
and Blakeslee’s No. 230 but on neither media were perithecia pro-
duced or anything other than sterile mycelia, even after two
months, Transfers were made to dung agar and on this medium
perithecia matured normally in less than three weeks and were
identical to those which were found growing naturally on goat dung.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While attending the Chicago meetings of the Mycological So-
ciety of America in December 1947, the author mentioned to Pro-
fessor G. W. Martin the isolates that he had been studying and
Professor Martin indicated immediately that he had obtained a
very similar fungus from a collection made in Peru in 1945.
Professor Martin later very kindly sent cultures of his isolate for
study. It was obvious from the first that the two organisms were
congeneric but specifically distinct. These have been studied side
by side on various types of media and their characteristics and
differences noted. The characteristics of the perithecial walls, the
evanescent asci and light-colored spores, the appendages surround-
ing the ostiole of the perithecium, and the manner in which the asco-
spores are discharged in the form of an elongate cirrus suggest a
relationship to the genus Chaetomium. An examination of the

[@While these species are similar in many respects their differences
are quite marked when the two are compared critically. Cultures
of Lophoirichus mariinii with numerous ascocarps appear td’ be
distinctly darker when examined under low power magnification
due largely to the greater average size of the perithecia and the
much thicker walls of the terminal hairs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When mature, a majority of the terminal hairs of Lophotrichus
ampullus are a millimeter or more in length. Some are highly con-
torted so that they form a loose tangle about the ostiole while many#Misc-exposition*]
[@352 MycoLocia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@others are nearly straight or only slightly curved. These hairs ex-
tend upward and outward above the substrate, and have tips which
are usually curved to circinate, seldom straight. By the time the
ascospores have been discharged into the terminal hairs the neck
has become extremely brittle slightly below the ostiole so that the
least disturbance frees the mass of hairs and spores for subsequent
dispersal.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The terminal hairs of L. martinii are distinctly different from
those of the former species. The majority of them are relatively
short and straight-tipped or are slightly curved to contorted, and
only a few extend to the greater length common for hairs of L.
ampullus. The walls of the hairs of L. martini? are much thicker
than those of L. ampullus and less uniform in thickness through-
out the length of the hair. It is not uncommon to find branching
of the terminal hairs in L. martinii while this phenomenon has not
heen observed in L. ampullus. Spore dispersal is effected as in
the latter species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The relative abundance of perithecia possessing more than one
neck may be a useful characteristic to aid in the separation of these
species. This phenomenon is common to both, but differs greatly
in degree. Perithecia of L. ampullus may develop two necks,
rarely more, but this occurs in a very small percentage of ascocarps.
Perithecia of L. martinii, on the other hand, commonly develop
two to four necks, and the number of such ascocarps may reach 25
per cent or more in any given culture. While all of the necks may
reach the surface of the media, develop terminal hairs and func-
tion normally, some never reach the surface. The development of
terminal hairs does not occur in either speices until the tip of the
neck reaches the surface of the substrate, except occassionally in
very old cultures, and in such cases the pattern of development is
much modified. In rare instances branching of the neck has been
observed, in which case the branch may develop terminal hairs also
and function in spore dispersal.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The family Chaetomiaceae has been defined to include species
which characteristically form ascocarps on the surface of the sub-
strate. Species of Lophotrichus typically produce perithecia par-
tially or entirely submerged with only the ostiole and terminal hairs
exposed. The production of submerged or partially submerged#Misc-exposition*]

[@perithecia is a departure from the usual habit of species of the
Chaetomiaceae. When, however, all characters are taken into
consideration the author believes that Lophotrichus is best ac-
commodated in the Chaetomiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lophotrichus superficially resembles also such genera as Melano-
spora and Cerutostomella in that it possesses an elongate neck with
conspicuous hairs around the ostiole.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the basis of the characteristics of the asci it would seem that
the Chaetomiaceae, and perhaps other fungi whose asci are so very
evanescent, now generally included in the Pyrenomycetes, would
be more logically placed if removed to the Plectomycetes. Cer-
tainly the Chaetomiaceae and the Sordariaceae have little in com-
mon when one considers the nature of the ascus, yet these families
are most frequently placed near each other in the Sphaeriales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new genus, Lophotrichus, including two species, L. ampullus
and L. martinii, is described, which has certain characteristics of
the Chaetomiaceae. The two described species of this genus pro-
duce perithecia which, when grown in culture, are partially or en-
tirely submerged, possess long necks, and have elongate, thick-
walled terminal hairs restricted to the area immediately around the
ostiole. Ascus characteristics are essentially the same as in the
genus Chaetomium. The more or less submerged habit of the
perithecia and the typical long necks are departures from the usual
concepts held for the Chaetomiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

described it as Cercospora vignicola nov. sp. During the past
year, Liu (Bot. Bull. Acad. Sinica 2: 69-80. 1948) reported that
the disease is a conimon one in China on cowpea and soybeans.
He found that leaves and pods of the soybean are attacked by
the fungus, and that the fungus may penetrate into the seeds and
spot them or even prevent them from maturing. Liu prefers
Kawamura’s classification of the pathogen as a Cercospora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present writer remains of the opinion that this fungus
should be classified as a species of Helminthosporium rather than
Cercospora. It is true that if diseased leaves of cowpea and soy-
bean are placed in a moist chamber most of the conidia which are
produced will be long and narrow. But in nature the conidia are
ustally broader, typically less than ten times as long as broad.
At maturity they are quite brown in color. and their walls and
septa become characteristically thickened. Thus the fungus ap-
pears to fit better into the Helminthosporium concept. In view
of these considerations, the writer proposes the following classi-
fication of the fungus: Helminthosporium vignicola (Kawamura)
comb. nov. (Syn. Cercospora vignicola Kawamura; Helmintho-
sporium vignae Olive).—Lindsay S. Olive, Louisiana State Uni-
versity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sanford Myron Zeller was born October 19, 1884 in Coldwater,
Michigan. Like many another scientist son of a minister, he was
born into a home in which culture and education were accepted as
a matter of course, and earlier years of schooling naturally led to
college.#Misc-exposition*]

[@His interest in science was aroused in high school by a
teacher, Miss Burton, whose stimulating presentation and strict
discipline in study methods always remained gratefully and affec-
tionately in his memory. After high school he entered Lawrence
College in Wisconsin, later transferring to Greenville College in
Illinois, which granted him his Bachelor of Science degree in 1909.
At the University of Washington in Seattle, where he later became
instructor in botany, he obtained the degrees of Bachelor and
Master of Arts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A research fellowship in botany at Washington University, St.
Louis, enabled him to receive a Ph.D. at that institution in 1917,
where he remained as special investigator in dendropathology until
his appointment in 1919 as assistant pathologist on the staff of the
Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station at Corvallis. He re-
mained for twenty-nine years of continuous service at this institu-
tion, his official title at the time of his death being Plant Pathologist
and Professor of Plant Pathological Research.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During his years at the University of Washington and at the
Missouri Botanical Garden, several summers were spent at Friday
Harbor Biological Station on Puget Sound, where his main interest
was in algae and fungi. That this interest crystallized on the side
of fungi rather than algae, seems attributable to two circumstances
—one, a visit at that time to the University of Washington by Dr.
W. A. Murrill; the other, an incident which occurred one day as
Dr. and Mrs. Zeller were rowing on the Sound in search of botani-
cal specimens. Landing in a small cove roofed by an overhanging
rock in whose crevices the western maidenhair fern was abundant,
they found embedded among the rhizomes numerous glistening clay-
colored fruiting bodies of an unknown fungus which later proved
to be an undescribed species of Rhizopogon. Subsequently it was
published under the name R. diplophloeus Zeller and Dodge. This
new species of a genus which is largely hypogaeous served as his
introduction to the intriguing subterranean basidiomycetes upon
which he became an undisputed authority. Naturally and neces-
sarily his interest widened to cover the entire field of Gasteromy-
cetes, of which a contemporary internationally known mycologist
‘writes, “He had, in my estimation, the best first-hand knowledge
of the group as a whole of any man in the United States or Canada.
And he was a world-recognized authority.” Another mycologist,
likewise world-known, states, “In his chosen field, the Gastero-
mycetes, Dr. Zeller was first among living authorities. The better-
known groups, like the puffballs and phalloids, have been admirably
treated a number of times. But the field studies which were made
possible by the riches of his own Northwest, and the painstaking
investigation of odd or imperfectly understood forms from else-
where, made his knowledge unique. In a day when most of us are
happy to be able to claim aquaintance merely with one or another
~aceae he was that rare and heartwarming phenomenon, a Good
Mycologist.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@In spite of his attainments in this field, the Gasteromycetes rep-
resented, of necessity, a side-issue professionally, for by appoint-
ment he was a plant pathologist and in constant touch with the need
for pathological research in the Northwest. During his twenty-
- nine years in Oregon, he assisted in solving many knotty problems
relating particularly to berry and tree-fruit production in the state.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Gilkey: Sanford Myron Zeller 359#Misc-exposition*]

[@A glance at the appended list of his publications will suffice to in-
dicate somewhat the variety of problems involved and the value, to
the fruit-growers and farmers, of his investigations. Strawberries
and cane-fruits, pomaceous and drupaceous tree-fruits, all came in
for their share of attention ; and Northwestern orchards are cleaner
and more profitable because of his work and that of his associates.
But his interest in pathology was not confined to crop plants. Any
leaf-spot or other indication of disease caught his eye, and required
of him an investigation into its life history. Note, for instance, such
items as: “New or noteworthy fungi on Ericaceous hosts in the
Pacific Northwest”; “An anthracnose of Ledum’’; “A witches’
broom of Ocean Spray.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@More than one hundred fifty scientific papers were prepared for
publication by Dr. Zeller, alone or in collaboration with other au-
thors, most of the subjects relating to fungi. Outstanding among
these are his contributions to a knowledge of the Gasteromycetes.
The following mathematical data are more than mere figures, for
into them can be read something of Dr. Zeller’s familiarity with the
fields in which he worked, his persistent and consistent application
to research in spite of difficulties, and his scientific curiosity which
gave him no rest. Independently he described three new orders,
nine families, six genera, eighty-one species ; and established twenty-
nine new names and combinations. Added to these are three new
genera, sixty-two species, and fifty-nine combinations published in
co-operation with other scientists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During his last year, he spent a four months’ sabbatical leave at
the New York Botanical Garden, preparing the comprehensive
treatment of the Gasteroinycetes which had been requested of him
for inclusion in the North American Flora, Fortunately he was
privileged to complete considerable of the manuscript, particularly
the very important keys whose publication has given to mycologists
one of his conspicuously important contributions to science.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hypogaei were perhaps his best love. Always in his car
he carried a short-handled rake, and he was rarely known to pass
a likely piece of woods without stopping to do a little tentative
grubbing. He was one of those rare collectors of these elusive
fungi who never came away empty-handed. The ability .to dis-
cover subterranean fungi involves principally three characteristics#Misc-exposition*]
[@360 MvcoLoctiA, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@—an understanding of their requirements, good judgment in apply-
ing this understanding, and luck. The order and proportions of
these three factors are not fixed, and many an unsuccessful grubber
would like to believe that the third is paramount. Whatever the
case, Dr. Zeller invariably brought home a handful or two of fruit-
ing bodies—not only of his own group but also, frequently, of those
hypogaeous ascomycetes, the Tuberales, generally much rarer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Concerrfing his collecting of subterranean fungi, Dr. Zeller al-
ways had a new good story on himself. On one occasion he, with
a party of other enthusiastic collectors (“groundhoggers” was the
official name), thoroughly worked over a mixed grove of conifers
and deciduous shrubbery. When they had finished, it must be
admitted that with the moss rolled back and the duff in large quan-
tities removed from beneath the trees, the woods looked consider-
ably worse for wear and certainly must have been perplexing to
any passing layman. Having occasion, in line with his duties as
pathologist, to visit fruit-growers in the vicinity sometime later, he
was startled to be informed of a recent cougar hunt organized by
the farmers of the community. His surprised exclamation brought
the reply, “Yes, sir, a few weeks ago we found the grove yonder all
clawed up, and nothing smaller than a cougar could have done it.
So we all went out for a day with our guns—but the critter’s still
at large.” When Dr, Zeller recounted the story and his friends
asked, superfluously, whether he had enlightened the farmers, his
deep chuckle was sufficient answer to the foolish question.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Zeller was a member of the American Mycological Society,
of which last fall he was elected vice-president; of the Phytopatho-
logical Society of whose Pacific Division he was president from 1922
to '24, and a member of its advisory board from 1925 to ’28. He
was associate editor of its official organ, Phytopathology, from 1924
to '30; was a member of Alpha Sigma Delta; and was elected to
honorary membership in Phi Sigma. On the Oregon State College
campus he served for a year as president of the local chapter of the#Misc-exposition*]

[@GILKEY: SANFORD MYRON ZELLER 361#Misc-exposition*]

[@Though his professional responsibilities and accomplishments
would appear to require a full-time schedule, he somehow found
time for other important activities. A member of the official board
of the local Methodist church, he helped carry through the con-
struction of the impressive present building of that denomination ;
and for twenty-two years he was chairman of the advisory com-
mittee of Wesley Foundation, which has done outstanding service
for college young people. Special honors were to have been ac-
corded him at the twenty-fifth anniversary of this student group,
but the date fell upon the day following his death.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With four daughters in the family, Dr. and Mrs. Zeller for years
were actively interested in Camp Fire; and were so largely re-
sponsible for the effective organization and smoothly-running ma-
chinery of the Corvallis Council that in 1948 they were each granted
the Luther Gulick award given volunteer workers for extraordinary
service.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Properly to appraise Dr. Zeller’s contributions to science and to
the community, one must know that stalking all his activities was
the illness which had followed him from childhood, had weakened
his otherwise powerfully-built frame, and from which he never was
completely free. He treated it casually; if he ever complained, no
one knew it. “Patient through suffering” is the thought which now
comes to his friends far more frequently than when he seemed
naturally to hold his place among individuals of normal health.
The sympathetic understanding and co-operation in his home and
the companionship of his friends were of fundamental value to him.
He will be missed as a scientist. Even more he will be missed by
those who knew the twinkle of his eye, his ever-ready story, his deep
infectious laugh, and the kindness of his heart.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A NEMATODE-CAPTURING FUNGUS WITH
ANASTOMOSING CLAMP-BEARING
HYPHAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHARLES DRECHSLER 1#Misc-exposition*]
[@(WITH 4 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Under the genus Nematoctonus I have described earlier five
nematode-destroying fungi whose hyphae are liberally beset with
clamp-connections of the kind long known as being characteristic
of some groups in the Basidiomycetes. Four of these fungi, namely
N. tylosporus (1), N. leiosporus (1), N. pachysporus (3), and
N. leptosporus (3), attack in a rather commonplace parasitic man-
ner by sending a germ tube into the animal host from an externally
adhering conidium. Necessarily the conidium in these parasites,
and, indeed, in the generality of fungous parasites subsisting on
free-living terricolous nematodes, must adhere very firmly, for
otherwise it would almost certainly be dislodged as the animal con-
tinues to move briskly through materials of close texture during
the period required for penetration of the integument and slow
transfer of spore contents into the invading hyphal tip. In N.
tylosporus and N. leptosporus the conidium secretes a minute mass
of glutinous material at its apex while it is still supported on its
sterigma. However in these two species, as also in N. leiosporus
and N. pachysporus, the adhesive organ most usually found oper-
ating effectively is formed after the spore has become detached,
the fallen conidium then regularly putting forth a short, erect or as-
cending outgrowth with a glandular tip, or terminal glandular cell,
that secretes a sizable globule of adhesive material. In N. hapto-
cladus (4), the fifth member of the genus to be named and de-
scribed, similar adhesive outgrowths or adhesive organs are formed#Misc-exposition*]

[@not only on fallen conidia, but also on the vegetative mycelium, usu-
ally being produced distally on prostrate hyphal branches as up-
curving terminations. Rather often, especially when the proximal
filamentous connection has been weakened through withdrawal of
protoplasmic contents, the specialized hyphal termination is torn
loose by a vigorous adhering eelworm, and then is carried away by
the doomed animal much like a fallen conidium with glutinous out-
growth. Yet often, again, the hyphal connection withstands the
struggles of the adhering eelworm, which consequently is held cap-
tive while undergoing invasion and, after death, expropriation of its
fleshy substance. In view of the predacious manner of attack thus
revealed, N. haptocladus offers an engaging parallelism with the few
nematode-capturing phycomycetous forms found among the Zo-
opagaceae, as well as with the considerably more numerous nema-
tode-capturing species that have been made known in the series of
clampless predacious hyphomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another species of Nematoctonus that attacks free-living ter-
ricolous eelworms both parasitically and predatorily came to light
more recently in several maizemeal-agar cultures, which, after be-
ing overgrown with uncontaminated mycelium of Pythium irregulare
Buism., had been further planted with pinches of decaying chess
(Bromus secalinus L.) detritus taken from a handful of this material
kindly gathered by Dr. W. J. Zaumeyer near Hermiston, Oregon, on
August 20,1947. The new Nematoctonus usually made its appear-
ance ten to fifteen days after the addition of the decaying residues
and in all instances obviously subsisted altogether on the many eel-
worms that soon had infested the cultures. Nearly all of the eel-
worms present belonged either to a somewhat robust species kindly
identified by Dr. G. Steiner as Panagrolaimus subelongatus Cobb,
or to a much more slender species determined as Ditylenchus sp.
The two types of nematodes were utilized by the fungus without
evident preference, though owing to its much greater abundance
P. subelongatus was destroyed in larger numbers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unlike Nematocionus haptocladus, which often is first observed
developing in agar plate cultures at some distance from the decay-
ing materials whence it originates, the Oregon fungus regularly
begins its visible development in tracts bordering the planted detri-
tus, and then spreads progressively into more remote areas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@FIG. 1. Nematoctonus concurrens.#Figure*]
[@372 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nevertheless its ramifying mycelium (rıc. 1, 4) greatly resembles
that of N. haptocladus in general aspect, the constituent hyphae
(r1G. 2,.4, a, b; B, a, b. F16.3, 4; J, a, b; K,a-c. FIG. 4, A; B,
a-c) being filled while in their youthful condition with protoplasm
of nearly homogeneous consistency. The longer filaments are little
given to abrupt changes either in width or in direction. All my-
celial elements except the shortest branches are studded with clamp-
connections. For the most part the clamps are spaced at distances
of 20 to 80µm, but here and there they are wont to occur in more
crowded arrangement with some intervals not exceeding 2. Ap-
parently no cross-walls other than those associated with clamp-con-
nections are formed to serve as ordinary partitions between adjacent
living undifferentiated vegetative hyphal segments. Hyphal fusions
(FIG. 1, A,a-c. FIG. 2,4,¢,d;B,c,d. x16. 3, 4, a; T, a; J, c;
K, d, e. FIG. 4, A, a—c; B, d), which have not been observed
either in N. haptocladus or in any of the four congeneric parasites,
occur here in sufficient numbers to be immediately noticed, though
scarcely with the frequency of anastomoses in the clampless nema-
tode-capturing hyphomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mycelium of the Oregon fungus, like that of Nematoctonus
haptocladus, is furnished with predacious organs consisting indi-
vidually of a globose adhesive body borne aloft 2 to 7 µm above the
substratum on a short stalk rising vertically from a prostrate hypha.
When examined microscopically from above, in their undisturbed
posture and without any addition of water, they appear as project-
ing knobs with a pitted or irregularly indented surface (FIG. 1, B, a,
b; FIG. 2, A, e-o; FIG. 4, A, d); their internal make-up and
underlying hyphal connections being then only indistinctly visible
or sometimes even wholly obscured. Viewed from the side in a dry
mount the hyphal connections stand out clearly, but the internal
make-up of the adhesive body still remains concealed (FIG. 1, C, a,
b). The composition of the predacious organ is seen better in ma-
terial that has been slightly moistened and with gentle pressure cov-
ered with a cover glass ; the adhesive body in material thus mounted
presenting a smoothly rounded profile, and revealing within it an
elongated cell conspicuously narrowed in the equatorial region some-
what after the manner of an hour-glass (FIG. 1, D, a-f. FIG. 2,
B, e-0; C,4,b; D, a, b; E,a-c; F, a-c; G, a-f; H, a; 1, a-c; J, a;#Misc-exposition*]

[@K,a; L,a-c; M,a. FIG. 3, A, b; B, a,b; C, a,b; D, a, b; E, a;
F,a;G,a, b; H,a, b; I, b, c; J, d-f; K, j-h. v1c. 4, B, e-h; C, a).
A very distinct line of demarcation always separates the distally
rounded protuberant stalk from the proximally rounded elongated
cell. Although an abrupt junction of two rounded lobes might in
itself be expected to offer much the appearance of a septum even
where no septum exists, close examination of many predacious or-
gans has inclined me strongly to the belief that a delimiting cross-
wall is really present here—this cross-wall, of course, being an or-
dinary one, not associated with a clamp-connection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Near its attachment to the stalk for a distance upward of about
1.5 p, the peripheral wall of the elongated cell seems slightly thick-
ened and has a somewhat dark indurated appearance. Beyond this
more substantial collar-like part the envelope is uniformly thin,
though yet of sufficient thickness to remain clearly visible through-
out; the fungus thereby differing from Nematoctonus haptocladus,
in which the membrane of the corresponding cell is so thin at the
rounded distal end as to be virtually indiscernible. It may be pre-
sumed that whereas in Nematoctonus haptocladus the glutinous
substance surrounding the cell is probably given out mainly from
the very thin-walled apical region, exudation in the Oregon fungus
may take place about equally from all portions of the membranous
envelope above the indurated collar-like part. The glandular cell
of the Oregon fungus is fully twice as long as that of N. haftocladus,
and, in general, about half again as wide. Its narrower shape is
accentuated in some degree by its more gradual and more extended
median constriction. Its greater volume and dimensions are re-
flected in correspondingly greater volume and dimensions of the
globule of adhesive material secreted by it; and its more elongate
form seems associated with a noticeably greater tendency toward
an elongated shape in the globule.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some protuberant stalks after producing a glandular cell in the
usual way will grow out laterally or obliquely at the tip and give rise
on a short prolongation to a second glandular cell (FIG. 3, J, g).
The process may be repeated again with the resulting development
of a third glandular cell (FIG. 2, H,). Such successive develop-
ment, like the similar development noted earlier in Nematoctonus
haptocladus as well as in N. pachysporus, is frequently preceded by#Misc-exposition*]

[@374#Misc-exposition*]











[@Fig. 2. Nematoctonus concurrens.#Figure*]
[@DRECHSLER: À NEMATODE-CAPTURING FUNGUS 375#Misc-exposition*]

[@degeneration in the older glandular cells—this degeneration be-
coming manifest usually in withdrawal of protoplasmic contents
from the distal lobe (FIG. 3, J, h), together sometimes with disap-
pearance of the enveloping mass of adhesive material (FIG. 2, J, d).
In instances where the distal lobe is found empty while the proximal
lobe is still filled with protoplasm, the retaining wall present in the
constriction consists of an ordinary partition not associated with a
clamp-connection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the very short erect stalks supporting the glandular cells al-
ways arise from prostrate hyphae, never being borne on submerged
or ascending mycelial filaments, the Oregon fungus, much like
Nematoctonus pachysporus, is capable of capturing only nematodes
moving on the surface of a culture. In its usually forward move-
ment, the animal commonly strikes the raised adhesive globule with
the anterior portion of its body, often, indeed, being found held di-
rectly by its head (FIG. 2,J,a. x16. 3, Z, b, c; J, i; K, i. Fig. 4,
B, i; D-G: a; H, a); though attachment to adhesive organs also
takes place farther backward (FIG. 4, B, j, k). Adhesion to a
single predacious organ suffices, as a rule, for the capture of robust
specimens of either Panagrolaimus subelongatus or Ditylenchus sp.
After the struggles of the captive have diminished in violence, pre-
sumably from exhaustion, the glandular cell puts forth a narrow
process which perforates the animal’s integument, then immediately
widens out and begins growing through the fleshy interior as an
assimilative hypha (FIG. 3, H, c; FIG. 4,.D, a). In many instances
the assimilative hypha soon gives off a branch close to its origin
(FIG. 2, J, a; FIG. 4, H, a), but often, again, it may attain a length of
approximately 100 µm while remaining in a simple condition (rra. 3,
I,b,c; J,i. rıc. 4, E-G: a). Branching in assimilative hyphae
frequently is accompanied, or perhaps rather closely followed, by
the formation of clamp-connections (FIG. 2, K, b; FIG. 3, K, 1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although a single predacious organ usually is altogether effective
in holding fast a moderately robust eelworm, the struggling animal
often brushes against other predacious organs, and thus becomes
affixed in two (FIG. 3, H, b, c; I, b, c), three (FIG. 4, B, i-k), or
more places. Since here, as in nematode-capturing fungi generally,
each predacious organ operates rather independently of others, cap-
tives often incur multiple invasion by reason only of their multiple#Misc-exposition*]
[@376 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@affixture (FIG. 3,1, b,c). In the Oregon fungus multiple infection
further comes about very frequently through the curious develop-
ment of accessory infective branches (FIG. 2, K, c-e; L, e-g. FIG.
3,1, d; J, j-l; K, j-m. 919. 4, B, Lom; C, c; D-G: b, e; H, c).
These branches arise usually at distances of 10 to 50 from a pre-
dacious organ that has newly captured a nematode. Very of-
ten they are put forth from the same hypha that bears the pre-
dacious organ (FIG. 2, K, c, d; L, e-g. FIG. 3,J,l. Fig. 4, B, l;
C, c; D, b, c), but with about equal frequency they originate from
neighboring hyphae, which in some instances have an observable
connection with the predacious organ either from the ramification
of the mycelium (FIG. 2, K, ¢) or from anastomosis of mycelial fila-
ments (FIG. 3, K, j-m), but in other instances lack such connection
(FIG. 3, J, j, ks FIG. 4, B, m). Often the growth of the accessory
branches is from the beginning rather accurately directed toward
the position where the struggling animal is held fast by the fungus
(FIG. 3, J, 1; FIG. 4, D, b), though often, again, their courses seem
rather haphazard or even circuitous (FIG. 4, B, 7; D,c). Despite
some aberration they converge unmistakably as they elongate (FIG.
4, E, b, c), and after about an hour or perhaps two hours of growth
they reach their goal, each bringing its tip against the animal's in-
tegument in immediate proximity to the adhering predacious organ
(FIG. 4, B, l, m; F, b, c). On penetrating the integument the indi-
vidual branch intrudes a prolongation which then extends itself
autonomously through the fleshy interior as an assimilative hypha
(FIG. 4, C, c; F, b; G, b) in fellowship with the assimilative hypha
arising from the predacious organ.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although in most cases the number of accessory infective branches
associated with a predacious organ ranges from one to five, develop-
ment of such branches in numbers from six to ten occurs rather
often, and instances of development in numbers from eleven to
fifteen come under observation at least occasionally. The con-
vergence of multiple branches makes for an appearance strongly
reminiscent of sexual reproductive apparatus in species of oomy-
cetes where the oogonium is fertilized by plural antheridia. No
development of accessory infective branches was recorded in my
account of Nematoctonus haptocladus or in the descriptions of the
four congeneric species, though until further observations are made#Misc-exposition*]
[@- Drecuster: A NEMATODE-cAPTURING Funcus 377#Misc-exposition*]

[@the possibility is not to be dismissed that among these closely re-
lated forms similar development might occur on so small a scale
as readily to escape detection. The accessory infective branches
produced by the Oregon fungus offer some little resemblance to the
supplementary connections formed in some clampless nematode-
capturing hyphomycete species—my Dactylella doedycoides and my
D. heterospora (2: 341—342) may be cited as examples—where the
stalk supporting the predacious organ lacks sturdiness, owing mainly
to its length, and consequently often suffers injury from the strug-
gles of the prey. These supplementary connections, however, are
commonly produced only singly and, as a rule, are intercalated be-
tween two fungus cells external to the animal. Unlike the acces-
sory infective branches, they generally neither penetrate the animal's
integument anew nor intrude an additional assimilative hyphal sys-
tem; their function evidently being only to supply better communi-
cation between the external mycelium and the assimilative hyphae
intruded by the predacious organ.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since in most instances a captured specimen of Panagrolaimus
subelongatus adheres to the predacious organ by its head, invasion
of its body proceeds commonly from the head (Fig. 2, J-L; Fig. 3,
I-K; Fig. 4, D-G, H) toward the tail. The angular relationships
of the ramified mycelium in the posterior portion of a dead captive
(FIG. 3, L; FIG. 4, I, J) suggest strongly that hyphal fusions must
occur rather frequently among assimilative filaments, even though
it is true that an appearance of hyphal fusion is often simulated
here through the circumstance that many branches are extended in
a direction opposite to the direction of growth of the parent
filament. As a rule the protoplasm elaborated by the fungus
from the contents of a relatively small eelworm is transferred
to the external mycelium entirely through the adhesive organ
and accessory infective branches. This is often true also where
larger animals are concerned, if many accessory infective branches
are present. However, in many instances where the eelworm
is of large size and only a few accessory infective branches
are present, a portion of the elaborated protoplasm is used
in extending several hyphae—often about five or six—out from
the posterior (FIG. 3, L, a, b; FIG. 4, J) and median portions
of the animal. Obviously these erumpent hyphae belong with the#Misc-exposition*]

[@external mycelium, and therefore, after some elongation and branch-
ing, may put forth predacious organs and conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In contrast to Nematoctonus haptocladus, which produces conidia
only rather sparingly, the Oregon fungus usually shows abundant
sporulation. Its prostrate mycelium gives rise to conidia hap-
hazardly (FIG. 1, A, d-k), the longer procumbent hyphae often
bearing them (FIG. 1, D, g-i; FIG. 2, A, p; L, h-j) interspersed
among predacious organs. They originate as. terminal swellings
on tapering sterigmata (FIG. 1, E, F) and increase in size with con-
tinued accession of protoplasm from below (FIG. 1, A, d; G-J) un-
til they become delimited from the slender supporting tip by a sep-
tum (FIG. 1, K, L; FIG. 4, K). On the ascending hyphae, which
regularly are devoid of predacious organs, conidia are produced
in the beginning at rather wide intervals (FIG. 1, M, a-c; FIG. 3, M,
a, b), but seemingly more conidia are later put forth from inter-
calary positions, to provide eventually a bristling display (Fig. 4, L,
M). Prostrate (FIG. 3, K, b, c) as well as aerial (FIG. 4, N-P)
hyphae on which conidia have been produced at close intervals
show in their denuded condition a conspicuously close arrangement
also of clamp-connections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although slightly plumper and appreciably larger, the mature de-
tached conidia of the Oregon fungus (FIG. 1, N, a-2; O, aj. FIG.
3, N-P: a-z. FIG. 4, Q, a-g) most nearly resemble, among con-
generic forms, those of Nematoctonus haptocladus with respect to
size and shape. In my cultures they’ germinated less freely than
the conidia of N. haptocladus, but their germinative development
followed essentially the same course. The fallen spore would first
send up a short erect outgrowth from a position usually near one
of its ends, as simultaneously several clustered vacuoles came into
view toward its other end (FIG. 1, Q, a). On the rounded tip of
the spur-like outgrowth a glandular cell, noticeably smaller but
otherwise similar to glandular cells of mycelial origin, was then
produced while the farther end of the spore was emptied of proto-
plasmic contents with concomitant formation of one (FIG. 1, Q, b-d)
or two (FIG. 1, Q, e-t) retaining walls. In one observed instance
(FIG. 1, Q, 7) the spore envelope was almost wholly emptied from
production of a single glandular cell at the tip of a germinative out-
growth over 30 µm long—this being fully six times the usual length#Misc-exposition*]
[@380 Mycouoera, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@of the erect support. Ordinarily, however, about one-half to three-
fifths of the protoplasm was left over, so that the conidium through
further withdrawal of contents (FIG. 1, Q, &) and deposition fre-
quently of a third retaining wall (rc. 1, Q, I) was capable of giving
rise to a second glandular cell on a short prolongation of the ger-
minative outgrowth. Occasionally a conidium that had produced a
second glandular cell on an outgrowth arising from a median posi-
tion showed an empty segment at each end (FIG.1,Q,m). Follow-
ing the degeneration of the first two glandular cells produced by
them some conidia extended their outgrowth again to form a third
glandular cell (FIG. 1, Q, ), thereby emptying a fourth segment
though yet retaining about one-fifth of their original protoplasmic
contents—enough, presumably, to have made possible the formation
later of a fourth glandular cell.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Each glandular cell produced on a germinative outgrowth soon
secretes an enveloping globule of adhesive material which serves,
whenever opportunity offers, to attach the conidium to some roving
eelworm (FIG. 4, H, b). An animal that has been thus encumbered
may continue to move about until it is disabled from progressive in-
vasion by an assimilative hypha intruded by the adhering spore, but
rather often before such disablement supervenes it encounters a
predacious organ and is held fast (FIG. 4, H, a). In the latter
event the glandular cell produced by the conidium may evoke de-
velopment of accessory infective branches (Fig. 4, H, c) after the
same manner as glandular cells of mycelial origin. As the very
numerous conidia in my cultures gave rise to adhesive outgrowths
only sparingly, the Oregon fungus displayed little of the strong ca- '
pabilities for parasitic attack it assuredly should unfold under con-
ditions favorable for germination of its spores. Owing to the en-
duringly sturdy attachment of its predacious organs, including
those borne on lateral branches (FIG. 2, M, a; FIG. 3, F, a; G, a, b),
it affords little scope for the simulation of parasitic attack usual in
Nematoctonus haptocladus, where the attachment of predacious or-
gans often becomes weakened early through evacuation of the prox-
imal segments of the branches on which they are borne.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Occasionally a fallen conidium is found united to a neighboring
mycelial filament by means of a short hyphal connection (FIG. 1, P).
Manifestly such a fusion is of the same character as the hyphal#Misc-exposition*]

[@anastomoses so frequent in the fungus, and like these offers paral-
lelism with the clampless nematode-capturing hyphomycetes. Since
hyphal fusions serve to join numerous small mycelia into more ex-
tensive three-dimensional tracts, and in some basidiomycetes bring
about nuclear relationships necessary for sexual development, the
Oregon fungus would seem, perhaps somewhat more likely than
the several congeneric forms previously described, to yield a basidial
stage visible to the naked eye. In my cultures, however, no basid-
ial stage ever came to light, nor was any reproductive apparatus
ever found produced by the fungus apart from the conidial ap-
paratus herein discussed. The fungus is therefore described in the
genus Nematoctonus, and under a specific epithet having reference
to the convergence of its accessory infective branches.#Misc-exposition*]

ability of actinomycetes is well known and streptomycin producing
cultures are no exceptions. Schatz and Waksman (8) have al-
ready called our attention to the variability of Streptomyces griseus.
Carvajal (2), in addition, has isolated numerous strains of this or-
ganism from nature. The above authors mentioned streptomycin
production as one of the characters in which variation was noted.
Moreover, Stanley (9) has successfully used strain selection to in-
crease yields of streptomycin. By use of ultraviolet light treat-
ment of spores and single colony isolation, he was able to obtain
strains which produced striking yields when compared to the parent
culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original culture of S treptomyces griseus used in this work
was received from Waksman’s laboratory. Stock cultures were
prepared by adding spores to sterile soil. As cultures were
needed, spores were transferred from these soil stocks to Blake
bottle slants of yeast extract-glucose agar. After good sporulation
was obtained, sterile distilled water was added to the bottle and
loose spores were washed free. This spore suspension was de-
canted into a sterile flask, shaken vigorously for several minutes
and then filtered through several layers of sterile absorbent cotton.
The effect of ultraviolet light was determined by exposing a por-
tion of this spore suspension to ultraviolet light at a wave length of
2,537 A for varying intervals of time. As a rule the time interval
employed was sufficient to allow killing of more than 99 per cent
of the spores. Treatment with (CICH,CH,),N was achieved by
mixing another portion of the spore suspension in phosphate buf-
fer at pH 8.0 with the (CICH,CH,),N at a final concentration of
0.005 µM. After the desired treatment, the spores were diluted in
a solution of 1 per cent glycine in distilled water. Natural vari-
ation was investigated by plating out diluted suspensions of un-
treated spores. In all of the above instances, surviving spores were
plated out on yeast extract-glucose agar. The colonies that de-
veloped were transferred to slants of the same medium and allowed
to sporulate. Spores from these cultures were used to inoculate
the fermentation medium. This medium consisted of soy bean
meal 20.0 gr., dextrose 10.0 gr., sodium chloride 10.0 gr., and dis-
tilled water 1 liter. The pH was adjusted to between 7.0 and 7.2
with 1 N sodium hydroxide before sterilization. The medium was
dispensed in 40 ml. amounts in 125 ml. Erlenmeyer flasks, plugged
with non-absorbent cotton and autoclaved at 121° C. for 20 min-
utes. After cooling, the flasks were inoculated and placed on a
rotary-type shaker moving at a rate of 220 rpm. so that each flask
described a circle 1.5 inches in diameter. The flasks were incu-
bated at 28° C.#Misc-exposition*]

chloride as the standard, was used for assay throughout the in-
vestigations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological variation. The amount of morphological vari-
ation depends upon the strain under observation. Some strains
are morphologically quite stable, while others show a tremendous
range of variation. Estimating the variation induced in these
unstable strains as a result of treatment with ultraviolet light or
(CICH,CH,),N is understandably difficult. It is quite obvious,
however, that treatment of spores with both of these agents results
in severe morphological change. Variants, that have not as yet
been obtained from untreated spores, can be obtained after treat-
ment. In addition, the incidence of the variants that are obtained
without any treatment is increased by the above treatments. One
of the most variable characters is the degree of sporulation. Cul-
tures range from the parental type to types which form no spores at
all. Not only the amount of sporulation but spore color is vari-
able. The color range is from gray-green through light buff to
pure white. This variation in amount of sporulation and in color
of spores results in a marked variation in the colony appearance.
Further changes can be seen in the margin and surface of the col-
ony as well as in colony sectoring. The amount of exudate on the
colony surface, as well as the amount and color of the soluble pig-
ment released into the medium, varies among mutants. Changes in
the amount and color of the pigment produced are often striking.
The usual range in pigmentation is from none through a light yel-
low to a deep brown to black. Frequently, however, mutants are
obtained which produce a diffusible pale pink to deep pink pigment.
These observations were made with cultures growing on yeast ex-
tract-glucose agar. Media probably could be devised which would
show these pigment changes to greater advantage.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examples of ultraviolet light induced mutants are shown in
figure 1.*#Misc-exposition*]

[@Attempts have been made to correlate productive capacity with
morphological type. Detailed observations of a large number of
mutants have shown some correlation but in no case is this corre-
lation complete. One strain studied in detail was a near-albino#Misc-exposition*]

[@392 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@sporulating mutant which was quite stable morphologically. Study
of more than 1,000 isolates from this culture resulted in one strik-
ing correlation between production and morphology. A number of
cultures showed a ragged appearance with reduced sporulation and
development of phage-like plaques. These cultures were signifi-
cantly better than the parent, the correlation between production
and morphological appearance being almost perfect.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another strain studied in detail was a gray-green sporulating
type. This was the most unstable culture that has thus far been
examined. Two general types were isolated from it. One was
the normal gray-green sporulating type which exhibited little vari-
ability in morphology or capacity for producing streptomycin.
The other type could be conveniently termed albino, though it was
certainly a heterogeneous mixture of albino types. Production by
isolates of this latter group ranged from nothing to very high values.
There was within this albino group no correlation between morpho-
logical type and streptomycin production. While it may be noted
that all promising cultures isolated from this strain were of the
albino type, it was likewise true that all isolates incapable of produc-
ing streptomycin were of the same type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results, then, would indicate that detailed investigation of one
strain may reveal some correlation between productive capacity and
morphological type. Such a correlation, however, will probably not
hold true for a different strain. Thus far, no definite correlation be-
tween morphological character and productive capacity has been
found. Although such a correlation may seem to exist if a relatively
small number of isolates are investigated, it disappears if a detailed
examination of large numbers of cultures is made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Schatz and Waksman (8) have reported the isolation of cultures
which produced no aerial mycelium and no streptomycin. From
these cultures sporulating isolates were obtained which again
produced streptomycin. Such cultures have been isolated in this
and, undoubtedly, in other laboratories. Not all of these non-sporu-
lating cultures, however, lack the ability to produce streptomycin.
Some are capable of producing relatively high yields. In table I is
shown the productivity of seven non-sporulating single colony iso-
lates selected at random from a sporulating streptomycin producing
strain.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Dulaney, Ruger, Hlavac: Streptomyces Grisevs. IV 393#Misc-exposition*]

[@Structurally these non-sporulating strains are probably com-
posed of the substratum mycelium of Orskov (6) or the primary
mycelium of Klieneberger-Nobel (5). The lack of aerial or sec-
ondary mycelium may be due to the failure of the "initial cells,"
discussed by Klieneberger-Nobel (5), to organize.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Non-streptomycin producing strains. Sporulating strains, as well
as non-sporulating strains, can be isolated which lack the ability to
produce streptomycin. The incidence of these zero strains can be
increased by treatment with ultraviolet light.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It was thought possible that the failure of these strains to produce
streptomycin was due to their inability to synthesize various por-
tions of the streptomycin molecule. If this were true it might be
possible to obtain streptomycin production from these cultures by
inoculating fermentation medium with spore mixtures of zero mu-
tants which produced complementary portions of the streptomycin
molecule. In addition, if the unsynthesized portion(s) of the strep-
tomycin molecule was (were) supplied, single cultures might again
produce streptomycin. These suppositions are predicated by the
ability of the organism to unite the various portions of the molecule,
when they are present, even though the portions under consideration
might not be synthesized first and then united in the regular course
of biosynthesis. However, when medium was inoculated with
spore mixtures of these zero strains, no streptomycin was formed.
In addition, when various parts of the streptomycin molecule were
added singly and in combination to media inoculated with zero
strains, negative results were again obtained.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should be noted, however, that this work was done with only
a few strains. The physiology of these strains would be similar if
the formation of streptomycin were interrupted in each case by a
mutation at the same gene position. In this event, similar interme-
diates would accumulate and the strains would react similarly to the
addition of possible streptomycin precursors. In addition, if a
fermentation medium is inoculated with a mixture of such cul-
tures the negative results noted above are to be expected. In-
vestigation of a group of cultures, in which the ability to synthesize
streptomycin has been interrupted by mutations at different gene
positions, may aid in isolating streptomycin intermediates and thus
serve to determine the mechanism of biosynthesis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Strains with increased productive capacity. One of the reasons
for undertaking a study of normal and induced variation in Strep-
tomyces griseus was to determine if strains could be selected which
possessed an increased capacity for streptomycin production. The
results, in part, are summarized in figure 2. The broth potency
produced by strain A is taken as unity and the productivity of se-
lected strains is compared to strain A.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores from strain A were treated with ultraviolet light, and cul-
tures which developed from the surviving spores were tested for
streptomycin production. One of these cultures, B, produced 60
per cent more streptomycin than strain A, or 1.6 times as much.
Spores from strain B were likewise treated with ultraviolet light.
Two cultures thus obtained, C and D, produced approximately 12.5
per cent more streptomycin than the parent strain B, or 1.8 times
as much as strain A. Although these yields are not striking, as com-
pared with those obtained from the parent culture B, they repre-
sent a significant increase and are reproducible over a large number
of retests. Spores of strain B were also treated with (CICH,-
CH,),N. Two cultures, E and F, which produced 25 per cent and
37.5 per cent more streptomycin than strain B, were so obtained.
These strains produce 2.0 and 2.2 times as much streptomycin as
strain A. These cultures, however, rapidly lost the ability to
produce streptomycin, thus making further work with them im-
practical. The most promising culture isolated from strain B was
strain G. This strain was obtained as a single colony isolate by
plating untreated spores of strain B on yeast extract-glucose agar.
It is morphologically similar to its parent and consistently produces
streptomycin yields 37.5 per cent higher than the yields produced by
the parent strain B, or broth potencies 2.2 times as high as are
produced by strain A. Spores of strain G were treated with ultra-
violet light, the survivors allowed to develop on yeast extract-glu-
cose agar, and the resulting colonies isolated and tested. From ap-
proximately 150 isolates thus tested, three cultures were obtained
which produced approximately 45.5 per cent more streptomycin
than strain G. These cultures, H, I, and J, produce 3.2 times as
much streptomycin as the original strain A.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Further mutation and selection of the highest producing strains
has been carried out. The above results, however, are sufficient#Misc-exposition*]
[@396 Mycologia, Vow. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@to show how induced mutation and strain selection can be used to
increase streptomycin production. When one is undertaking such
selection, however, it must be understood that the cultures are be-
ing tested for production under the set of conditions being used.
Cultures thus found to produce high yields should not necessarily be
expected to produce corresponding yields with changed conditions.
Changes in the fermentation environment may have varying effects
on different strains. Medium specific mutants should be ex-
pected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It would be very enlightening if the physiological changes re-
sulting in increased streptomycin productivity could be determined.
With this in mind, some investigations of the physiology of various
mutants have been made. Although some physiological differences
between various mutants have been found, nothing indicates why
one strain is capable of producing more streptomycin than the other.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The improved broth potencies noted above are not confined to
experiments made on media composed partially of complex plant
and animal material. Relatively high yields have been obtained on
well defined simple synthetic media (3) (4).#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE
PAPILLATION OF OOGONIA OF
ACHLYA COLORATA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Helen Simpson Reischer#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 6 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Achlya colorata can be clearly distinguished from its closest
relative, Achlya racemosa, by the difference in the diameters of
their oospores as well as by differences in such minor features as
relative abundance of gemmae. However, the specific status of 4.
colorata was long debated because of the irregularity of the appear-
ance of the papillate oogonia which were regarded by early in-
vestigators as the most important specific characteristic of this
fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A. colorata was first described by Cornu (1872) as A. racemosa
var. stelligera and A. racemosa var. spinosa. Pringsheim (1882)
renamed these varieties 44. colorata, primarily on the basis of
oogonial papillation. Fischer (1892), finding smooth and papil-
late oogonia on the same hyphae, considered 4. colorata to be the
same as A. racemosa. Minden (1912) continued to follow Cornu,
describing in addition a form, Pringsheimii, of A. racemosa with “a
few projections which may give the oogonia an angular appear-
ance" and slightly fewer oospores. It remained for Coker (1923)
to point out that "It is true that smooth or nearly smooth oogonia
may appear rarely in this species, but they are not the oogonia of
A. racemosa, which are always easily recognized by their much
smaller eggs." The oospores of 4. racemosa are mostly about 22 µm
in diameter, those of A. colorata mostly 30-37 µm. Coker also
states that "We have never seen a perfectly smooth oogonium in
A. colorata or a papillate one in A. racemosa.” This has not been
true of our cultures of A. colorata.#Misc-exposition*]

ture affects not only quantitative, but also qualitative characteristics#Misc-exposition*]

[@REISCHER: PAPILLATION OF OOGONIA 399#Misc-exposition*]

[@of living organisms, that mycologists working with the Saprolegnia-
ceae, and with many other groups of fungi, have in the past paid so
little attention to the temperatures at which the cultures they have
described were grown. The effect of temperature on papillation in
this fungus came to my attention more or less accidentally: a
mycelial mat (derived from a single-spore culture which had been
previously identified as A. colorata when grown on hemp seed at
15° C.) grown in pure culture at 25° C. produced apparently smooth
oogonia. This culture was then incubated at 15° C. for two days,
during which period papillate oogonia appeared.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to determine more precisely the effect of temperature on
papillation in A. colorata, cultures were grown, on several media, at
temperatures ranging from 10 to 30° C. at 5° intervals. No growth
occurred at 30° C. on any of the media used. Three single-spore
isolates of A. colorata, from a collection of soil, made in Palisades
Interstate Park, N. J., were used in these experiments: in the later
experiments a culture derived from a single hyphal tip from an iso-
late obtained from Dr. Shanor was also employed as inoculum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unifungal cultures on boiled halves of popcorn and hemp seed
in petri dishes containing charcoal-treated distilled water gave some-
what equivocal results. On both of these substrates oogonia were
invariably papillate at 10 and 15° C., though papillation was rather
more regular at the higher temperature. The first oogonial initials
appeared in five to six days at 10° C., three days at 15° C. Oogonia
appeared in two days in cultures incubated at 20° C., but when the
cultures were examined on the fifth day a minority of the oogonia
were atypical, with fewer, shorter papillae than at 15° C., or rarely
with the surface of the oogonium merely uneven. This tendency
toward the suppression of papillae was marked in cultures grown
at 25? C., though even here only approximately half of the oogonia,
mainly those nearer the substrate, showed atypical characteristics
ranging from possession of only one or two papillae to complete
smoothness of the oogonial surface.#Misc-exposition*]

such as food and oxygen and bacterial contamination (which sooner
or later always became evident in the unifungal cultures) —4.

[@been added was used as the solid medium. Cultures grown on this
agar in petri dishes gave the following results: At 10 and 15° C.
papillate oogonia appeared in eight and four days respectively. At
20° C. the oogonia, appearing from the second day of growth, were
usually roughened or with a few short papillae, infrequently reach-
ing the extremes of normal papillation (as described for the species)
or of complete smoothness of surface. At 25° C. the oogonia
formed were roughened or completely smooth, never papillate,
aborting or producing oospores which were nearly all aborted by
the eighth day of growth. The position of the oogonia in the agar
or on the surface of the agar did not obviously affect papillation.
The liquid medium employed consisted of 5 g./l. of yellow corn
meal (as an extract made by boiling with distilled water 77 hour
and centrifuged clear before use), 1 g./l. of yeast extract and 5 or
2.5 g./l. of glucose. There was no difference in papillation associ-
ated with the difference in concentration of glucose. A. colorata
was grown in 20 ml. portions of this broth in 250 ml. Erlenmeyer
flasks until the appearance of the first oogonial initials (at 7-10,
5, 3 and 3 days for cultures incubated at 10, 15, 20 and 25° C.
respectively), when the mats were transferred, without washing, to
sterile charcoal-treated distilled water in petri dishes. The mats
matured more normally, though papillation was not markedly af-
fected, when treated in this way than when allowed to remain in the
culture broth. It was found that sexual reproduction was inhib-
ited by washing the mycelia. Results were as follows: Oogonia
were never formed in abundance at 10° C. and those formed were
somewhat atypical and aborted. At 15° C. papillate oogonia were
produced. An oogonium typical both of the cultures grown at
15° C. and of the species as described is shown in figure 1. The
papillae, 6-10 µm long, are set regularly about the entire surface of
the oogonium. The number of papillae may be slightly fewer than
in this figure or sometimes greater, with occasional papillae touch-
ing at their bases or fused along their sides. The oogonia, irregu-
larly set with short papillae, or merely roughened, shown in figures
2, 3 and 4, are typical of about 90 per cent of those appearing at 20°
C. Oogonia typical of about the same percentage of those produced
at 25° C, are shown in figures 5 and 6 as roughened or with 1 or#Misc-exposition*]

[@2 short papillae. None was as papillate as any of the oogonia pro-
duced in the 15° C. cultures. A completely smooth oogonium was
rarely seen. The oospores almost invariably aborted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems likely that the differences of opinion regarding papil-
lation of the oogonia of A. colorata have been caused by differences
in temperature in the laboratories in which this fungus has been
studied. Pure cultures, grown under described conditions, should
be used for the description of species. The use of mixed or even of
unifungal cultures may have contributed to the confused status of
many species of the Saprolegniaceae and should be discouraged.#Misc-exposition*]

[@AMINO ACIDS IN THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF
PENICILLIN#Misc-exposition*]

[@Freperick T. Wour#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several investigations have been concerned with amino acids as
sources of nitrogen for the production of penicillin. Foster et al.
(1943) were apparently the first to test individual amino acids as
sole sources of nitrogen for penicillin production by Penicillium nota-
tum in surface cultures, finding that nitrate nitrogen was superior to
amino acids. In subsequent experiments with submerged cultures,
these workers (1946) noted that glutamic acid was superior to as-
paragine or glycine as a nitrogen source for one mold strain tested.
With another strain, however, various single amino acids did not
promote penicillin formation in the basal medium, either with or
without additional sources of nitrogen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Large increases in penicillin yield obtained in media containing
corn steep liquor were found by White et al. (1945) to be at least
partially due to arginine, histidine and glutamic acid. When a mix-
ture of these compounds, in concentrations of 30 mg., 30 mg., and
400 mg. per 100 mL, respectively, was added to a basal medium
containing glucose, lactose and mineral salts, yields assaying 80-90
per cent of that obtained in corn steep media resulted. This find-
ing suggested that amino acids might be involved in the biosynthe-
sis of penicillin: “It would appear that in some way this mold is
perhaps able to convert one or several of the amino acids to a part
of the penicillin molecule through its metabolic processes.” It was
further shown that hydrolyzed corn steep liquor is unsatisfactory
for penicillin production, in comparison with hydrolyzed protein-
free liquor, the large increase in free amino acids resulting in con-
ditions unfavorable for penicillin formation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Halpern et al. (1945) reported increased penicillin production
upon the addition of proline or glutamic acid to synthetic media.
Aspartic acid could be substituted for glutamic acid, and the addi-
tion of arginine also had a slight stimulatory effect. A number of#Misc-exposition*]

[@404 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@other amino acids, however, including histidine, methionine, trypto-
phane, hydroxyproline and phenylalanine, were ineffective.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stone and Farrell (1946) failed to obtain consistent increases
in penicillin yield upon the addition of most of the common amino
acids to synthetic media, although occasional increases sometimes
followed the addition of leucine, cystine or cysteine. Cook and
Brown (1946) recorded increased yields upon the simultaneous
addition of glucose and leucine or glucose and tyrosine, although the
‚addition of the amino acids alone gave only a slight stimulatory
effect.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a subsequent paper (1947) these same workers studied more
thoroughly the influence upon penicillin yield in surface cultures of
the addition of various amino acids to a basal medium containing
NaNO,. The amino acids were added in such quantities as to
provide a nitrogen content (exclusive of NaNO,) of 140 mg. per
cent. Under these conditions, small increases in penicillin yield
were obtained with dl-tyrosine, serine, cystine, dl-aspartic acid,
glutamic acid, arginine, histidine, dJ-tryptophane, proline and as-
paragine. Glycine, alanine, valine, d-isoleucine, phenylalanine,
i-diftydroxyphenylalanine, methionine or di-lysine, however, had no

presence of phenylacetic acid, and in the presence of di-penicil-

[@Cardinal and Hedrick (1948) have recently presented analyses
of the amino acid content of corn steep liquor. A corn steep liquor
hydrolysate was found by microbiological assay to contain alanine
in excess of 27 per cent of the nitrogen present, large amounts of
arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine, proline, lysine, valine,
threonine and isoleucine, as well as smaller quantities of phenyl-
alanine, aspartic acid, cystine, methionine and tyrosine.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study was undertaken because of the diversity of

[@biosynthesis of penicillin, resulting in part from the use of differ-
ent mold strains and a variety of basal media by various workers.
Further, no data of this type are available concerning Penicillium
chrysogenum Q-176, the strain employed in almost all commercial
penicillin production at the present time.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@P. chrysogenum Q-176 was employed in the present experiments.
Stock cultures were maintained on slants of Czapek’s agar. The
basal medium for submerged cultures was adapted from one devel-
oped by Moyer and Coghill (1946) and has the following com-
position : lactose monohydrate, 27.5 g.; glucose monohydrate, 3.0 g.;
MgSO, °7H,0O, 0.25 g.; KH,PO,, 0.50 g.; ZnSO,-7H,O, 0.044 g.;
and MnSO,-4H,O, 0.020 g. per liter. To this basal medium were
added various amino acids as sole sources of nitrogen, in quantities
sufficient to provide a nitrogen concentration of 50 mg. per cent.
Controls were provided in which the nitrogen was supplied as
NaNO, (50 mg. per cent of nitrogen) or as corn steep solids (22.0
g. per liter). No phenylacetic acid or other penicillin precursor
was added to the media; hence the penicillin produced, except in
the series containing corn steep solids, was probably largely peni-
cillin K (Higuchi et al., 1946).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultures were grown at room temperature, in Erlenmeyer
flasks of 500 ml. capacity containing 100 ml. of medium. The cul-
tures were continuously agitated by means of a reciprocating
shaker operating at the rate of 100 strokes per minute, with a
stroke length of 7.0 cm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All penicillin assays were performed on filtrates of cultures 7
days of age. The assay for total penicillins was carried out by
means of the dilution technique, using Staphylococcus aureus H as
the test organism. The broth from the Penicillium cultures was re-
moved under sterile conditions, dilutions of 1:5, 1:25, 1: 125, 1:625
and 1: 3125 were made in tubes of Difco Heart Infusion Broth, and
each tube was inoculated with 0.1 ml. of a 24 hr. culture of S. aureus.
The tubes were incubated at 37° C. and read after 18 hrs. After
determination of the highest dilution inhibiting growth and the low-
est dilution with apparent turbidity, an aliquot of the penicillin
broth, which had been stored in a refrigerator, was reassayed.#Misc-exposition*]
[@406 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the reassay, another series of five tubes was prepared, includ-
ing the concentrations of penicillin immediately above and below
the end point of the preliminary assay, with three intermediate
concentrations interpolated. The highest dilutions inhibitory to
growth of S. aureus are included in table I.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sensitivity of S. aureus H, using commercial penicillin G
as a standard, was determined to be 0.030 units/ml. This value was
checked repeatedly during the course of the experiments, and, as
no variation was found, it was employed in the conversion of di-
lution units to Oxford units.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Only a trace of growth was obtained in media containing cystine.
Microscopic examination showed that spore germination occurred,
but mycelial growth was very restricted. This observation is in
agreement with the finding (Wolf, 1948) that cystine is not oxi-
dized by this strain of P. chrysogenum. Cysteine monohydro-
chloride was evidently toxic in the concentration employed, as ger-
mination was completely inhibited.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although no quantitative determinations of the amount of my-
celial growth were made, it was apparent that proline and glutamic
acid are particularly favorable for growth of P. chrysogenum.
Alanine, which was previously shown (Wolf, 1948) to be respired
at a very rapid rate by this strain, did not support as luxuriant
mycelial growth as did proline or glutamic acid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In table I are included the various amino acids tested, the quan-
tity of each which was used (equivalent to 50 mg. per cent of
nitrogen) and the results of penicillin assays from 2—4 experiments

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In explanation of the apparently low yields obtained in cultures
with NaNO, or corn steep solids as the nitrogen source, it should be
borne in mind that the higher yields of commercial penicillin produc-
tion employing this strain are obtained with media containing both
NaNO, and corn steep solids, and supplemented by phenylacetic
acid or other penicillin precursors. From the data presented it is
evident that P. chrysogenwm is able to achieve a total synthesis of
penicillin from the basal medium when supplemented with certain
amino acids as sole sources of nitrogen. These include several
amino acids of low molecular weight, including glycine, alanine,
beta-alanine, serine and threonine; the dicarboxylic compounds,
glutamic acid and aspartic acid ; asparagine; proline and hydroxy-
proline; and arginine.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The low values obtained with leucine, isoleucine, valine, histidine
and tyrosine are believed not to be significant, in view of the pos-
sibility of the presence of small quantities of impurities in the amino
acids used. Essentially negative results were thus obtained with
cystine, cysteine, methionine, histidine, lysine, leucine, isoleucine,
norleucine, valine, tryptophane, tyrosine and phenylalanine. The#Misc-exposition*]
[@408 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@results with cystine and cysteine are necessarily inconclusive, since
mycelial growth is a prerequisite for penicillin formation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No explanation is readily apparent for the finding that certain
amino acids are able to participate in the biosynthesis of penicillin,
while others cannot. The suitability of a given amino acid for
penicillin formation cannot be correlated with its rate of oxidation
by P. chrysogenum (Wolf, 1948), or with its suitability for my-
celial growth. The fact that only amino acids with six or fewer
carbon atoms are effective, and that a number of these are closely
related structurally or metabolically, would suggest that the carbon
skeleton may be important. It has recently been shown by Knight
(1948) that P. chrysogenum Q-176 deaminates both alanine and
methionine, liberating one molecule of ammonia for each atom of
oxygen consumed. Therefore, penicillin formation from methio-
nine is not blocked by failure of deamination to occur. This would
suggest that the various keto-acids resulting from amino acid de-
amination might be most important in relation to penicillin biosyn-
thesis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Moderately good agreement was obtained with the findings of
Cook and Brown (1947). Identical results were obtained in each
case with serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine, proline and
asparagine, which take part in penicillin formation, and with valine,
isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine and lysine, which do not.
The results do not agree in the case of tyrosine, cystine, histidine,
tryptophane, glycine and alanine. Further, the present results are
in agreement with those of Halpern e¢ al. (1945), except in the case
of hydroxyproline. The discrepancies noted are probably attrib-
utable to the use of different mold strains, which may well exhibit
metabolic differences of this character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@None of the amino acids proved superior to nitrate as a nitro-
gen source for penicillin formation, thus confirming the finding of
Foster et al. (1943) with surface strain of P. notatum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to other known functions of corn steep liquor in pro-
moting penicillin formation, it would appear from the present data
that the suitability of this material is due, at least in part, to its con-
tent of the amino acids usable in penicillin biosynthesis; namely,
alanine; arginine, glutamic acid, proline, threonine, and aspartic#Misc-exposition*]

[@acid, which together, according to Cardinal and Hedrick (1948),
make up about 54 per cent of its nitrogen content.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@When grown on a basal medium with the addition of single
amino acids as sole sources of nitrogen in quantities equivalent to 50
mg. per cent of nitrogen, Penicillium chrysogenum Q-176 is able to
produce small amounts of penicillin from glycine, alanine, beta-
alanine, serine, threonine, arginine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glu-
tamic acid, proline, and hydroxyproline. No penicillin is pro-
duced from leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, valine, histidine, lysine,
cystine, methionine, cysteine, tryptophane, tyrosine, or phenyl-
alanine under identical conditions. None of the amino acids tested
is superior to nitrate as a source of nitrogen for penicillin bio-
synthesis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 2 FIGURES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The use of smear techniques (McClintock, 1945; Cutter, 1946)
recently has advanced the study of chromosomes in the ascomyce-
tous fungi. The present paper reports a brief survey, carried out
with such methods, of the chromosome numbers of several species
belonging to different genera of the family Hypocreaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It has recently been shown that homothallic forms of Hypomyces
solani Rke. et Berth. emend. Snyd. et Hans. (FIGS. 1F and 2F) have
six chromosomes in the haploid stage (Hirsch, 1949+), while the
heterothallic 7. solani {. cucurbitae Snyd. et Hans. may have four
(FIGS. 1E and 2E), three or two chromosomes, depending on the
sex of the isolate (Hirsch, 1947). It was therefore of interest to
examine the chromosome number of the closely related genera
Gibberella, Calonectria and Nectria. We have so far studied only
species of these genera in which there is a conidial stage belonging to
the imperfect genus Fusarium. The following were studied:
Gibberella roseum Lk. emend. Snyd. et Hans. (homothallic), G.
lateritium Nees emend. Snyd. et Hans. (heterothallic?), Calonec-
tria rigidiuscula (Berk. et Brme.) Sacc. (homothallic), Neciria
episphaeria f. coccophila (Desm.) Snyd. et Hans. (heterothallic?).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Perithecia were obtained in the first three fungi by growing them
on water agar, to which was added ground up wheat straw sterilized
by propylene oxide vapor (Hansen and Snyder, 1947), outside
a north window. In the case of Neciria a small piece of a twig in-
fested with scale insects, but also subjected to gaseous sterilization,
was substituted for the wheat straw (Snyder and Hansen, 1947).
The perithecia were fixed and smear preparations of the asci pre-
pared and stained by the method referred to above.#Misc-exposition*]

Although the other species were stained with Barrett’s haematoxylin
or acetocarmine, and could not be stained with the acetic orcein
used, only the latter stain was effective on Nectria. There is also a
remarkable difference in the size of the nucleolus (up to 4.5 in
diameter during early meiotic prophase in Nectria, and up to 2.6 µm
in Hypomyees).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It has been suggested (Snyder and Hansen, 1945) that the gen-
eric distinction between Nectria and Hypomyces is doubtful in those
species which have Fusarium imperfects. Similarly, the validity of
retaining both the genera Gibberella and Calonectria has been ques-
tioned. Although the difference in chromosome number would ap-
pear to suggest a possible basis for distinction between genera in
these two cases, it must be remembered that different chromosome
numbers frequently occur within a single species, as has been shown
in H. solani (Hirsch, 1947). Much more needs to be known about
the homologies of the different chromosomes before cytological
observations can help us to form a clearer idea of taxonomic rela-
tionships. In this connection, species of Nectria and Hypomyces
which have imperfect stages other than Fusarium will have to be
studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In September 1947, the senior writer collected at Garden City,
Kansas, a plant of Colby milo that showed the characteristic symp-
toms of milo disease caused by Periconia circinata (Mang.) Sacc.
as described by Leukel.? The following October, portions of the
diseased roots of the above milo plant were placed in a petri-dish
moist chamber for observation. After a few days, the character-
istic P. circinata was evident at a number of points (FIG. 1, A). In
addition, another somewhat similar fungus, very evidently a spe-
cies of Periconia, was noticed, in some cases coming from the
same rootlets that showed P. circinata. The conidiophores, how-
ever, were erect instead of being circinate as in P. circinata, and the
conidia, although they were globose, were distinctly larger and their
surfaces were very much rougher than those of P. circinata (FIG.
1, B-E).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subsequently, single-spore cultures were made of the unidentified
fungus and these were used in a soil inoculation experiment to test
the pathogenicity of the fungus in comparison with P. circinata.
Sand-cornmeal cultures of each fungus were mixed separately at
two rates (16 oz. and 32 oz. per flat) with sterile soil and each lot
af inoculated soil was placed in a different flat, 12 x 24 x 3 inches.
Two additional flats were filled with similar sterile soil for controls.
To one of these, 16 oz. of the sterile medium was added, and to the
other, 32 oz. Seed of susceptible and resistant Colby milos, as#Misc-exposition*]

the flats kept in a warm greenhouse.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Periconia circinata attacked the susceptible but not the resistant
milo, the same as reported by Leukel,* while the other grasses were
not attacked. After six weeks, in the soil inoculated at both rates
with P. circinata, the susceptible milo plants ranged from 1 to 2 in-
ches high while those of the resistant milo ranged from 20 to 21
inches. The plants of both the susceptible and the resistant milos
in the control flats averaged about 20 inches high.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The unidentified species of Periconia attacked neither of the milos
nor any of the other grasses. In the soil inoculated at both rates

ceptible and resistant milos averaged about 20 inches high and were
comparable with the controls in vigor and color.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is evident, therefore, that the unidentified species of Periconia
differs both morphologically and pathogenically from P. circinata.
It likewise differs distinctly from the rough, globose-spored species
of Periconia, listed by Linder.’ It differs distinctly also from P.

in the prominent, conical spines or papillae on the walls of the

[@discharged in the binucleate condition. Each basidium produces
four binucleate basidiospores. The spores are not all to be found
at the same stage of development on any one basidium. Frequently
all stages of development may be observed on the same basidium.
Generally the basidial cell nearest the teliospore is the last to pro-
duce a basidiospore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Not all of the basidia of this rust are four-celled. A small pro-
portion of them are three-celled. In such atypical basidia one cell
contains two nuclei and each of the other two cells contains a single
nucleus. The explanation for the occurrence of such basidia is to
be found in a study of the relationship of cross wall formation to
nuclear division. In most cases it is the middle cell of the three-
celled basidium which is binucleate (FIGS. 7-9, 11). It has al-
ready been pointed out above that in the normal course of events
the first cross wall in the basidium does not generally appear until
the second meiotic division is in progress, or occasionally not until
the division has been completed. In a few cases the first septum
fails altogether to appear, while the two second division septa de-
velop normally. This produces a basidium with a uninucleate cell
at each end and a binucleate cell in the middle. Furthermore, the
middle cell contains a nucleus from each of the second division
spindles. There is no overlapping of spindles in the basidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Very rarely a three-celled basidium is found in which either the
proximal or the distal cell is binucleate and the other two are uni-
nucleate (FIGS. 10,12). Two basidia of each type were observed
during this study. In such basidia as these, it is apparent that the
first septum developed normally, but one of the two second division
septa must have failed to appear. The binucleate cell in such a
basidium would obviously contain a pair of daughter nuclei derived
from a spindle af the second meiotic division.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The three-celled basidium continues its development by producing
three basidiospores instead of four. Each uninucleate cell gives
rise to a normal basidiospore, while the binucleate cell gives rise
to a basidiospore into which both nuclei migrate (FIGS. 11, 12).
These two nuclei then undergo a mitotic division and a quadrinu-
cleate basidiospore is produced (Figs. 13, 14). These quadrinu-
cleate basidiospores are conspicuously larger than the normal binu-
cleate ones, as the photographs show.#Misc-exposition*]
[@424 Mycologia, Vow. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@An attempt was made to determine approximately what percent-
age of the mature basidia are three-celled. Well over a thousand
basidia were examined to obtain this estimate. From this study it
appears that about 0.75 per cent of the basidia are of the three-
celled type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@There occur in the literature on rust cytology several references
to certain rusts which normally produce basidia with one or more
binucleate cells, and these cells produce basidiospores that are bi-
nucleate at their origin. Lindfors (1924) studied a race of Puc-
cinia arenariae which produces two-celled basidia that give rise to
two binucleate basidiospores. These spores in turn produce binu-
cleate mycelia upon infecting the host. Thirumalachar (1945)
found in Cystopsora oleae two types of basidia—one, the typical
four-celled basidium, and the other, a two-celled basidium with
binucleate cells. The two-celled basidium produces two binucleate
spores. Thirumalachar further claims that the “diplophase” (di-
karyophase) is initiated in the basidiospore and that the basidio-
spore, upon infection of the host, gives rise to a “diploid” (dikary-
otic) mycelium. This concept is probably correct, although verifi-
cation with experiments in monosporidial infection is needed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently the writer (1947), in a cytological study of basidial de-
velopment in Sphenospora kevorkianii, found that this rust typi-
cally produces three-celled basidia. One of the cells, usually the
middle one, is binucleate and produces a binucleate basidiospore.
The other two cells, which are uninucleate, produce uninucleate
basidiospores. It is considered likely that the binucleate spores,
at least in the majority of cases, are heterokaryotic, but verification
of this is lacking.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Gymnosporangium clavipes, the basidium is normally four-
celted and produces four basidiospores that are uninucleate at their
origin. However, a mitotic division occurs just before the spore
is discharged so that each spore normally contains two nuclei at
maturity. Such a condition is common in the rusts and many other
heterobasidiomycetes and it does not mean that the spore is hetero-
karyotic. On the contrary, these two nuclei are probably genetically#Misc-exposition*]
[@Olive: Basidial Development 425#Misc-exposition*]

[@alike. The basidiospore produced by the binucleate cell of the
atypical basidium, however, is binucleate at its origin and becomes
four-nucleate by a mitotic division of each nucleus before spore dis-
charge. It seems likely that the majority of these spores are
heterokaryotic. It is now generally acknowledged that segregation
of factors may occur in both meiotic divisions in the basidium. If
segregation of compatibility factors should occur in the first divi-
sion, then the central binucleate cell, which receives a nucleus from
each of the second division spindles, would be heterokaryotic for the
compatibility factors. If segregation of these factors occurs in the
second meiotic division, the spore has an equal chance of being
heterokaryotic or homokaryotic for the compatibility factors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Infection experiments with these atypical basidiospores should
prove quite interesting. Although, in G. clavipes, the percentage
of such spores is small, they could probably be distinguished in na-
ture from the binucleate spores by their larger size. Also it should
be possible to locate some of the three-celled basidia before they
discharge their spores. One might suspect that the atypical spore
would be capable of infecting the rosaceous host and could produce
a dikaryotic mycelium that would give rise to aecia. Of course
there is the other possibility, less likely, that the spore might infect
the gymnosperm host, Juniperus virginiana.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A careful study of other species of rusts which normally produce
four-celled basidia would probably reveal the presence of a certain
percentage of these atypical basidia and basidiospores. There is
some indirect evidence in the literature which lends support to this
belief. There are numbers of instances in which an investigator,
while working with monosporidial infections in heterothallic rusts,
has occasionally obtained an infection which produced aecia. In
several cases such results have been marked off to poor technique
or to contaminations. In other instances the investigator has sug-
gested that the dikaryon may have arisen spontaneously in the my-
celium within the host. In view of the present findings, the writer
believes that such results may have been obtained, in a number of
cases, through the use of heterokaryotic basidiospores. Further
investigations are needed to determine if this theory is correct.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Gymnosporangium clavipes the basidia are normally four-celled
and four-nucleate and each cell gives rise to a basidiospore which is
uninucleate at its origin, but becomes binucleate before discharge
by means of a mitotic division of its nucleus. A small percentage
of the basidia are three-celled. One of the cells of the atypical
basidium is binucleate and the other two are uninucleate. The
binucleate cell gives rise to a basidiospore which is at first binu-
cleate but which becomes four-nucleate as a result of mitotic divi-
sions. The four-nucleate basidiospore is believed to be in the ma-
jority of cases heterokaryotic. The possible role of this type of
spore in the life cycle of the rust is discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE TAXONOMY OF SEPTOBASIDIUM
POLYPODII AND S. ALBUM#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. N. Couch#Misc-exposition*]
[@(with 25 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several members of the Auriculariales have been described as
parasitic on mosses and ferns. These belong in the genera Jola,
Eocronartium, and Herpobasidium, the first two occurring on
mosses and the last on a fern. In 1929 the writer described as
Septobasidium Polypodii a new fungus parasitic on the sori of
Polypodium sp. Since the vegetative structure was not too un-
like that of certain species of Septobasidium and the probasidia and
basidia were quite similar to those of that genus, it was classified as
a Septobasidium in spite of the absence of scale insects beneath the
stroma. Later studies by Boedijn and Steinmann (1931) and the
writer (1938) have shown that all species of Septobasidium live with
scale insects. On the basis of this very distinctive feature, S. Poly-
podü has been excluded from the genus Sepiobasidium. In 1939 the
late Dr. Linder sent me a fungus which was growing as a parasite on
the lower side of the leaflets ofafern. The resupinate habit, the pro-
basidia and thrice-septate basidia suggested a relationship with the
fungus formerly described as Septobasidium Polypodit. It is the ob-
ject of this paper to give descriptions of these two species on ferns,
to discuss their taxonomic positions, and also to present new obser-
vations on Septobasidium album, showing that it should be trans-
ferred to the genus Helicogloea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two species on fern would seem to be distinct enough from
Jola and Eocronartium on mosses and from Herpobasidium on fern
to justify the establishment of a new genus. Since the fruit body is
flattened it is being called Platycarpa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Determining the relationships of the present genus offers con-
siderable difficulty. At one time the writer (1938) suggested a
relationship between Platycarpa (Septobasidium) Polypodii and
the very peculiar genus Goplana, which is considered by Raciborski
(1900) as intermediate between the Uredinales and Auriculariales.
Goplana now seems to the writer to be closer to the former than
to the latter order since its hymenium lacks hyphal tissue inter-
mingled with the basidia. In Platycarpa the fructification consists
of a comparatively large amount of sterile hyphal tissue, near the
top surface of which is formed the hymenial layer composed of
sterile hyphae, probasidia, and basidia, much as in certain species of
Septobasidium. The present genus can be distinguished from
Septobasidium by the invariable association of the latter with scale
insects. Of all members of the Auriculariales it would seem to be
closest to Jola and Eocronartium, both parasitic on mosses. Jola
and Platycarpa can be distinguished by habitat, the former occur-
ring on mosses, the latter on ferns. Also in Jola the probasidia are
thin-walled and are formed in clusters, while in Platycarpa the
probasidial walls are somewhat thickened and these structures are
formed singly. Eocronartium, an obligate parasite on mosses,
seems closely related to Jola, a suggestion further confirmed by the
recent discovery by Stanley (1940) and others of probasidial cells
in Eocronartium. This genus is readily distinguished from Platy-
carpa by the fact that the former occurs on mosses and by the
probasidia and basidia. In Eocronartium (perhaps also Jola) the
hyphae are thin-walled, much septate, and apparently only one kind
of hypha is formed. In Platycarpa the hyphae are thin- to thick-#Misc-exposition*]

[@walled with rather infrequent septations and the hyphal system is
more complex. Another difference between the two is in the ex-
tent of the nourishing hyphae. In Eocronartium the hyphae ex-
tend through the stems and many of the leaves of the parasitized
gametophytic thallus (Fitzpatrick, 1918), while in Platycarpa the
nourishing hyphae are quite limited in extent. The genus Cysto-
basidium was transferred to Jola by Patouillard (1900) but it seems
best to me to follow Gaumann (1922) and treat it as a distinct
genus. Both species of Cystobasidium have been reported as over-
growing other fungi, both lack hymenia, and both have clamp con-
nections; all of these are characters which readily distinguish
Cystobasidium from Jola and also from Platycarpa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Herpobasidium described by Lind (1908) and stud-
ied by Jackson (1935) occurs on ferns as an obligate systemic para-
site and must be compared with Platycarpa. The following is taken
largely from Lind and Jackson with some additional notes made
from an abundance of dried material furnished me by Dr. Jackson.
When mature the diseased areas show on the upper leaf surfaces
as small brownish spots. On the under surface of such areas a
white, mould-like growth is visible. Sections of these spots show
abundant intercellular mycelium and conspicuous coiled intra-
cellular haustoria, usually in the mesophyll but also in the epidermal
cells. Branches from the intercellular mycelium emerge in fascicles
through the stomata and these threads continue to branch and
spread over the lower leaf surface, forming a very thin (8-34 µm
thick) covering in the material examined by me. (Lind gave the
thickness as 1 mm., width as 2mm. and length as 4 mm.) The
basidia arise from these horizontal hyphae, but in thin sections
these hyphae are so sparse and inconspicuous that about all one can
see are the basidia. As nearly as I could make out there are no
sterile hyphae intermingled with the basidia in Herpobasidium, in
sharp contrast to Platycarpa in which there is a fruit body com-
posed of a relatively large amount of sterile tissue and relatively few
probasidia and basidia. The coiled haustoria in Herpobastdium
and in. Plaiycarpa Polypodii are quite similar, but the striking dií-
ferences in the fruit bodies in these two genera would serve easily to
distinguish between them.#Misc-exposition*]
[@434 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Jackson: “It is perhaps unimportant whether one
considers Herpobasidium a member of the Auriculariales or a sim-
plified form of the Uredinales. In any case it serves to emphasize
the probable close relationship between the two groups.” Platy-
carpa occupies an intermediate position between the Septobasidiales
and the Auriculariales similar to that of Herpobasidium between the
latter order and the rusts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems that Platycarpa occupies a rather significant position in
the evolution of such a highly specialized order as the Septobasidi-
ales, In the Uredinales the most primitive genera grow on ferns.
In the Septobasidiales no species has yet been found growing on
ferns, but it is probable that Platycarpa might represent a sort of
ancestral type of this order. At any rate, Platycarpa, which so
strikingly resembles Septobasidium and is excluded from that genus
only because of the fact that it is not associated with scale insects,
furnishes a good connection between the Auriculariales and the
Septobasidiales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Uredinella, parasitic on scale insects, represents a similar transi-
tional form between the Uredinales and the Septobasidiales, being
close to Septobasidium in its association with scale insects and re-
lated to the rusts in that the “hymenial” layer in one species may be
composed of a compact layer of teleutospores without sterile threads
(Couch, 1937) and thus is a true sorus. Indeed the teleutospores
of Uredinella coccidiophaga are so much like those of certain spe-
cies of Uromyces (¢.g., U. Fabae) that it is difficult to know whether
Uredinella should be in the Uredinales or in the Septobasidiales.
Thus we find rather striking interconnections between these three
orders: Jola and Platycarpa connect the Auriculariales and the
Septobasidiales; Herpobasidium, Goplana, and other genera repre-
sent intermediates between the Auriculariales and the Uredinales;
while Uredinella is intermediate between the Septobasidiales and
the Uredinales. In spite of the fact that these orders are so obvi-
ously interconnected it would seem unwise to merge them into one
or two at present. The Uredinales comprise a highly specialized
group of obligate parasites which have for the most part a rather
poorly developed vegetative mycelium but through “chemical stimu-
lators" have put their hosts to work for them in the accumulation#Misc-exposition*]
[@Couch: Septobasidium Polypodii and S. Album 435#Misc-exposition*]

[@of food for reproductive purposes. The Septobasidiales represent
a parallel and very highly specialized order living symbiotically
with colonies of scale insects and parasitizing certain individuals.
The vegetative or nourishing mycelium in this order is rather
poorly developed but is exceedingly highly specialized, absorbing
food material from the living parasitized insects. The Auricu-
lariales, containing the Auriculariaceae and the Phleogenaceae, are
made up of a hodgepodge of genera. Some of these are inter-
related while others may not even belong in the Heterobasidio-
mycetes. All of these genera with the possible exception of Herpo-
basidium have a well-developed vegetative mycelium. The com-
monest, best known, and most typical genera in this order (Auricu-
laria, Helicogloea, and Platygloea) have well-developed fruit bodies
and are saprophytic except for one or two species which are facul-
tative parasites. (The parasitic genera in this order are discussed
by Fitzpatrick (1918).) Though no one has made a study of the
vegetative mycelium in any of these saprophytic genera, it is very
likely that in all of them the nourishing mycelium is quite extensive.
In addition to the rather striking physiological distinctions be-
tween these three orders, which I have emphasized above, there
are also morphological differences.#Misc-exposition*]

in protoplasm, 7~12 X 50-70 µm, elongated, club-shaped, thickest at
the distal end, constricted at one or several places, straight or bent,
sometimes forked, forming a discontinuous layer one to several
hundred microns below the upper surface. Rarely the probasidia
may grow toward the surface of the fungus. Basidia 8-10 x 37-
50 µm, typically 3-celled, with a long stalk that often forms a sterigma
and spore ; basidia arising from the base of the probasidium or from
the upper part of the “primordial cell” or rarely from the apex of
the probasidium when it is directed upward in the hymenium;
sterigmata arising from near the top of each cell, usually short, 5-8 µm
long, sometimes forked into a long and a short branch, bearing
respectively a large and a small spore; rarely two sterigmata of
equal length may arise on the end of the apical cell of the basidium ;
spores hyaline, ovoid, 7-9 X 10-15 µm, slightly flattened on one side
and with a truncated proximal end and a minute papilla to which
the sterigma is attached ; germinating by repetition.#Description*]

[@This fungus was first described by Burt as a species of Sepio-
basidium but was excluded from that genus by me (1938) because
of the close association of Septobasidium with scale insects and its
invariable habitat on living plants. The position of the present
fungus has remained in doubt until this past fall when in the course
of studies on a new and remarkable heterobasidiomycete I exam-
ined herbarium material of Helicogloca and found that the spores
of Septobasidium album were like those of Helicogloea, The spores
of this genus, as noted by Baker (1946), are very characteristic.
They are typically ovoid to ellipsoid and usually flattened on one
side and have a prominent blunt protuberance at the proximal end.
The small papillate mucro which is attached to the sterigma is at
the edge of the truncation away from the flattened side of the spore
(Fries. 18, 24, 25). Further studies, particularly of sectioned ma-
terial, showed the much-elongated probasidial sacs from which the
basidia arose. Great difficulties were encountered in interpreting
the probasidial structures. This was due to the fact that the first
material studied was teased apart instead of sectioned and I mis-
took the irregular probasidia for basidia, It was only after a
study of sectioned material which showed the large probasidia with
their broader ends directed away from the surface that the relation-
ship between the two structures was partly understood. It was
noted further that the probasidia are very irregular in shape, whereas#Misc-exposition*]
[@438 Mycologia, VoL. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@the basidia are always nearly straight-cylindrical. Material
teased apart in 7 per cent KOH, washed and then lightly stained
with cotton blue or weak gentian violet and studied immediately,
helped in showing a connection between probasidial cells and
basidia. The probasidia collapse after they become empty and the
usually long and twisted hypha or stalk between the probasidium and
the basidium empties into the latter; hence this connection is diffi-
cult to follow. Several examples were found in teased material
where the empty and partly collapsed probasidium was connected
with a partly collapsed basidium. Typical probasidia are shown
in figure 16. These are shown hanging downward. They are
really growing away from the surface of the hymenium and are
pendulous only if the fungus is growing on the upper surface of the
substratum, which I strongly suspect it seldom does, and hence the
probasidia would usually have the growing (larger) end directed
upward (see Boedijn, 1937). In figure 15 the probasidia are shown
with their growing points directed away from the surface. This
sketch was made from a comparatively thin and young section. In
sections of older plants the probasidia are sunken deeper in the tis-
sue and the region of coiled hyphae is considerably thicker. On the
far left of the same figure is shown a probasidium germinating at
its base to form a basidium initial which is growing toward the sur-
face. The third (from the left) probasidium is empty and partly
collapsed and is indistinctly connected by dotted lines to an empty
and collapsed basidium. Left of this collapsed basidium is one with
spores attached which apparently arose from a probasidium with its
growing end directed toward the surface. Third from the far right
is a basidium full of protoplasm, connected indistinctly to an empty
probasidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The probasidia in this genus are furnished with walls so thin
that the wall would perhaps serve little or no protective purpose
against desiccation. The lack of a thick protective wall is com-
pensated for by the sinking of the probasidia into the tissue. This
reaches an extreme in H. indica where the probasidia are located
near the base of the fructification (Boedijn, 1937).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Baker (1946) points out that the species of this genus fall into
two groups, one with a mucous-gelatinous fructification, the other
floccose or hypochnoid. The present species is closer to the floc-#Misc-exposition*]

the size and color of the fructification, in the structure of the hyphae
of the context, particularly in the spirally coiled hyphae near the
outer surface, and in the size and shape of the probasidia, basidia,
and spores. The two seem to differ in texture, H. contorta being
floccose while H. alba is Corticium-like and rather firm and tough.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new genus of the Auriculariales is described. It is named
Platycarpa because of its flattened fruit body and is based on two
species, both of which are parasitic on tropical ferns. One of these,
Platycarpa boliviensis, is described here for the first time; P. Poly-
podii, previously described as a Septobasidium, is transferred to
Platycarpa and is considered the type species of this new genus.
Platycarpa is compared with Jola and Eocronartium on mosses
and Herpobasidium on ferns and shown to be distinct from each of
these. The possibility that Septobasidium may have arisen fram
such a genus as Platycarpa is discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus described by Burt as Septobasidium album is trans-
ferred to the genus Helicogloea as H. alba because of the striking
similarity in probasidial, basidial, and spore characters, as well as
in the vegetative characters.#Misc-exposition*]

John Stevenson, and G. H. Cunningham for the loan of herharium
material, and to Mrs. Alma H. Beers for inking most of the

[@Attention has been called to the existence of this genus of pore
fungi in North America by the discovery in 1943, and the subse-
quent collection between 1943 and 1948 at several locations in
Oregon and Washington, of specimens of a most unusual species
of “Fomes.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@In July, 1948, the writer visited the Botany Department at the
University of Washington in Seattle and was shown and lent a
portion of a large fungus which had been given to D. E. Stuntz.
Several specimens collected by A. H. Smith and D. E. Stuntz
(FIGS. 8-10) in Mount Rainier National Park intensified the
writer’s desire to know more about the specimen obtained in Se-
attle. A lead was available through Charles Gardner Shaw of
the Department of Plant Pathology, Washington State College of
Pullman, Washington. Through conversations, and later cor-
respondence, with C. R. Allison, he learned of a giant “Fomes”
collected in Lewis Co., Wash., which had been placed on display
in the office of the Weyerhauser Lumber Co., Longview, Wash.
It was discovered that other similar but smaller conks had been
sent to L. O. Overholts by J. L. Bedwell of the Portland Office
of the Division of Forest Pathology, Bureau of Plant Industry,
Soils and Agricultural Engineering, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture.
It became referred to facetiously by foresters who were ac-
quainted with it as "Fomes fuzzii-sandozi" because of its fuzzy ap-
pearance and the fact that the first specimens found in Clackamas
Co., Ore., in 1943, were collected by the brothers Ali and Fred
Sandoz. In 1946, Jacob Hisey found a large specimen, one of the
largest fungus fruit bodies known, in Lewis Co., Wash. It weighed
at least 300 Ibs. and measured 56 x 37 inches. At least, among#Misc-exposition*]

(2) indicate the inclusion of O. ravidus, a non-stratose species not
reported from North America, treated as a Trametes by Pilat (19).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the genus Fomes Kickx (10) there are several groups of
species which seem to have little relationship to each other.
Fries (9), followed later by Winter, Killermann and others, divided
the genus into six or more sections, related to each other only by
the presence of a tubular hymenium, perennial habit, and woody or
near-woody structure. In the section "Laevigati" were placed spe-
cies which were not rimose, did not have a crust, but whose surface
was smooth. Into this section, then, fell the fungus referred to as
Fomes populinus or F. connalus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1925, Bourdot & Galzin (3) in France established a subgenus
in the genus Coriolus for Fomes connatus. Quélet had already
placed this species in that genus and Bourdot and Galzin set it apart
from other species as the subgenus Oxyporus. In 1933, M.A. Donk
(8) elevated Oxyporus to generic rank. He placed two common
species in this genus: Fomes connatus and Poria obducens. Pilat
(19) in Czechoslovakia, Imazeki (11) in Japan, Bondarzew and
Singer (2) in Russia, and Singer in the revised Farlow Herbarium
arrangement, have followed Donk in this although Bondarzew and
Singer have indicated that they have emended the genus to include
an acystidiate form of O. obducens and a non-stratose species, O.
ravidus. Included with Oxyporus in the tribe Oxyporeae, Bondar-

[@Aside from the large size of most of the known conks of this
fungus it has many interesting features which set it aside as distinct
from all other known species of the genus Fomes and its segregates
except Oxyporus populinus described below. Upon first glance one
is struck by its similarity to this fungus, which grows only upon
hardwood trees. The tubes are separated by layers of white tissue
and the context is white (FIG. 10), but there the macroscopic simi-
larity ends. Microscopically, both species have capitate incrusted
cystidia in the hymenium (FIGS. 3, 6, 7).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The surface of the specimens of O. nobilissimus is covered with
loosely interwoven, stiff, matted fibers giving the appearance (FIGS.
9-10), as suggested by A. H. Smith in his field notes, of some
Tremellodendron species. The individual fibers of this mat are
rounded to flattened. They are composed of elongate, hyaline,
thin- to slightly thick-walled septate hyphae which are arranged
parallel or somewhat interwoven but densely compacted. These
hyphae do not have clamps, are not flexuous and are not gelatinous.
The fibers which are made up of these long straight hyphae are
50-200 µm in diameter, and branch and anastomose freely. The
mass of fibers originates from the context in which the hyphae
which produce the fibers are densely interwoven with other hyphae.
The fibers leave the context, with the hyphae which compose them,
already in their parallel arrangement. These bundles of hyphae
leave the context parallel to it, tangential to the cap surface, and
are renewed at intervals (FIG. 10). These intervals may not cor-
respond to the seasons of growth in which the tubes are renewed in
additional layers but their effect is similar. Thus within this sur-
face layer, which may be as much as 5 cm. deep, there may be a
number of increments of this tissue distinguishable by white to
light colored areas probably indicating areas of renewed growth in-#Misc-exposition*]

appear perpendicular to the conk-surface (anticlinal rather than
periclinal) this is probably caused by crowding through increasing
growth, or realignment in older areas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The context of the sterile tissue between the tube layers and above
the oldest tube layer beneath the fiber mat is composed of densely in-
terwoven hyphae which are hyaline, septate, not clamped, 34 p in
diameter. The context is trametoid, there is no distinction between
the tube trama and the context. The sterile tissue between the
tube layers is white and varies in thickness from 0.25 to 3.0 mm.,
but is mostly between 0.5 and 2 mm. (FIG. 10). This tissue is
leathery to corky or woody. Between the tube layers and the fiber
mat at the upper surface, the context is between 0.5 and 2 mm.
thick.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In treating certain tropical polypores E. J. H. Corner (4, 5) de-
veloped a system of classification of tissues within the trama on
the basis of the types of hyphae of which they were composed.
This system was recently further elaborated and used as the basis
for the systematic treatment of New Zealand polypores by G.
H. Cunningham (6). According to this system of hyphal classifica-
tion two hyphal types are represented in the Mt. Rainier specimens
as well as in the Lewis Co. giant. The generative hyphae are
those which produce the basidia and the cystidia. The greater
part of the tissue of the conk is composed of skeletal hyphae.
These hyphae are of Cunningham's "long type" and they are the
hyphae which develop into the elongate fibers of the surface mat.
Binding hyphae are not present so that this fungus represents a
dimitic hyphal type without clamp connections. In Cunningham's
classification (7) the fometoid fruit body with a dimitic hyphal
system without clamp connections is characteristic of Fomitopsis.
This concept represents an emendation of Karsten’s original con-
cept of this genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the section devoted to cover tissues in Lohwag’s “Anatomie”
(13) there is no mention of a tissue such as the one on the surface
of the conks of this fungus. Lohwag’s cover tissues are all rela-
tively simple ones and the hyphae of the different kinds of derms
and cutis are relatively simple, not compound bodies such as the
fibers of the mat described above. Study of other compound#Misc-exposition*]

North America which could be assigned to this genus. No other
species which had layers of white context between the layers of
tubes was known to Lloyd in 1915 (12). Baxter (1), in 1948,
says “there are no closely allied species.” Overholts said, in part,
in a letter to J. L. Bedwell dated June 30, 1943: “It appears to be a
good species of Fomes of the white context group but the pileus
covering is so different from any other Fomes that I am at a loss

[@The above description of O. nobilissimus was drawn from field
notes by A. H. Smith and laboratory notes by the writer. The
description of O. populinus was drawn from several descriptions in-
cluding those of Lowe (14), Donk (8), Baxter (1), Pilat (19),
Bourdot and Galzin (2), and from notes by the writer. The
synonymy of the latter species was drawn from Pilat (19), Donk
(8), and Baxter (1). In addition to the above synonyms Pilat
lists "Polystictus populinus var. connatus Fr., El. 92. 1825." This
is an inaccurate citation since Fries did not raise Polystictus to
generic rank until 1851 and the Elenchus was published in 1828.

noted in the transcription of Fries' letter, he lists those decades of
his Scler. Suec. sent to Schweinitz at that time, stating that the
lacking numbers would follow. A check of the specimens from
Fries in the Schweinitz herbarium, as represented in the Michener

My dear Sir:

My friend Liliencron, whose company I have enjoyed for over a
year, is about to return to his homeland. Since he is so fortunate
as to be one of your acquaintances, his kindness made it possible for
me to write this letter, a pleasure 1 had anticipated for a long time.
Your invaluable papers on mycology, a branch of science which is
also my favorite, have my highest esteem, and I am taking the liberty
of sending you a few hundred fungi of North America, hoping that
this will please you. A considerable part of these fungi you will
find mentioned in my little contribution which Dr. Schwägerichen
had submitted for publication to the Leipzig Society. Thé others
have been found since and as far as I know are only described in my
unpublished papers. If agreeable to you, I could send the most
desired of the 1600 species which I have found here and in my
previous dwelling place in North Carolina. (However 1200 of
these are also found in Europe.) 1 have your book to the end of
the Fungi Clavat. and found it useful. After becoming familiar
with the system of Dr. Nees von Esenbeck, a system which is also
yours, I have accepted it fully and have classified my fungi accord-
ingly. If time would permit, I could inform you of many interest-
ing facts observed by me, and which are by no means unimportant
for the physiology of the fungi. With your permission I shall do
so at some other time. My shipment to you contains a list of all
species which are missing in my collection (which has nearly 3000#Misc-exposition*]

this or that. If you should be so kind as to wish to enter into cor-
respondence with me, I would ask you to send anything designated
to me under the address of Rev. L. D. de Schweinitz, Bethlehem,
Northhampton County, Pennsylvania, care of the Swedish con-
sulin New York. It would please me to receive also phanerogamic
rareties. Lack of time—I am about ready to leave for a long
official trip to Ohio—forces me to cut this letter short. Please
pardon me kindly if my request should inconvenience youre I am

dry; hymenophore lamellate, consisting of rather thick, decidedly
decurrent gills with frequently rather obtuse edges and waxy-gel-
atinous consistency ; lamellae moderately close, subclose to distant,
arcuate, later descendant, gray to fuliginous when mature; spore
print between “bone brown” and black, usually fading out to deep
rusty brown in old spore prints; spores melleous to gray, fusoid to
ellipsoid-cylindric, smooth, with thin to slightly thickened but sim-
ple non-amyloid walls and without a germ pore; sterigmata usually
with a very broad base, mostly four on a basidium; basidia volumi-
nous and variable in length ; cystidia present on the edges and on the
sides of the lamellae, often appearing more scattered in old speci-
mens because of the collapsing of the walls, sometimes slightly
colored but more often hyaline except for a colored resinous incrus-
tation, large, thick- or thin-walled, originating in the subhymenium ;
trama thick, consisting of an often rudimentary mediostratum. a
lateral stratum of non-divergent hyphae, and an irregular hymen-
opodium which is rather indistinctly limited from a filamentous-
intermixed or filamentous to filamentous-cellular subhymenium;
hyphae without clamp connections; stipe frequently with a yellow
lower portion ; context thick in the middle of the pileus and at least
in some parts of it (especially under the cuticle) strongly reacting
with most of the usual inorganic reagents; veil present, cortinoid or
glutinous-hyaline, rarely glutinous and fugacious at an early stage;
mycelium white or colored, forming mycorrhiza with conifers.

[@DOUBTFUL AND EXCLUDED SPECIES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gomphidius roseus (Fr.) Karst. sensu aut. amer. The Euro-
pean species stands out because of its outwardly viscid but not en-
tirely glutinous veil which would make it key out with G. septen-
trionalis, its constant association with Pinus silvestris and Suillus
bovinus (L. ex Fr.) O. Kuntze, its rosy pileus (“light coral red” to
“coral pink” at places reaching “carrot red,” and margin near
“pale flesh color” or “pale salmon color,” or entirely in the latter
colors), which makes it comparable with the American pink species,
and the characteristic habit (short stipe, tapering downward to a
slightly warm yellow or more often pink base). The spores are of
the size found in section Macrosporus, viz. 17.3-24 X 5.8-7.5 µm; ba-
sidia 60-70 x 9-10.8 p, 4-spored; cystidia 100-120 x 11.6-17.5 µm,
rather numerous, little or not incrusted, cylindric or cylindric-
ventricose, hyaline; subhymenium and trama as in G. oregonensis ;
chemical reactions similar to those of G. glutinosus but the base
of the stipe reacting the same way as the infrahypodermial zone.
The American authors mentioning G. roseus have not seen the real
G. roseus but one of the American pink species, i.e., G. septentrion-
alis, G. Smithii, G. nigricans, G. subroseus (especially var. homo-
basis) and perhaps G. oregonensis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SOME LEAFSPOT FUNGI ON WESTERN
GRAMINEAE-—IV *#Misc-exposition*]

[@Roderick Sprague ?#Misc-exposition*]
[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@A study of additional collections of leafspot fungi on Gramineae,
made in the interim since the last paper in this series was
published, has disclosed the presence of additional noteworthy
species in the mountains and plains of the west? The recent
seasons have been exceptionally favorable for the development of
leaf fungi on Gramineae in Washington and adjacent areas. The
precipitation from Sept. 1, 1947 to May 26, 1948 at Pullman,
Wash., was 27.46 inches, compared with the 1893-1944 average of
17.94 inches for the period. The April precipitation was an inch
over average and uniformly spaced, while that for May was 4.45
inches compared with an average of 1.47 inches for the month.
The result of the prolonged, cool, overcast period with almost
unbroken high humidity was an outbreak of leafspots unequaled
in a quarter of a century. Septoria tritici Rob. in Desm. is an
example. This species, which was found in considerable abun-
dance in eastern Washington in June 1948, had not been collected
east of the Cascade Mts. since 1915, even though it had been care-
fully searched for in other years.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spermospora subulata (Sprague) Sprague. What was for-
merly believed to be a relatively rare leafspot was found in abun-
dance on Melica spectabilis Scribn. at Togwatee Pass, Wyo. It
was, at least locally, very destructive, causing a blight of the
entire plant. The brown, blasted plants were readily broken off
at the ground line, leaving the bulbous culm-base in the soil.
Many of the spores in this material were without a distinct, elon-
gated apical appendage. However, some of the spores were typi-
cal of the fungus as originally described on Melica subulata® The
area where the diseased host occurred was a sub-alpine, semi-
forested meadow or prairie where the Melica grew in open spaces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Linear, light brown to paler spots on leaves of Agrostis alba L.,
collected by Fischer, Meiners and Sprague at Teton Pass, Wyo.
(C.S. 20,123), had spores typical for S. subulata except that an
obliquely attached basal cilium about 10 X 0.4 µm was found on
approximately 35 per cent of the spores in one mount. Spores of a
second mount from the same collection, however, were virtually de-
void of cilia. On referring back through all other available collec-
tions we found no cilia in material on Melica spp., nor on Des-
champsia caespitosa, and one or two spores with cilia in material
collected on Calamagrostis. We cannot find any difference in these
various collections except in the occasional presence of cilia in some
of them. While this is somewhat startling we are not segregating
the two forms, ciliate and aciliate, except to the minor extent of
emending the description of Spermospora to permit inclusion of
the ciliate forms, and to present a formal description of the ciliate
group as a morphological form of S. subulata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ovularia pusilla (Ung.) Sacc. and D. Sacc. on Festuca

in Idaho Co., Idaho, was eventually determined as being caused
by O. pusilla. The black to purple-black lesions encircle the fili-
form or involute leaves and extend along the culm for a distance
of 0.5 to 1.5 cm. While the lesions are numerous and relatively
prominent, the hyaline conidiophores are difficult to find except
on older lesions which have faded to an ashy hue. These older
lesions are often bordered by wine-colored tissue. The spots were
abundant on Idaho fescue growing along slopes above the South
Fork of the Clearwater River, Idaho. This spot has been found
on this host elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest but earlier collec-

[@This species appears to be more parasitic than most Phoma-like
fungi on Gramineae. The lower leaves of current season foliage
turn yellow after invasion, The pycnidia are somewhat imbedded
in fungus tissue, which gives a black appearance to the lesions.
However, this tissue is interrupted and more or less Phoma-like.
The fungus is related to a number of Phoma and Phyllosticta spp.
with microspores (FIG. 1, A) but warrants recognition because of
the very small spores. Its parasitic habit distinguishes it from
the numerous saprophytic forms which are more or less morpho-
logically similar. It would appear inadvisable to assign this
fungus to one of the saprophytic types.#Misc-exposition*]

[@two collections on Poa spp. are, perhaps, somewhat distinct from the
narrowly fusiform, 1- to 3-septate yellow spores found on Festuca
(FIG. 1, B) and other hosts. One collection on Poa gracillima
Vasey from Logan Canyon, Utah, made in 1947 (C.S. 3644),
had cylindrical to subfusiform, yellowish, guttulate, 1-septate
spores 16.5-19 x 2.2-2.7 µm borne in golden brown pycnidia 50-
110 diam. Another collection on P. secunda Presl, from the
South Fork of the Clearwater River, Idaho (C.S. 17,113), had
sub-cylindrical spores 16-18 x 2.5-3.4 µm. The spores were guttu-
late, then finally faintly l-septate and yellow. These are similar
to an earlier collection on Festuca idahoensis made along the
Feather River in California (FIG. 1, C). Both collections had
pycnidia which were scarcely ostiolate or tardily so. The material
from Idaho gave some indications that the fungus was weakly
parasitic as the pycnidia were in bleached to brown spots on dead
parts of senescent leaves. The host in the Idaho material was
taken from a rocky ledge which had, in recent years apparently,
heen overgrown with timber. Hence the habitat during this very
wet year was abnormally unfavorable for this particular prairie
species of Poa. We have seen little evidence that H. culmicola
var. minor is actively parasitic. It appears to be a primary in-
vader of dying leaf, culm or sheath tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

diameter. The spores were mostly l-septate, coarsely cylindrical,
somewhat bent and resembled Ascochyta utahensis Sprague when

were coarse and faintly tinted. The spores measured 28-35 x

[@Stagonospora vexatula Sacc. on Deschampsia. An immature
pycnidial form on necrotic leaves of D. caespitosa (L.) Beauv.
was obtained in a ditch near Plummer, Idaho, by the writer and

slightly erumpent in lines in fuscous or stramineous spots, glohose,
flattened, ostiolate, parenchymatous, golden brown by transmitted
light, 110-170 µm diam. The spores were hyaline, 30-40 x 4.5-
5.5 µm, with numerous coarse oil drops and were 3-septate but evi-
dently immature. They were cylindrical but somewhat pointed
at the apex and slightly rounded at the base, giving them a slightly
fusiform aspect in some cases. These spores seem to answer the
description of St. vexatula Sace. which occurs on Phragmites com-
munis Trin. The pycnidia are much larger on Phragmites but it
is believed that the ample food available in the culms and sheaths
of Phragmites can account for this difference. St. veratula is an
early invader in necrotic leaves of the giant reed and it is probably
only dubiously parasitic on Deschampsia. Since it shows some
morphological similarities to the parasitic species St. foliicola
(Bres.) Bubak it may warrant further observation as it may in
some cases prove parasitic under the favorably humid habitat of
Deschampsia. The harsh wiry leaves of this host are, however,
in general, very resistant to invasion by leaf-spotting fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Black stem on grasses. A number of collections were made
of a black stem disease on various species of grasses in northern
and west-central Idaho in 1948. The stem for several inches or
sometimes its entire length was black as though it had been
burned. In one specimen on Festuca elatior L. near Post Falls,
Idaho, small subsuperficial black pycnidia were formed and the
entire blackened area was invaded by very fine, dark, somewhat
superficial mycelium. The pycnidia contained hyaline microspores
46 x 0.5 diam. These were spermatia-like and some of the
pycnidia appeared to contain ascogenous initials. This specimen
(C.S. 17,079) is filed in the herbarium of the Dept. of Plant
Pathology, W.S.C., under Phoma sp. I see no reason for de-
scribing this species until detailed work is done with it. The
same fungus was found on Festuca idahoensis Elmer at 10 miles
north of Warm River, Idaho (C.S. 20,051), Targhee Pass, Idaho
(C.S. 17,133), and in adjacent Mont. (C.S. 17,133). Probably
the same fungus was involved in the same symptoms on Festuca
idahoensis near Desmet, Idaho and on F. occidentalis Hook. near
St. Regis, Mont. (C.S. 20,077). Material on F. idahoensis at
McCall, Idaho (C.S. 20,013), was confined to the leaves which
were jet black. No pycnidia were present but small mycelial
aggregates up to 30µm in diameter were scattered among the black
mycelia. A few spores of Cladosporium sp. were present. Black
streaks with numerous erumpent ostiolate pycnidia (30-60 µm) were
noted on culms and sheaths of Agropyron spicatum (Pursh.)
Scribn. and Sm. collected on the South Fork of the Clearwater

these symptoms on a number of other hosts but field examination
failed to disclose any organism and frequently the material was

LATE CHYTRIDS FROM MARYLAND 1#Misc-exposition*]

[@John S. Karling#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 78 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to the polycentric chytrids previously reported by
the author (1949) from Maryland, a large number of monocentric
eucarpic species were collected and isolated from soil and water.
Among these were six new endo- and exoóperculate species which
are characterized by large sporangia with one to several exit
papillae or tubes and coarse, richly-branched rhizoids which usu-
ally arise at several points on the periphery of the sporangium.
Accordingly, they apparently belong in the genus Karlingia which
includes Rhizophlyctis-like chytrids with operculate sporangia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This genus was established by Miss Johanson (1944) for the
long known and commonly occurring chytrid, Rhizophlyctis rosea,
which she found to be endodperculate. She, accordingly, removed
it from Rhizophlyctis and renamed it K. rosea. Since that time
the concepts of the genus have been extended to include exodper-
culate species as well (Karling, 1947). At present it includes
four species, all of which were isolated and grown on cellulosic
substrata and whose occurrence in nature appears to be limited
to such natural media. Four of the Maryland species, on the
other hand, were isolated on chitin and are distinctly chitinophilic.
The other two new species from Maryland were isolated and
grown on onion skin, grass leaves and cellophane, and could not
be transferred to chitin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In all of these species the sporangia and resting spores usually
develop directly from the zoospore as has been described for the
other members of the genus. However, in a low percentage of
the thalli they may develop from a local enlargement of the germ
tube, and in such cases the zoospore cyst may become thick-walled
and persist as an appendage to the sporangium or resting spore.
Also, rare polycentric thalli may occur in all species, as has already
been reported for K. granulata, K. hyalina and K. rosea (Karling,
1947). Furthermore, in most thalli of the Maryland species
numerous rhizoids are present and arise at several points on the
periphery of the sporangium, but it is not uncommon to find
sporangia with only one or two basal rhizoids.#Misc-exposition*]

of faintly rose or pink colored. As a result the protoplasm in the
sporangia is always hyaline to greyish granular in appearance.
Thalli have been grown under a wide variety of temperature and
light conditions, but the sporangia never varied in pigmentation,
as often occurs in K. rosea under such conditions.#Diagnosis*]

[@Another striking difference is the inability of K. chitinophila to
grow on cellulosic substrata. Numerous attempts have been made
to grow it on cellophane, onion skin, bleached grass segments,
filter paper, cotton fibers, etc., without success. It has a distinct
liking for purified chitin, and bits of this material may become
completely overgrown in a few days. However, this species is
not completely limited to growth on this type of substratum, but
like many other chitinophilic species it may grow to a limited
extent on dead keratinized tissues such as skin and hair.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The resting spores also differ somewhat from those of K. rosea
and the other known members of the genus, They vary markedly
in size and shape (FIGS. 3-8) and are greenish-brown in color.
The wall may become exceptionally thick (FIGS. 4, 7, 8), and
within it may occur faint radial lines or striations. Also, the inner
periphery of the thick wall often appears to be irregular (FIG. 7).
The resting spores developed very abundantly in the collections
from Keesville and Frederick, Md. However, in a culture iso-
lated from moist soil from Liberia, Africa,? no resting spores have
developed in the course of fourteen months. Whether or not
heterothallic strains occur in this species, as Couch (1939) re-
ported for K. rosea, is not known, since no attempts have been
made to cross the Liberian culture with the ones from Maryland.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sporangia of K. chitinophila show the same degree of varia-
tion in size, number of exit papillae, position and number of
rhizoids as those of K. rosea, K. spinosa, and K. hyalina. The
small and medium-sized sporangia at the edges of the substratum,
however, often develop long exit tubes instead of papillae. These
tubes taper gradually towards the apex and may vary from 12 to
70 µm in length by 5 to 8 in diameter. During the late stages of
development the tips of the exit papillae and tubes deliquesce,#Misc-exposition*]

[@after which plugs of hyaline material become visible in the orifices
(FIG. 8). At the same time endoópercula form beneath the plugs
at varying depths in the papillae and tubes. Apparently, by this
time cleavage of the protoplasm into zoospore initials has occurred
because the sporangia appear to be filled with fairly well-defined
segments. This phase, similar to that shown in figure 8, may per-
sist from several hours to more than a day before dehiscence oc-
curs. Similar persistence of what appears to be a post-cleavage

[@Saprophytic on chitinous substrata in soil and water along
routes 232 and 234, Charles County, Md.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@This species, as noted above, is characterized primarily by large
exoóperculate sporangia (FiGs. 12, 15) and somewhat stellate or
asteroid resting spores. The latter are slightly similar to the rest-
ing spores of K. spinosa but otherwise the two species differ in
several respects. Karlingia asterocysta lacks the golden-orange
pigmentation of the former species, has slightly larger zoospores
and exo- instead of endodperculate sporangia, and a distinct pre-

dilection for chitin.#Diagnosis*]
[@510 Mycoroaia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Resting spores occur very abundantly in this species, and in
most subcultures studied they developed before and in greater
numbers than the zoosporangia. As shown in figures 9 to 11
they are characterized by the presence of blunt to sharp-pointed,
tapering, conical pegs which vary from 22 to 60 in number per
spore and are 4 to 8µm high by 2 to 4µm broad at the base. Occa-
sionally, the tips of the pegs may be slightly curved (FIG. 10).
In two spores observed the pegs were reduced to warts with the
result that the outer wall was only verrucose. At maturity the
pegs and inner wall are usually dark greenish-brown in color,
while the content of the spore is hyaline and finely granular (FIGS.
9-11).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to its characteristic resting spores, K. asterocysta
may be distinguished usually from the other chitinophilic species
by its low, inconspicuous and barely perceptible exit papillae, which
seldom project much above the surface of the sporangium (FIGs.
12, 15). Nevertheless, their position can be readily detected by
the presence of a large hemispherical area of hyaline matrix under-
neath. In large sporangia these areas may be as much as 15,4
across and extend to a depth of 16 in the sporangium. It must
be noted, however, that in small sporangia the exit papillae may
become fairly conspicuous and up to 11µm high (FIGS. 13, 14).
Therefore, the size of the exit papillae is not always a reliable
diagnostic character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another distinguishing characteristic of this species is the
swarming of the zoospores for a brief period in a vesicle outside
of the sporangium. So far, this has not been observed in the other
chitinophilic species. During dehiscence the operculum is pushed
up and the slimy matrix exudes first to form a globular mass at
the exit orifice (FIG. 16). The emerging zoospores push up into
this mass and expand it, until it finally forms only a thin layer
around the zoospores as in species of Chytriomyces (Karling,
1947B), Asterophlyctis (Antikajian, 1949), and other chytrid
genera. Within a few seconds to 1.5 minutes the zoospores begin
to jerk and move about in the mass, and shortly thereafter they
start swarming actively in a confined and localized area. This
area is bounded by a hyaline, thin, vesicular membrane, which
apparently originated from the matrix surrounding the emerging#Misc-exposition*]
[@Karling: NEW CHYTRIDS FROM MARYLAND 511#Misc-exposition*]

[@zoospores (FIG. 17). They swarm in this vesicle briefly for 50
to 80 seconds, after which it ruptures and the zoospores escape
(FIG. 18). In the case of large sporangia, however, the vesicle
may rupture before most of the zoospores have been discharged,
and its presence, accordingly, is of brief duration.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Saprophytic on chitinous substrata in soil and water from a
ravine near the Monocacy River at Frederick, Md.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@This species resembles K. asizrocysta in having asteroid resting
spores, but the pegs or spines are usually curved and somewhat
hook-like and more numerous. In addition, the zoospores are
markedly smaller and have a shorter flagellum than those of the
previous species. Furthermore, they do not swarm in a vesicle
outside of the sporangium. K. curvispinosa is also more prolific
in growth, and bits of purified chitin usually become completely
overgrown with sporangia and resting spores in the course of two
weeks. Also, it develops unusually fast and may produce mature
sporangia and resting spores in two days. The resting spores
develop as abundantly and rapidly as the sporangia, and because
of their color the chitinous substratum becomes greenish-amber in
appearance within a few days.#Diagnosis*]

[@Unlike the other known species of the genus, the young in-
cipient resting spores are surrounded by a relatively clear zone
of amorphous material in which faint radial lines or striations
occur. The pegs or spines gradually develop in this layer as the
spores mature and appear to be formed from its material (FIGS.
26-28) in much the same manner as Butler (1905) and McLarty
(1942) described for Olpidiopsis. Even in mature spores the#Misc-exposition*]

[@outer boundary of the layer may sometimes persist, so that the
spores appear to lie in a faintly-visible, delicate vesicle (FIGS. 20,
23). In longitudinal view the pegs appear to be pyramidal in
shape, usually blunt and abruptly tapered, 4-7 µm high by 3-5 µm
broad at the base, and curved or hooked at the tip (FIGS. 20-22).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Karling: New Chytrids from Maryland 513#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sometimes they may be so numerous and closely packed together
that they appear to be fused and to form a radially striated outer
wall (FIG. 25). Occasionally, the pegs may be reduced to low
watts, so that the spores are distinctly verrucose. In rare cases
the spores may be echinulate (FIG. 23) or even smooth (FIG. 24).
Their content is evenly granular with a small irregular central
vacuole, and at maturity the outer wall and pegs are dark-amber
or brown in color. During germination they function as pro-
sporangia and form superficial thin-walled zoosporangia. During
this process and for several weeks afterwards the pegs persist as
fairly rigid structures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sporangia vary markedly in size and shape (FIGS. 29-34)
as in the previous species and have from 1 to 3 exit papillae
which may be low and inconspicuous or somewhat cone- or dome-
shaped and prominent (FIGS. 29-33). During dehiscence the
operculum is pushed off, and disappears quickly so that its pres-
ence can be determined only at the moment of dehiscence. Some-
times the sporangia may be stalked (FIG. 33) and stand off from
the substratum to a distance of 25 to 60. Occasionally, ingrow-
ing plugs of wall material occur in the sporangia as in species of
Chytriomyces (Karling, 1947).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The primary characteristics which distinguish this species are
its large exoópercula and zoospores, and smooth to rugose or ver-
rucose, brown resting spores. Its zoospores are considerably#Misc-exposition*]
[@514 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@larger than those of the previously described species, and the
operculum has an unusual relation to the sporangium. At ma-
turity it appears to be pushed up and separated from the spo-
rangium wall and to rest on a hyaline, broadly conical cushion
(FIGS. 36-38). Its appearance and position relative to the spo-
rangium at this stage is somewhat similar to that in germinating
resting sporangia of Physoderma zeae-maydis (Tisdale, 1919).
Sometimes, the distance between the lower edge of the operculum
and the exit orifice may be as much as 3 to 5µm, and the line of
separation between the two structures may be jagged as well as
smooth and even (FIGS. 37-39). When opercula and empty spo-
rangia are examined under the oil immersion lens, however, an
inner vesicular membrane or wall becomes visible, which projects
out of the exit orifice for a short distance. This is particularly
evident in surface and side views of the exit orifice, as shown in
figure 39. Apparently, it is this inner vesicle or sporangium wall
which grows out into the exit orifice and pushes the operculum
up. However, it is not certain that this vesicular membrane is
the inner layer of the sporangium wall as suggested in figures
3640. On the other hand, it may be the wall of an endosporan-
gium of the type present in the germinating resting sporangia of
Physoderma zeae-maydis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Underneath the raised operculum is an almost hemispherical
area of hyaline matrix which may be 12 µm across and extend to a
depth of 16 in the sporangium (FIGS. 36-38). This material
escapes first as the sporangium dehisces and forms a large globule
at the exit orifice (FIG. 40). The emerging zoospores slowly push
up into this globule and expand it. At first the expanding mass
of zoospores and surrounding matrix is almost spherical, but it
soon becomes flattened at the base or even slightly invaginated
(FIG. 41) as more zoospores push up into it. In a short while
the zoospores begin to separate, and at this stage the flagellum is
coiled around the body of the spore (FIG. 42). The ‘flagellum
soon uncoils and begins to beat, and within one to two minutes
after emerging the zoospores swim away. The swimming zoo-
spore is spherical in shape (FIG. 43) with a conspicuous hyaline
refractive globule which usually lies near the base. If zoospores
are trapped in a narrow space they may elongate, and in such#Misc-exposition*]
[@Karling: New Chytrids from Maryland 515#Misc-exposition*]

[@instances the refractive globule appears to lie in a vacuole (FIG.
44). In old sporangia cleavage may be very irregular so that
large spherical, 8-20 µm, zoospores are formed which contain several
refractive globules and have two to eight flagella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another noteworthy character of K. dubia is the thick-walled
and irregularly constricted rhizoids (Figs. 36, 40, 45, 46). This
is particularly distinctive of old and large thalli. In this respect
the rhizoids are somewhat similar to those of K. granulata, with
the exception that the thickening is fairly uniform and may extend
almost completely across the lumen of the rhizoid in the constricted
regions. Constricted rhizoids, however, are not universal in this
species, and in numerous thalli they may be fairly straight with
few or no constrictions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As noted in the diagnosis above, the resting spores are usually
smooth (Fries. 50, 51), but encrusted (FIG. 48), and slightly verru-
cose spores (FIG. 49) occur fairly commonly. Their content is
coarsely but evenly granular with a central, slightly angular
vacuole, and the wall is dark brown in color. So far germination
of the resting spores has not been observed.#Misc-exposition*]

granules. In fact the similarity is so striking that until the rest-
ing spores were found it was identified as K. granulata. In view
of this, extensive illustration of this species is not necessary for

an adequate description of it and only the most striking differences
will be drawn.#Diagnosis*]
[@KARLING: NEW CHYTRIDS FROM MARYLAND 517#Misc-exposition*]

[@Instead of being spherical to oval in shape and brown in color
as in K. granulata, the resting spores are hyaline, smooth and
usually deeply-lobed or irregular in shape and contain numerous
small hyaline refractive globules (FIGS. 62-69). In shape they
resemble the resting spores of the polycentric chytrid, Septo-
chytrium plurilobulum (Johanson, 1943). A few small oblong
and only slightly irregular spores (FIGS. 64, 66, 68) have been
found, but they appear to be exceptional. All spores begin as
globular enlargements of the germinated zoospores, but the subse-
quent growth and enlargement is not uniform. As a result numer-
ous protuberances and lobes develop, and eventually the irregular
and deeply-lobed spores are formed. After maturity they germi-
nate in the typical chytrid manner by forming a thin-walled
zoosporangium.#Diagnosis*]

[@Another characteristic which distinguishes the large and old
sporangia of this species is the structure of their wall. It usually
becomes quite thick and wrinkled or ridged, so that such sporangia
have a distinctive appearance (FIGS. 52, 55, 58). Sometimes the
wrinkling may extend to the basal portion of the rhizoids as well
(FIG. 55). As noted earlier, the rhizoids are usually irregularly
constricted (FIG. 54), fairly thick-walled, coil extensively in the
surrounding water, and may extend for a distance of 1,500 µm. In
exceptional monorhizoidal thalli, the main axis may be up to 28
in diameter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The zoospores (rias. 59-61) are approximately the same size
as those of K. granulata and usually vary from 5.2 to 6.2 p in
diameter. However, smaller, 3.9-4.2 µm, and larger, 6.5—7 µm, ones
may be formed, but these appear to be abnormal. The refractive
granules vary considerably in number and size, and some of them
may be distinctly globular and up to 0.4 µm in diameter. While
swimming the zoospores are spherical, but when they come to rest
and creep about intermittently they become elongate and amoeboid
(FIG. 61). The anterior end becomes lobose and relatively clear
(Figs. 60, 61), while the posterior end contains the granules.
The zoospores germinate readily in water, particularly in the vicin-
ity of the onion skin, and give rise to free growing thalli of which
only the tips of the rhizoids penetrate the substratum (FIGS. 56,
57). Such thalli may develop zoosporangia or resting spores, and#Misc-exposition*]
[@518 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@it is not uncommon to find them intermingled at the edge of the
substratum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The formation of endoópercula is fundamentally the same as in
K. granulata (Fig. 53) and need not be described further. Both
exo- and endoöpercula may occur on the same sporangium (FIG.
52). During dehiscence the operculum is pushed up by the zoo-
spores and may remain attached at one side of the exit orifice or
is carried away. Normally, the first discharged zoospores form
a globular mass at the orifice and then disperse in a short time
while the remainder of them ooze out slowly. Fairly often, how-
ever, the initial globular mass is surrounded by a layer of dense
matrix and may become quite large in diameter as more zoospores
are discharged into it. In such cases the mass may suddenly rup-
ture in localized regions, and the zoospores then stream out in
long strands or tendrils (FIG. 58). The spores appear to be
stuck together, and from 2 to 4 minutes may elapse before they
separate and swim away. In other atypical cases the initial globu-
lar mass may not form, and the zoospores ooze out in long sticky
strands.#Misc-exposition*]

rangia and irregularly constricted rhizoids (rra. 70), but it differs
from them by the presence of a large'hyaline refractive globule
instead of numerous minute granules in the zoospores (FIGs. 76-
78). In this respect its zoospores are similar to those of K. hya-
lina, but differ by their larger size. Karlingia marylandia differs#Diagnosis*]

[@further from this species by having only 1 or 2 exit papillae and
by the lack of conspicuous plugs of hyaline material in them.
Furthermore, instead of papillae it may occasionally form exit
tubes which may be 10 to 15 broad by 26 to 204 long (FIGS.
74, 75). Also, the sporangium wall is usually quite thick, 1.8-
2.6 µm, in K. marylandia and turns brown in old cultures.#Diagnosis*]

[@The development of endodpercula in this species is fundamen-
tally the same as in K. granulata and K. lobata, and they are never
deep-seated in the exit papillae or tubes (FIGS. 70, 75). Nor are
they developed as commonly as the exodpercula. The latter are
usually deeply bowl-shaped (FIGS. 71, 73), thick-walled, and may
persist or be carried away by the discharging zoospores. In a
few exceptional sporangia both exo- and endoöpercula were found
at and in the same exit papilla (FIG. 72). In such cases an exo-
operculum had apparently been formed and pushed up slightly
without the subsequent discharge of protoplasm or zoospores,
after which an endoöperculum developed lower down in the exit
papilla, as reported previously for K. granulata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dehiscence of the sporangium and discharge of the zoospores
usually takes place very slowly so that several minutes may elapse
before the sporangium is emptied. As in the previously described
species the emerging zoospores form a globular mass at the exit
orifice which is at first surrounded by a thick layer of slimy
matrix (FIG. 71). The latter expands and becomes progressively
thinner as more zoospores emerge and finally disperses in the sur-
rounding water without forming a vesicle. Most of the zoospores
are from 5.5 to 6 in diameter (FIG. 76), but numerous smaller
ones may develop in the same sporangium with the larger spores.
These vary from 2 to 3.5 4 in diameter (FIGS. 77, 78) and have a
correspondingly short, 18-20 p, flagellum. Such zoospores degen-
erate in a short time without becoming actively motile.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Besides the six new species described above, K. rosea, the type
species of the genus, was isolated from more than thirty soil col-
lections from various parts of Maryland.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the addition of these new members, Karlingia now includes
ten species, four of which, K. rosea, K. spinosa, K. hyalina, and
K. chitinophila, are strictly endoöperculate. Of the remaining six
species K. asterocysta, K. curvispinosa and K. dubia are strictly#Misc-exposition*]

[@exoöperculate, while K. granulata, K. lobata and K. marylandia
are both exo- and endoöperculate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to present interpretations, Karlingia is very similar
and almost identical to Rhizophlyctis in general appearance, struc-
ture and development. The only fundamental difference is its
operculate sporangia, which is a valid generic distinction. In
Karlingia most of the sporangia and resting spores develop directly
from the encysted zoospore, but in a low percentage of thalli they
may develop as an enlargement of the germ tube. In the majority
of thalli several rhizoidal axes are present, and these usually arise
at several points on the periphery of the sporangium or resting
spore. However, thalli with only two or even one rhizoid at-
tached at or near the base occur fairly often. In Rhizophlyetis,
on the other hand, development of the sporangia and resting spores
as an enlargement of the germ tube has not been reported, but
when these species have been studied intensively this type of devel-
opment will probably be found to occur. Furthermore, thalli with
a single rhizoidal axis have not been reported in Rhizophlyctis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thalli of exodperculate Karlingia species with a single basal
rhizoid are very similar to those of non-apophysate members of
Chytriomyces (Karling, 1945, 1947), another genus of exoöpercu-
late, monocentric, eucarpic chytrids with extra-matrical sporangia
and resting spores, and the same fundamental type of development.
The basic differences between the two genera at present are the
number and position of the rhizoidal axes and the presence or
absence of an apophysis. Rhizophlyctis is closely related to an
inoperculate genus, Rhizidium, and differs from it only by the
presence of several instead of a single rhizoidal axis. Obviously,
the distinctions between many of the chytrid genera at present are
not very sharp, and are often based on slight vegetative structural
differences such as those noted above. When these genera are
better known, several of them will doubtless be merged. Until
that time the exact taxonomic position and relation of Karlingia
to other similar operculate genera will remain uncertain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE TAXONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE OF
SPOROGENOUS BASAL CELLS IN
THE UREDINALES 1#Misc-exposition*]

[@M. J. THIRUMALACHAR AND GEORGE B. CuMMINS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sporogenous basal cells in the uredia and telia of the plant rusts
have been emphasized in recent years as structures of considerable
taxonomic significance. A review of the genera Chaconia, Chryso-
celis, Scopella, and Maravalia, together with synonymous genera,
indicates that the importance of basal cells has been overempha-
sized.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development of teliospores in clusters on basal cells was
recognized by Juel (3) when he established the genus Chaconia.
The genus Olivea Arth. develops similarly. Mains (6), in estab-
lishing the genus Scopella, utilized the presence of well-developed,
laterally free basal cells as a characteristic of primary significance.
The genus Scopellopsis, established by Ramakrishnan and Rama-
krishnan (9), was segregated from Meravalia because of the pres-
ence of basal cells and paraphyses. In this method of sporulation
the spores develop successively from a basal cell. Consequently,
the spores in any one cluster are of unlike ages, as pointed out by
Juel (3). In the genus Puccinia Kuhnholtz-Lordat (4) has des-
ignated this method of development as the fasciculate type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is frequently difficult to demonstrate the method of sporula-
tion with certainty. In the telia of Maravalia achroa (Syd.) Arth.
& Cumm., Scopella cryptostegiae (Vestergr.) Cumm., Puccinia
solmsii P. Henn., P. bottomleyae Doidge, and Xenostele indica
Trium. the basal cells are not conspicuously elongate and conse-
quently are easily overlooked. This is not the case with Scopeila
echinulata (Niessl) Mains, Sorataea amiciae Syd., Hapalophrag-#Misc-exposition*]

[@mium milletiae Syd., Desmella superficialis (Speg.) Syd., and
Achrotelium lucumae (Arth. & Johnst.) Cumm., species in which
basal cells are elongate and readily demonstrable. In a third
group of species, including Scopella lucumae (Diet.) Cumm.,
Achrotelium ichnocarpi Syd., and Bitzea ingae (Syd.) Mains, the
teliospores are also clustered on basal cells but the latter are ex-
tremely difficult to observe because they are neither elongate nor
laterally free. It is possible, using unrelated genera, not only to
demonstrate the wide occurrence of basal cells, but also to prove
the presence of intergradation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The difficulties attending attempts to employ basal cells as
structures of generic significance were discussed by Cummins (1)
as follows: “Basal cells, as other morphological structures, are
presumably subject to considerable variation. There is no rule
by which one can definitely decide when basal cells cease to be
basal cells and become parts of a cellular hymenium. This ques-
tion does not arise in connection with the highly developed basal
cells of Scopella echinulata (Niessl) Mains. It begins to enter
when one studies S. cryptostegiae and S. bauhinticola, however."#Misc-exposition*]

[@During this study telia of several species in different genera
were examined for the presence of basal cells. "These, together
with species recorded or illustrated in the literature, but not pre-
viously mentioned in this paper, are listed below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In most of the rusts listed above the presence of basal cells has

the principal diagnostic character. Basal cells, together with more#Misc-exposition*]

[@important characters, are described in the genera T'egillum, Des-
motelium, Prospodium, and Olivea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The question arises as to how far the use of basal cells in the
segregation of genera is justified. The structure obviously is
variable and may be interpreted quite differently by different in-
vestigators studying similar material. If genera are to be differen-
tiated because of the occurrence of basal cells a multiplicity of
new genera for closely related rusts may result. Since the fascicu-
late type of development is now known to occur in unrelated
genera it is doubtful if it should be accorded generic significance.
We prefer to accept Kuhnholtz-Lordat’s (4) conclusion that it
merely represents one mode of spore development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The telium is universally accorded primary importance in the
characterization of genera of the Uredinales. It is our opinion
that the spermogonium, an organ at least as conservative to
change as is the telium, also provides a significant diagnostic
character. There is little evidence that the spermogonia vary,
within a genus, in their position relative to the epidermis. Ex-
ceptions apparently exist, however, in Ravenelia and Melampsora
as currently constituted. A similar statement applies to telia,
again with exceptions in Ravenelia.#Misc-exposition*]

of generic significance the following key, based on other char-
acters, is given to the group of genera in which basal cells have

UNITED STATES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sister Mary Cecillia Bodman#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 4 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The tremellaceous genus Heterochaete was described by Patouil-
lard (4) from material which Lagerheim had collected in Ecuado:z
in 1892, The genus is essentially tropical or subtropical, and has
been collected in or near the torrid zone in all parts of the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fourteen collections have been recorded from the United States.
The first of these was made by Langlois, in 1897, at Saint Martin-
ville, Louisiana. Five other collections have been made in Louisi-
ana, and six in Florida. One of the remaining collections is from
Kentucky ; the other from the District of Columbia. Burt regards
the collection from the District of Columbia, which was made on
the grounds of the United States Department of Agriculture, as
an import, and the species he erected for it—H. Shearit (Burt)
Burt—has been reported only once since, this time from Guam
(1). The southwestern part of Kentucky is included in the old
gulf embayment, in which the remnants of a tropical flora compete
with oak-hickory forests, and with stands of beech and hard maple.
A single specimen of H. andina was collected at Clinton, in this
region.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Patouillard (2) established the species H. sublivida for the first
collection made in the United States, that of Langlois in 1897.
All other collections made in Louisiana have been determined as
H. andina. One of the Florida collections, made near Miami by
Thaxter, was determined by Burt as H. andina, and I have tenta-
tively, on the basis of external appearance and the general aspect
of the hymenium, assigned to the same species two collections
from Florida which are a part of the Ellis Collection in the New
York Botanical Garden. I have also determined as H. andina a
collection made by C. L. Shear in Florida in 1937. Two collec-
tions made by R. Singer at or near Miami in 1942 are described
in this paper as representing a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@527#Misc-exposition*]
[@528 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two types of fructification are found in the genus. One is
distinctly gelatinous, appearing horny when dried. This type has
not been reported from the United States, although the conspicu-
ous H. gelatinosa (Berk. & Curt.) Pat. (4) has been found in
Mexico. The second type, which characterizes all specimens thus
far found in the United States, is coriaceous or farinaceous in
aspect. All of these collections are moderately thick (more than
75 µm when dried), conspicuous, and heavily incrusted with mealy
granules. The pegs are sometimes visible to the naked eye, and
may always be seen if the specimen is examined with a hand lens.
Some Heterochaetes have been identified as Odontia, Hydnum or
Hymenochaete. It seems quite possible that if tropical collections
of these genera are reexamined, some M of Hetero-
chaete may be found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I am indebted to Mr. John A. Stevenson, of the U. S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture, for the loan of the type of H. Shearii; to
Dr. H. S. Jackson, of the University of Toronto, for the specimen
of H. andina collected by C. L. Shear, and to Dr. Donald P.
Rogers, of the New York Botanical Garden, for the specimens
from the Ellis collection. Dr. Rolf Singer, then of Harvard Uni-
versity, sent his Florida collections. It is with pleasure and with
regret that I recall the courtesies extended to me at the Farlow

[@Color is certainly not a dependable species character, particu-
larly when the color variation is merely a small difference in
shade. Cystidium and gloeocystidium are terms in need of more
precise delimitation. H. Shearii seems to possess both cystidia
and gloeocystidia, although Burt in his vivid descriptions men-
tions only gloeocystidia. Neither cystidia nor gloeocystidia are
mentioned for H. andina and H. sublivida and I have been able
to find neither in H. sublivida, but long, slender, colorless organs
arising beneath the hymenium and extending through it, occa-
sionally becoming apparent above the surface, are easily demon-
strated in almost every specimen of H. andina. In the specimen
collected by F. S. Earle in New Orleans they seem to be clustered,
and are very numerous. These I interpret as gloeocystidia.
Patouillard in discussing the genus (3) remarks, “Parfois des
cystides éparses ou groupées au sommet des émergences,” but I
have found nothing that will meet this description. Attempts to
segregate the species of this genus upon the basis of organs so
poorly defined are, to say the least, precarious.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other histological characters may be of more significance.
The spores of H. sublivida seem to be noticeably smaller and
plumper, the basidia somewhat larger than those of the other two
species. In contrast with this, the structure of the subhymenium
of H. Shearii seems much different from that of H. andina and
H. sublivida. The smaller spores of H. andina have been found
in only one collection—that of F. S. Earle in New Orleans.
These are accompanied by small basidia, and by the numerous
and conspicueus gloeocystidia that were previously mentioned.
It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that when African and
Asian collections are interpolated into the American series a con-
tinuous, smoothly-blending succession of characters which indicate
a single species may be the result. However, further study of the
type material, and of other collections from both hemispheres, is
indicated before any decision is made.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An ascomycete on three specimens of Sabal leaves taken in con-
nection with plant-disease surveys of the United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture (cf. 2 and 4) was identified as Myriangium
sabaleos Weedon (5). Our further study of this myriangiale ap-
pears in a companion paper (3). We are here presenting our
more or less parallel study of a dothideale, Catacauma sabal
Chardon, which we found in abundance on two of the specimens
referred to above. Previously this has not been distinguished
from the myriangiale, and to our knowledge C. sabal has not been
reported from other than the type locality, which is the Dominican
Republic.#Misc-exposition*]

from Georgia (2), viz. on Sabal palmetio, Richmond Hill, De-

nah, December 31, 1943, A. W. Blizzard and Ilo Hein (Blizzard

only the myriangiale (FIG. 1, E and F); on the other specimen,
however, we soon discovered that another ascomycete, a dothideale,
was present in abundance. The third specimen of diseased Sabal#Misc-exposition*]

City, Florida, by A. S. Rhoads, October 27, 1943 (4). On this
specimen are the colorful ascomata of the myriangiale (FIG. 1, G),
identified by Erdman West as Myriangium sabaleos, but much
more numerous are the fructifications of the dothideale (FIG. I,
C). The same condition is true of the type specimen of M.
sabaleos. This specimen also is from Florida, where it was col-
lected on S. palmetio at St. Petersburg, February 13, 1923, by the
author of the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@That this fungus is widespread is further shown by three addi-
tional specimens now available. All are free from the myriangiale.
One is an interception of diseased palm leaves from Mexico made
at Brownsville, Texas, on April 27, 1946, by W. C. Edgeworth
(Brownsville 61009). This specimen was first examined by
Flora G. Pollack, who had been present in 1944 when Blizzard
943 was examined by Limber and had been shown the prepara-
tions of both the dothideale and the myriangiale. Ascertaining
that the fungus on the Mexican specimen was dothideaceous and
that the conidial stage associated with it was the same as that on
Blizzard 943, Mrs. Pollack identifed it as near Phyllachora or
Catacauma. Since it seems to be the dothideale in question, we
are suggesting that the palm may be a Sabal.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The other two additional specimens are both on Sabal texana
from Brownsville, Texas, viz. November 17, 1945, Robert Runyon
4093, and March 7, 1947, D. J. Smith. On the label of Runyon
4093 is essentially this statement: “It advances from the apex of
the leaf toward the base, causing the leaf margins to die. It is
only occasional on Sabal texana. In Brownsville, this palm is
cultivated along sidewalks.” Following Mrs. Pollack’s examina-
tion (at Beltsville) of Brownsville 61009, she also recognized the
dothideale on Runyon 4093. Mr. Smith’s gathering, which we
received while it was still fresh, was made at her behest. It was
upon receiving this specimen of the dothideale that we actually
undertook to identify it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pustules of the dothideale are abundant, especially so on the
specimens of Sabal texana (FIG. 1, A and B). They are more

Texas specimens the pustules have a “seal brown"? cast. Indi-
vidually they are pale to buffish brown, or black. The leaf tissue
immediately surrounding the spot may not be discolored, or it
may be whitish to brown. On the Rhoads specimen the spot often
penetrates the leaf, and a pustule is present on each leaf surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphologically the dothideale is so different from the myrian-
giale [compare FIG. 2 with FIG. 2 (3)] that examined microscopi-
cally the two unrelated ascomycetes may be readily distinguished.
We feel certain that Weedon’s not having noticed the more abun-
dant dothideale on the type specimen of her myriangiale, and like-
wise West’s not having discovered it on the Rhoads specimen,
is attributable to the similar superficial aspect of the two asco-
mycetes [compare FIG. 1, C, with FIG. 1, 4 (3)]. Where visible
[rıe. 1, G, and Fig. 1, a (3)], stromata of the myriangiale are
readily recognized by their red to purple color, such as “pome-
granate purple” or “Bordeaux.” Pustules of this fungus, where
present, are interspersed haphazardly among those of the more
abundant dothideale or the two may be in juxtaposition. In the
young or poorly developed fructifications of either species, it may
be difficult or practically impossible, even in microscopic mounts,
to determine which is present or whether both are involved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our identification of the dothideale in 1947 was simplified by
the fact that only the year before Chardon (1) had described as
Catacauma sabal a fungus that he had collected on dead leaves of
Sabal umbraculifera (Jacq.) Martius (det. L. H. Bailey, fide
Chardon, letter July 17, 1948), in the Dominican Republic, July
11, 1937. To verify our determinafion we corresponded with Dr.
Chardon, who wrote that the structure of the fungus and the
measurements of the spore were in agreement with his descrip-
tion, and stated that the type was at Cornell University. The
type was photographed for us under the direction of Clark T.
Rogerson (FIG. 1, H—-J) and subsequently examined at Ithaca by
Limber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 2 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Weedon's Myriangium sabaleos (10) was described on the
basis of a specimen she collected on leaves of Sabal palmetto at
St. Petersburg, Florida, on February 15, 1923. In 1943 the
fungus was again collected on S. etonia at De Soto City, Florida,
by A. S. Rhoads (7, 5. 275) and in Georgia on S. palmetto at
Richmond Hill and on S. minor at Savannah, by A. W. Blizzard
(2). The specimen from Richmond Hill shows only the myrian-
giale. The other two specimens of 1943, as well as the type speci-
men, were probably collected for the more conspicuous and much
more abundant dothideale fruiting on them. Of these two parasites,
only Catacauma sabal Chardon, as we have identified the dothideale
(4), is known to cause any appreciable harm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The actual leaf spots produced by the so-called Myriangium are
usually small and insignificant. On the dry, young leaf fragments
of the specimen of Sabal palmetio from Georgia, they are elongate,
0.25 X 1.3-5 mm., with the longer diameter paralleling the leaf
axis. They are slightly thickened, minutely wrinkled lengthwise,
pale, sometimes “pinkish buff,” ? with a definite margin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1In the present study we have had the advantage of examining type
material, including microtome sections of the myriangiales described by
Stevens and Weedon (9) and of Weedon's Myriangium sabaleos (10)
deposited in the herbarium, University of Illinois. We wish to thank
Leland Shanor, curator, for so graciously lending us this valuable material.
Likewise, we wish to express our appreciation to Fred J. Seaver, curator
of the New York Botanical Garden, for permitting us to examine the
specimen deposited in the Garden’s mycological herbarium. We are indebted
also to Paul E. Tilford for obtaining for us Miss Weedon’s present name
and address (see footnote 4). To her we are most grateful for help in
tracing the source of the heretofore overlooked error in the generic name of
her myriangiale on Sabal as it appears in the original description.#Misc-exposition*]

the ascomata form in or beneath the epidermis (FIG. 1, B) or in
the mesophyll becoming superficial (FIG. 1, A, b; B, and D),
although they may remain internal. Dense, hyaline hyphae within
the leaf structure may lead from the base of one erumpent ascoma
to that of another on the opposite side of the leaf (FIG. 1, E).
Such a development in Myrianginella tapirae is reported by Stevens
and Weedon (9, FIG. 7), who termed it a “double ascoma.” The
bright coloration of the ascoma is limited to the peripheral region.
Within, the pseudoparenchymatous tissue is hyaline to dilute oli-
vaceous. In some sections, however, the entire mass including#Misc-exposition*]

[@the ascospores becomes stained red to purple from the coloring
matter in the outer part of the stroma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The numerous asci are distributed irregularly throughout the
stroma, but in external fructifications may be concentrated toward
the outer part. The asci are subspherical to obovoid, 21-29 x
17-23 µm, and the gelatinous wall is noticeably thickened (FIG. 2,
C). Ascospores are clavate, straight or curved, and muriform,
with three to five transverse walls and one or two longitudinal
septa (FIG. 2, E). In one instance an incomplete longitudinal
septum was observed (FIG. 2, E) and such has been noted by
Petrak (6) in Myrianginela iapirae. A layer of awl-shaped
conidiophores bearing hyaline conidia (rıG. 2, D) has several
times been seen in locules in the stroma (Fig. 2, F, b). From its
close association with the myriangiales, it seems that it must belong
to that fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As co-author with Stevens in describing three similar species of
myriangiales and discussing their position in the order on the basis
of Theissen and Sydow’s classification (8), Weedon was in a
unique position to describe the similar myriangiale on Sabal. How-
ever, she was handicapped by the presence of the Catacauina in an
old state of development and by the sparseness of the myriangiale.
Her slide made from microtome sections shows that the ascoma
of the myriangiale may become superficial. This character and
the reddish to purple coloration of the ascomata would have placed
the fungus in the genus Myrianginella created by Stevens and
Weedon to describe their M. tapirae. "They separated M yriangi-
nella from Myriangina (Henn.) Hoehn. on the basis of the super-
ficial development of the ascoma in Myrianginella and its intra-
matrical development in M yriangina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In discussing the genus Myrianginella in 1927, Petrak (6) re-
moved Stevens' basis for separating the two genera by reporting
a superficial ascoma for Myriangina mirabilis (Henn.) Hoehn.,
type of Myriangina. This ascoma is illustrated by Jenkins (3,
pl. 2, A), who noted also a copious development of asci in internal
stroma of this species (3, µm. 3). Calling attention to the fact that
in Myriangina mirabilis the fructifications are pale yellow, Petrak
disposed of Myrianginella tapirae by transferring it provisionally#Misc-exposition*]
[@548 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@to the genus Uleomyces, in which the fructification is also red
to purple.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rhoads (loc. cit.) alluded to Miller’s (5) statement that Myri-
angium sabaleos “does not belong to” Myriangium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stevens and Weedon’s account, together with Weedon’s descrip-
tion of her myriangiale on Sabal,® led us to believe that Weedon
actually intended to describe this in the genus M yriangina. When
we referred to the type specimen, we found it labeled "M yriangina
sabaleos n. sp. Weedon." The error represented in the published
description was explained by Miss Weedon (Mrs. Amy G.
Weedon Moore) tpon our corresponding with her. She wrote: +
“In the original manuscript as well as in the first typewritten copy
the name appears as Myriangina sabaleos. However, on the copy
sent the printer I find that the name has been changed to Myrian-
gium. Who is or was responsible I do not know. The writing
is not mine, nor does it look like Dr. Stevens’. The proof was
evidently checked with this copy and thus the error slipped by.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Without further discussion of the genus Myriangina at this
time, except to call attention to the large size of the ascus and
ascospores as compared with those of Myriangium sabaleos (com-
pare FIG. 2, 4 and B, with E and C), we are transferring this
species to Myrianginella. In so doing we are not recognizing
Petrak’s provisional transfer of the type of Myrianginella to Uleo-
myces, but are revising the description of Myrianginella. We are
also revising the description of Myriangium sabaleos in con-
formity with its morphological characters as we have observed
them during the present study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@STUDIES ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND
CYTOLOGY OF THIELAVIA BASI-
COLA ZOPF*#Misc-exposition*]

[@GEORGE BLANCHARD Lucas ?#Misc-exposition*]

[@(with 1 figure)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thielavia basicola was first described in 1876 by Zopf (11)
who found the organism in roots of Senecio elegans and lupines
(12). It has been observed often on tobacco roots in association
with Thielaviopsis basicola, the causal organism of black root rot.
The pathogenicity of Thielavia basicola upon tobacco has not been
demonstrated. Johnson (5) in 1915 believed Thielavia basicola
to be the perfect stage of Thielaviopsis basicola. He reported a
host range of nearly 100 species for Thielaviopsis basicola and
found perithecia of Thielavia basicola in abundance upon Cucumis
maxima, Robinia pseudoacacia, Cytisus scoparius, Nicotiana ta-
bacum and to a lesser extent on numerous other hosts. McCor-
mick (7) in 1925 showed that the two fungi were not related.
She reported the occurrence of Thielavia basicola on the roots of
tobacco, pea, violet and Antirrhinum. McCormick also showed
that an isolate from violet roots, while exhibiting a tendency to
form perithecia when grown in pure culture, was stimulated to
produce perithecia abundantly when grown either with Thielavi-
opsis basicola or certain other fungi or with extracts from cultures
of these fungi. In 1930, Emmons (1) described a soil-inhabiting
species of Thielavia which readily produced perithecia in culture
and which he named T. terricola. This fungus had been isolated
originally by Gilman and Abbott (4) from Iowa and Louisiana
soils and had also been observed on decayed strawberry roots in
North Carolina (1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present discussion is concerned mainly with the morphology
and cytology of an isolate of Thielavia from tobacco roots. An-
other from Austrian winter pea ? and one from soybean * were also
studied, to determine if strains of the fungus exist. All cultures
were grown on several different artificial media and compared
with an isolate of Thielavia terricola kindly furnished by Dr.
C. W. Emmons.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tobacco roots infected with Thielaviopsis were collected and
examined with a dissecting microscope for perithecia of Thielavia.
Roots containing perithecia were plated on Richards agar (9)
minus sucrose. Sterile filter paper was used as a carbohydrate
source instead of sucrose. The medium tested about pH 5 after
autoclaving. The plates were incubated at approximately 37° C.
The above method proved very successful in isolating Thielavia
from tobacco roots.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Single ascospore isolations were made with a Chambers micro-
manipulator. The spores were germinated in Van Tieghem cells
on potato agar and transferred to tubes of oatmeal agar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The perithecia of Thielavia used for sectioning and staining
were produced in pure culture by growing the tobacco isolates on
oatmeal agar in Petri dishes. Blocks of agar from 5- to 10-day-
old cultures containing the perithecia were fixed in weak Flem-
ming’s solution and imbedded in paraffin in the usual way. Sec-
tions were cut 6 4 thick, stained with a 0.25 per cent aqueous
solution of crystal violet and destained with picric acid and clove
oil, according to the procedure recommended by Sass (10). Peri-
thecia were also crushed and the clusters of asci stained with
aceto-carmine or aceto-orcein. While this method proved very
satisfactory in studying the increase in size of the ascus, nuclear
structures were not well differentiated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@tubes. All these cultures except one produced an abundance of
fertile perithecia in 7 to 14 days. The exceptional culture had
fluffy white aerial mycelium but no perithecia. It did produce
a few scattered bodies which resembled perithecia but these never
produced ascospores. When this culture was grown in the same
Petri dish with other single-ascospore cultures no detectable fusion
or stimulation was evident.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nineteen single-ascospore cultures were obtained from an iso-
late of Thielavia from tobacco roots. All cultures produced an
abundance of perithecia containing ascospores. Many additional
mass isolates were obtained from tobacco roots over an eighteen-
month period. In all cases the isolates produced numerous peri-
thecia when grown on oatmeal agar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolates of Thielavia from Austrian winter pea, soybean, to-
bacco and the culture furnished by Dr. Emmons were grown on
Richards agar minus sucrose plus filter paper and incubated at
room temperature. Under these conditions at the end of 10 days
all cultures produced numerous perithecia scattered over the sur-
face of the filter paper. Very little aerial mycelium was evident.
The perithecia contained mature ascospores. At the same time
duplicate cultures of all four isolates were grown on Richards agar
plus sucrose but with no filter paper. At the end of 10 days all
cultures had abundant white aerial mycelium. However, only the
isolate from soybean had produced a sufficient number of peri-
thecia to make them visible to the unaided eye.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The average size of the perithecia produced by the different
isolates on various substrates varied widely. For instance, the
perithecia produced by the soybean isolate on Richards agar plus
sucrose averaged 110.5 µm in diameter. Perithecia produced by
the same isolate on Richards agar minus sucrose plus filter paper
averaged 219.9 µm in diameter. Perithecia of T. basicola found in
tobacco roots averaged 59.7 a in diameter, while perithecia pro-
duced by the tobacco isolate on Richards agar minus sucrose plus
filter paper at room temperature averaged 130.8µm in diameter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All four isolates of Thielavia were also grown on oatmeal agar
at room temperature. At the end of two weeks fifty mature asco-
spores from each of the four isolates were measured. At the end
of two months fifty mature perithecia were measured. These#Misc-exposition*]

[@CYTOLOGY OF THE PERITHECIUM AND ASCUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development of the perithecium of Thielavia terricola has
been described by Emmons (2). The perithecia of the isolates of
Thielavia from tobacco studied herein grew essentially as he de-
scribes. A hyphal coil forms which is soon surrounded by numer-
ous hyphae. The interior of the growing perithecium is filled
with slender, delicate hyphae, some of which are ascogenous
hyphae containing paired nuclei. In the young perithecium, asci
are found in all stages of development from crozier formation to
mature asci. Frequently several asci in various stages of devel-
opment can be seen growing from one hypha (FIG. 1, C). The
ascogenous hyphae measure less than 3 in diameter when the
croziers form. By the time the ascus is almost full grown, nuclear
fusion has occurred and the ascus is characterized by a large
fusion nucleus (FIG. 1, E) with a conspicuous dark-staining nu-
cleolus. This nucleolus is approximately twice the diameter of
the nucleolus seen in the ascogenous hyphae. Forty-five fusion
nucleoli were measured. They ranged from 1.0 to 1.7 µm in diam-
eter. The fusion nuclei were quite large, the average diameter
being 4 microns. More than 200 asci were observed just after
fusion had occurred, or in prophase I, but in no instance were
chromosomes seen which measured over 2.0µm in length. At this#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lucas: Thielavia Basicota Zopf 557#Misc-exposition*]

[@stage it was not possible to distinguish clearly the number of
chromosomes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nuclear divisions in the ascus seemed to follow each other
rapidly. Relatively few figures of the first (FIG. 1, 7) and second#Misc-exposition*]




[@558 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@(FIG. 1, G) division were seen as compared to the fusion nucleus
stages. However, several figures were seen in which the chromo-
some number could be determined as more than three and less
than six. One figure of the second division was seen where five
dot-like chromosomes were visible. None of these measured over
0.5 µm in length. The divisions appeared to occur along any plane
of the ascus. After the third division the nuclei seemed to be
located near the periphery of the ascus. Cleavage furrows ap-
peared in the cytoplasm of the ascus as the ascospores were de-
limited. After the ascospores are mature the asci appear to
deliquesce, leaving the ascospores free in the perithecium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is evident that Thielavia basicola is widespread in the soil.
Zopf reported it from Germany, Peglion (8) from Italy. It has
been found in Connecticut, North Carolina, Louisiana and Iowa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@McCormick (7) found that isolates of Thielavia were stimulated
to produce many perithecia in culture when grown with several
other fungi or extracts from these fungi. The isolate studied by
Emmons (1) produced perithecia in culture without the presence
of other fungi or fungous extracts. On this basis and because of
the difference in ascospore size Emmons assigned a new specific
name to the fungus studied by him.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The observations herein reported indicate that Thielavia basi-
cola, though homothallic, is composed of various strains or forms.
The isolate from soybean, for instance, produced numerous peri-
thecia on Richards agar plus sucrose. The other isolates did not.
Perithecia produced by the Emmons isolate were on the average
much smaller than the perithecia produced by the other three iso-
lates. Perithecia of Thielavia basicola as found in tobacco roots
were on the average smaller than those produced in pure culture.
This was also true of the ascospores. Thus, both size and produc-
tion of perithecia and size of ascospores appear to be dependent
on the source of the isolate and the substrate on which it is grown.
It is doubtful, therefore, if presence or absence of perithecia in
pure culture or minor differences in ascospore size can be used as
valid measurements for delimiting two species in the strains stud-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Lucas: Thielavia Basicola Zopf 559#Misc-exposition*]

[@ied. Very probably the isolate studied by Emmons should be
included as a strain of T'hielavia basicola and not given specific
rank.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The association of Thielavia basicola and Thielaviopsis basicola
is an interesting one. The author has observed Thielavia only on
those tobacco roots which had been infected with Thielaviopsis.
This has been observed by previous investigators (3) and led to
the assumption that Thielavia basicola was the perfect stage of
Thielaviopsis basicola. Attempts (6) to inoculate healthy tobacco
roots with cultures of Thielavia basicola have not proved success-
ful. Yet, perithecia of Thielavia have been observed in the cortex
of roots attacked by Thielaviopsis. It may be that roots infected
with Thielaviopsis are weakened or altered sufficiently to permit
Thielavia to invade the tissues as a secondary organism.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. Thielavia basicola is widespread in the soil. The species is
composed of forms or strains. The production and size of peri-
thecia are dependent on the form isolated and the substrate on
which it grows. Ascospores found in tobacco roots are not as
large on the average as those produced in culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. Isolates of Thielavia basicola were obtained from tobacco
roots. Perithecia were produced in pure culture, sectioned and
stained with crystal violet. Very young to mature asci were seen.
Crozier formation occurred. The large fusion nucleus in each
ascus contained a large nucleolus approximately twice the diameter
of the nucleoli seen in the ascogenous hyphae. Three divisions
occurred in the ascus. At prophase I the longest chromosome was
not over 2 long. At the third division the chromosomes were
0.5 p or less in length.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. Four isolates of Thielavia from different sources were grown
and compared in culture. Indications are that all four isolates
should be included in the species Thielavia basicola Zopf.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It occasionally happens, during the routine of collecting and
identifying fungi, that a species having an unusual type of conidium
and conidiophore is encountered. The two species given brief
consideration herein are believed to be quite unlike any with
which even well-trained and experienced students of fungi are
acquainted, and consequently they are worthy of mention. One
of them has been identified as Cephaliophora tropica Thaxter, and
the other, as an hitherto undescribed species to which is given the
name Ypsilonia corticalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CEPHALIOPHORA TROPICA#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Cephaliophora comprises two dung-inhabiting spe-
cies, C. tropica and C. irregularis, the former being the type, both
of which were described by Thaxter (1903). In the mycological
literature available to the writer it is of more than passing interest
that these species of Cephaliophora have never been recorded by
other investigators.#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. iropica was isolated from materials sent from Jamaica, Java,
Liberia, China, and the Philippine Islands. Presumably this spe-
cies has a wide distribution in the tropics, and has been assumed
to be restricted in range to the tropics. However, the isolates in
hand appeared in cultures from inoculum obtained from decaying
tobacco leaves which had long been in contact with the soil in a
field at Oxford, N. C. On potato dextrose agar and other semi-
solid media vegetative growth is profuse and fructifications are
abundantly formed. The mycelium is loose, cottony, and septate.
The conidiophores are erect, broadly-saccate, and have a short
pedicel. Conidia are initiated as bud-like protrusions from the
capitulum (FIG. 1). They extend outwardly in all directions and#Misc-exposition*]

capitulum, except its basal part and the pedicel (FIG. 3). Each
conidiophore bears from 12 to 20 conidia, and all conidia are
formed simultaneously. The conidia are broadly attached, ovoid#Misc-exposition*]

other genera having capitate conidiophores. The conidia are not
borne at the apices of small sterigmata, as occurs in Oedocephalum.
Moreover the conidia of C. tropica are not thin-walled, as they
are in other capitate hyphomycetes, but have an appearance not
unlike that of conidia of Helminthosporium. In short, Cephalio-
phora is strikingly different and can be distinguished readily from
all other capitate Moniliales.#Misc-exposition*]

not to have been satisfactorily established.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Ypsilonia was founded over one hundred years ago
by Léveillé (1846), with Y. euspidata as the type. This species
was collected near Manila, P. I., where it occurred on the lower
leaf surface of foliage of an unidentified member of the Anonaceae.
Y. vagans was described by Spegazzini (1908). It occurred in-

[@The pycnidia are typically ypsiliform or bifurcate but the angle

[@Léveillé (1846) indicated that the conidia of Y. cuspidata lack
septations but, because of the ratio of their length to width, it
seems unlikely that mature conidia would remain non-septate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The measurements of conidia of Y. vagans are 30-35 X 1 µm,
and no mention is made of septation. In conidia so tenuous,
septations would be difficultly discernible. In addition both conidia
and conidiophores are ternate. Apparently the conidia arise from
the apices of the ternate branches in Y. vagans, but from bifid
branches in Y. corticalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neither Y. cuspidata nor Y. vagans seems ever to have been
collected more than once nor from any other than the type local-
ity. The organism in hand is quite unlike either of these two

[@(with 17 figures)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a previous paper (10) an attempt was made to outline the
course of evolutionary development within the genus Pleospora.
The present paper is the first of several which will attempt to
analyze more closely this situation; to group the collections studied
into workable species, and attempt to find the proper binonmials
for these groups. The collections considered here are the simpler
types which illustrate the origin of the main lines of development
within the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the earlier paper mentioned it was shown that if a large
number of collections having, for instance, a similar spore form
were arranged according to spore size, a long series with over-
lapping spore measurements is obtained, often extending over the
range of many described species. This same situation occurs as
regards almost any pair of unit characters of spore form, size,
septation, color, etc. Although there seem to be an infinite num-
ber of such combinations and variations, there is a certain corre-
lation which allows a pattern of development to be discerned.
Three such general lines of development, based on spore form
and septation, were outlined, and for convenience in the following
discussion the characters distinguishing each are briefly listed
below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leptosphaeroid series:
spores fusoid, strongly tapered at the ends:
spores yellow-brown to dark yellow-brown;
secondary septa laid down as transverse walls in the end cells; verti-
cal septa tardily formed.
Vulgaris series:
spores ellipsoid, ends tending to be more bluntly rounded;
spores often inequilateral to curved ;
spores yellow-brown to red-brown;
secondary septa laid down as both transverse and vertical walls, more
or less simultaneously in the central cells, end cells normally with-
out vertical septa.#Description*]

[@565#Misc-exposition*]
[@566 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@Herbarum series :
spores oblong-ellipsoid, ends broadly rounded or bluntly tapered;
spores more often straight, either symmetric or asymmetric;
secondary septa as in vulgaris series but with additional, vertical, or
"Y" shaped septa in the end cells;
spores yellow- to red-brown, more commonly red-brown.#Description*]

[@The collections discussed in this paper are referred to by num-
bers, which are those of the writer’s files. A list, in numerical
order, with the data for each, is given at the end of the paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should be definitely understood that the delimitation of
species, from such a pattern as mentioned, is of necessity an arbi-
trary one and based upon personal judgment, but such a delimi-
tation is necessary in order to have a basis for future revisions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basic spore form of the genus is a three-septate one. These
first three septa are referred to as the primary septa. The origin
of all the main lines of variation is foreshadowed within this group.
The septation of the three-septate spore is, of necessity, lepto-
sphaeroid, but the form and color changes of other series are
found. P. pellita (*1G. 6) has the typical straight, tapered, some-
times asymmetric, yellow-brown spore of the leptosphaeroid series.
P. trichosioma (FIG. 1) and P. mollis (FIG. 2) represent a small
unrelated group, with oblong spores. In P. oligostachyae (FIG.
9) and P. diaporthoides (Fig. 10) the inequilateral or curved form
of the spore is more pronounced and the ends are more bluntly
tapered. These are tendencies leading to the vulgaris series, In
the broader spores of this type vertical walls are occasionally seen
in the end cells even in three-septate spores, indicating an early
origin of this herbarum-series characteristic. It is in such broad
spores [ie., P. Boldoae (Fig. 12), P. lactucicola (Fig. 13)] also
in which the vulgaris type of septation of the central cells first
appears. Certain species with three-septate spores also show
tomentose or setose perithecia, and specimens on woody substrata
show the elongate asci, uniseriate spores and large perithecia
characteristic of this habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species has been studied rather extensively by various
plant pathologists. Diedicke (3) studied strains from different
cereals and found conidial stages belonging to Helminthosporium
spp., and differences in ability of different strains to infect different
host genera. On perhaps incorrect evidence he excluded from
P. trichostoma all races which produced such Helminthosporium
stages and erected five new binomials (Pleospora teres, P. Bromi,
P. Tritici-repentis, P. Avenae and P. graminea). These were to
apply to the ascus stages of Helminthosporium species occurring
on different host genera and were purely hypothetical in some
cases. No specific descriptions were given. Noack (7) later con-
sidered these species as physiologic forms, which is a more logical
treatment. Drechsler (4) recognized three.of these species and
transferred them to the genus Pyrenophora (P. teres, P. Tritici-
repentis, and P. Bromi).#Misc-exposition*]

[@a. arenaria: with perithecia on discolored spots, 250-270 1; asci
105-120 x 21-23 µm and spores straight, clavate-fusoid, 27-30 x
9-10µm. The elongate asci suggest P. findens, but the broad
clavate spores do not; it is probably merely a well-matured con-
dition in which the asci are stretching for ejection of spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@b. pusilla: with perithecia small, 150—180 a, not in discolored
spots; asci 60-80 x 18—20 4; spores 22-24 X 8-9 µm, with third
cell swollen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@c. Airae: with clustered or seriate perithecia 220-250 µm in diam-
eter; asci 75-90 x 16-18µm and spores 21-26 X 8µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is some variation within the species (see table). There
is one group of collections which seem to have broader, less
strongly tapered spores, with slighter constrictions. These are
placed in the variety arenaria. Niessl’s variety pusilla is most
typical of the species and is retained for the narrower spore type.
Intergrades are, of course, found between these two varieties.,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Berlese (1. vol. 2: 9) gives the spores of the variety pusilla as
larger than those of irae, but his figures (1, vol. 2, pl. 11, figs.
2 µm 3) are both typical of the species as here described. His
figures of spores (1, vol. 2. pl. 12, fig. 1) of the var. Sparganit
Cke. are broader and characteristic of the var. erenaria, as here
delimited. Berlese’s figures (1, vol. 2. pl. 12, figs. 2 µm 3) of
P. donacina Niess| and P. microspora Niess| are also similar to
this species, but Niessl gives the former as having larger, thick-
walled, greenish spores, often with several vertical septa in each
cell, and the latter as 3- sometimes 5-septate. Berlese’s meas-
urements for the spores of P. microspora are only 18 X 8 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type of Pleospora fuegiana Speg. (32) shows scattered
small (150-200 4) perithecia in the leaf tissue of Poa Forsteri
erumpent as minute ostioles. The asci are clavate and 80-85 x
16-18 µm. The spores (FIG. 8d) are typical, in form, of the species,
and 22-26 X 6-7 µm. They are rather long, but have the narrow
tapered form of the var. pusilla.#Misc-exposition*]

[@lanica. The perithecia are flattened and 200-250 x 100—150 ,.
The asci are 70-90 x 14-18µm and the spores (FIG. 8e) are 23-
26(30) X 8-9.5. The material is rather poor, but it fits
Spegazzini's description and the broad spores are characteristic
of the variety arenaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores of P. vagans differ from those of P. pellita not only
in the addition of an extra septum, but also in the more symmetric
but somewhat inequilateral form. The insertion of the extra
transverse septa in the end cells causes the two central cells to
be somewhat larger and the upper (third) cell is often somewhat
swollen, as is commonly found in spores of Leptosphaeria. Col-
lection 23, of P. parvula, is one of those difficult ones which is
intermediate between several species. Some perithecia show
mostly 3-septate spores, others show many spores with one or
two secondary septa laid down in the end cells giving 4- or 5-
septate spores, whereas others show mostly 5-septate spores.
These spores (FIG. 8c) are transitional between P. Ppellita, P.
vagans and those with asymmetrical septation. The perithecia
of this collection have the thick stromatic walls of P. pellita but
the spores are larger and more like P. vagans. It is collections
such as this that suggest that hybridization or perhaps hetero-
karyosis may occur and give rise to spores of two similar types.
Such collections must be placed in a purely arbitrary fashion, as
this one is in P. vagans.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores of P. parvula, as figured by Berlese (1, vol. 2: 5;
Pl. 5, fig. 1), suggest the shorter, stouter spores of P. calvescens.
The long, narrow, cylindric asci and large perithecia of this collec-
tion are also correlated with its occurrence on woody stems, and it
may eventually have to be segregated as a separate species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections: 31 (Type), on Andropogon, from New Jersey.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The above description is taken from the type collection of P.
findens. It differs from P. vagans in the straight spores which
have more nearly parallel side walls and bluntly rounded ends,
giving a more cylindric form. The asci are also longer and nar-
rower, with uniseriate spores, and the perithecia are larger and
contain more interthecial strips (pseudoparaphyses). In these
latter characters it resembles the species of Pleospora on woody
stems, and in fact the spores of this species are very similar to
those of P. atromaculans on Cornus and might be derived from
them by the addition of secondary septa in the end cells.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PLEOSPORA OLIGOSTACHYAE AND P. DIAPORTHOIDES#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is necessary to consider at this point a rather confusing
group of collections, which show the changes in spore form and
septation which lead to the vulgaris series at the 3-septate level.
The spores of some of these collections are very similar to and
difficult to distinguish from those of P. pellita, In some cases it
is necessary to place collections in a purely arbitrary manner.
The general difference of the spores of this group (Frias. 9-13)
is that they are somewhat broader in appearance due to the lesser
taper toward the ends, and tend to be inequilateral or curved, but
symmetric, rather than straight and asymmetric, as in the pelliic
type. The occasional appearance of secondary septa, of the vul-
garis tvpe, in the central cells (see 10), in these collections, gives
rise to spores typical of the vulgaris series. It has also been ob-
served that vertical walls are not uncommonly found in the end
cells of spores which are only 3-septate in some collections. Such
septation indicates an early tendency toward the herbarum series.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The binomial Pleospora oligostachyae is used for the first species
of this group. It is represented by several collections on grasses,
which have spores similar to those of P. pellita but more inequi-
lateral-ellipsoid in form.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collection of P. oligostachyae is typical of this group
of collections on grasses. The spores (FIG. 9c) are perhaps clos-
est to those of P. pellita of this intermediate 3-septate group of
species between the leptosphaeroid and vulgaris series. They dif-
fer from those placed under the following species in being larger,
more tapered and more inequilateral, and they never show vertical
walls in the end cells. Pleospora Andropogonis Niessi may be
this same fungus, but the asci (90-96 x 24-27 µm) and spores
(18-21 x 10-12), as given by Niessl, are definitely broader
than in P. oligostachyae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pleospora hysierioides E. & E., Erythea 2: 19. 1894. The
type collection (61) of this species bears two fungi with muri-
form spores, which apparently were confused by Ellis. One of
these is of the Hysteriographium type with elongate (300-600 x
60-100 µm) flat ascocarps with carbonaceous walls 10-18 µm thick,
and with a longitudinal ostiolar slit. The ascospores of this
fungus are clathrate, flattened, narrow ellipsoid, rather dark
yellow-brown, 3-septate, with vertical septa in the two central
cells in face view, but showing no vertical walls in edge view.
They are 13-18 X 5.5-7.5 X 3.54.5. This same fungus was
apparently described by Ellis (5: 53) in 1900, as Hysteriogra-
phium graminis E. & E. Ellis spore measurements (15-20 x#Misc-exposition*]

[@7-10 x 5-8µm), in both cases, were somewhat larger than those
obtained by the writer. Ellis’ description of the Pleospora indi-
cates that he was referring to this fungus, which must therefore
be the type. The proper binomial, therefore, is Hysteriographium
hysterioides (E. & E.) comb. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species may belong in Petrak’s genus Pseudopleospora,
which is given as having elongate perithecia opening by a slit, but
the spores of his P. ruthenica are given as pyriform and no men-
tion is made of any clathrate character.#Misc-exposition*]

spora with globose perithecia and three-septate spores (9b) like
those of P. oligostachyae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ellis saw both fungi but apparently thought they were the same,
for on a second packet (8) containing a collection on Sporobolus,
made five days later, he says, “Spec. with perithecia orbicular

having a longitudinal dehiscence.” On the paper of the first
packet he has drawings of the Pleospora spores, but on an en-
closed slip there are drawings of the Hysteriographium spores.#Misc-exposition*]

this type collection is sterile. Many of these spores (FIG. 10c)
showed vertical septa in some of the cells, and, in fact, Spegazzini
shows such vertical septa in his figures on the packet. This
should be a Pleospora. These spores are of the general type here
considered, but are rather small (12.5-16 X 4.5-5.5 µm) and yellow-
brown, in which respects they agree with (6). These two collec-
tions might be considered a variety or species, but too few collec-
tions are yet available for such a segregation. The spores of L.
aerea are also more asymmetric and tapered below than the other
collections of this group.#Misc-exposition*]

resembling a Teichospora at maturity. They approach P. cargini-

three-septate and 18-20 x 7-8 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another collection in the N.Y.B.G. (270) on Agave shows
identical perithecial development as in No. 27 but spores of the
P. media type. Berlese, again, describes and figures spores (1,
vol. 2: 6, pl. 6, fig. 2) which he says were taken from Saccardo’s
original material. The figures show more ellipsoid spores with
more rounded ends than those found in No. 27 and they are col-
ored greenish, but the dependability of this color is questionable.
These spores are 3-septate and 18-21 X 7-9 4. He shows no
clypeus about the perithecia, and gives them as 250 µm in diameter.
No. 21 may be the same as P. Thuemeniana, but in the absence of
any definite evidence from authentic material it seems better to
describe it as new. Because of the clypeus this species might be
placed in Phaeopeltosphaeria Berl. but these clypeate blackenings
occur in fungi of many different types and the type of this genus
(P. caudata) does not seem to be related to Pleospora clypeata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The origin of secondary septa, of the vulgaris type, in the cen-
tral cells of such spores as those of P. oligostachyae and P. dia-
porthoides gives rise to 5-septate spores of the type found in the
vulgaris or herbarum series, in contrast to those of P. vagans in
the leptosphaeroid group. This type of septation has no doubt
arisen at various times in various strains and is found in varying
percentages in the spores of different collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PLEOSPORA BOLDOAE AND P. LACTUCICOLA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections whose spores show the transition from the 3- to
the 5-septate condition are also difficult to distinguish from imma-
ture collections of species (i.e., P. vulgaris) whose spores are
definitely 5-septate at maturity, for such immature spores show an
irregular and progressive insertion of additional septa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@P. AMELANCHIERIS#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are several species with 3-septate spores which show
certain characters typical of the wood-inhabiting forms and should
probably be considered as the beginning of these tendencies. P.
clypeata, already described, on Agave, has perithecia which are
large and thick-walled and the asci are long-cylindric and im-
bedded in prominent interthecial strips. In Pleospora atromacu-
lans (FIG. 15) and P. findens (F1c. 7) the spores are oblong in
form, intermediate between the leptosphaeroid and vulgaris type,
but do not seem to be related to P. trichostoma. In P. atromacu-
lans the spores are red-brown and so suggest the vulgaris series,
P. findens, on the other hand, has pale yellow-brown spores which
are 3-septate and differ from P. vagans only in their cylindric
form. P. Shepherdiae (FIG. 16) and P. Amelanchieris (Fig. 17)
have spores which are characteristic in form of the vulgaris series
and grade off into that series by the insértion of secondary septa.#Misc-exposition*]

substrata, but to only a slight degree. The perithecia are rather
large and thick-walled and cause rather wide ruptures of the
periderm. The asci are numerous, somewhat cylindric and with
abundant interthecial strips, but these characters are not as out-

[@In 1944-45, the senior author was on duty at the Army School
of Malariology in the Panama Canal Zone for about sixteen
months. Field work in connection with the teaching and research
activities of the School provided an opportunity to collect dung
at various localities in the Canal Zone and the Republic of Panama.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The dung was collected in the field, dried, packeted, and
shipped to The University of Tennessee. Permission for such
material to enter the United States was granted by officials of
the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine of the United
States Department of Agriculture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the senior author returned to The University of Ten-
nessee in 1946, a taxonomic investigation of the coprophilous
Ascomycetes of Panama was begun. The species reported here
constitute the first published contribution in that study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The dried samples of dung were moistened with distilled water
and placed on moist paper toweling in glass culture dishes of
various sizes and depths, depending upon the size of the sample.
Water was added as needed to keep the dung moist. Examination
of each sample for coprophilous Ascomycetes was made at inter-
vals over a period of four to five months when the substrata were
burned. Dried specimens of all species included in the list have
been placed in the herbarium of The University of Tennessee.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the convenience of those interested, this report follows a
taxonomic arrangement. The distribution data for some species
may be incomplete; however, the general distribution pattern for
each species is fairly accurately defined. Nomenclature of the
Discomycetes is according to Seaver (1942) ; that for the Pyreno-
mycetes is according to Cain (1934).#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. PEYRONELIA SIRODESMOIDES Cif. & Frag. In 1927 Ciferri and
Fragoso proposed this genus and species for a black mold growing
on rotting wood in the Dominican Republic. It was cespitose,
black, woolly, had sterile creeping hyphae which were olivaceous,
septate, and 3-4.5 4 in diameter. It did not have conidiophores,
or these structures were indistinct, being merely the broadened
base of the primary conidium. The conidia were black, 1-8 but
mostly 2-5 in a chain, fusoid, 3-10-septate, 28-60 x 7-15 µm (aver-
aging 35-45 x 9-12 a), easily separating at a narrow isthmus 2-3 p
in diameter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On Mount Shasta a fungus was found on dead sticks of Holo-
discus discolor var. glabrescens Heller which fits this description
well. The spores in the chains are exogenous, 16-43.5 x 10-14 z,
1—5-septate, with the isthmus between the spores 5-6, in diam-
eter. In some instances there seem to be rather distinct conidio-
phores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores are produced on erect conidiophores up to 200-300 pµm
long which are divided into a number of short cells from each
of which one or two spores are produced on short, lateral processes.
The spores are arranged like a row of shingles on the conidiophore.
The spores are black, two-horned, smooth, one-celled. Their
width from tip of horn to tip of horn is 20-40 a; the dimensions of
the spores exclusive of the horns are 8-13.5 x 13.4-16.7 µm; the
horns are 7.5-13.4 X 2.5. The specimen was identified by Lee
Bonar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. DENDRYPHIUM PINI von Hoehnel. A brown mold on Shasta
Fir bark is assigned to this species. On the substratum the mold
develops prostrate ropes of brown hyphae. These ropes are 50-
75 µm in diam. and are composed of mostly granular incrusted hyphae
1.5-4 µm in diameter, although a few hyphae associated with them are
smooth. The smaller hyphae are paler in color. These hyphae
are branched and septate. The spores remain in chains until ma-
turity. The chains are 2-20 spores long and are usually branched.
The apparently erect conidiophores have roughened walls. The

Höhn. It represented the conidial stage, and thirteen synonyms
were listed for it. The second of these, the pycnidial stage, was
Sclerotiopsis concava (Desm.) Shear & Dodge under which twelve
earlier names were placed in synonymy. It is possible that
Hoinesia borealis Ell. & Ev., which has spores borne in acervuli

[@There exists a large group of species, all of which are very sim-
ilar in spore form and perithecial structure and to which the
species just described belongs. They have fusoid, hyaline, spores
with a characteristic "biconic" form, strongly constricted at the
middle, swollen on both sides of this septum and tapered toward
the ends, usually inaequilateral or curved. These spores are usu-
ally 2-celled at first then 4-guttulate and then 4-celled. In some
cases they may turn brown at extreme maturity. They may or may
not have a gelatinous envelope, which in the writer’s opinion is un-
important but it is used as a diagnostic character of the Mas-
sariaceae. The color and septation of the spores vary with ma-
turity and with the species, but it is often difficult to distinguish be-
tween these two factors because of overlapping types. As a re-
sult, these fungi, though closely related, are to be found in a number
of genera. They are related on the one hand to certain species of
Didymella and the genus Massarinula in the Massariaceae and on
the other hand to certain species of the genus Mefasphaeria and
Massarina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The perithecia have a structure similar to that common in the
Massariaceae, with numerous persistent paraphyses. The fungus
here described is very similar to Massarina eburnioides Sacc., M.
pomacearum Hohn. and M. corni (Fckl.) Sacc. Hoéhnel (Ann.
Myc. 15: 361. 1917) has already noted the similarity of these
species and their relation to Metasphaeria, when the gelatinous
envelope about the spore is lacking. Massarinula lignorum has the
same large spores, but these have no gelatinous envelope and they
remain, for the most part, two-celled. Although they possess four
large guttulae, and a few cases were seen in mounts in Amann’s
solution where the spore protoplast seemed to be four-parted, most
spores were definitely two-celled as seen in this medium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@B. SOME SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH SAMBUCUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@On July 25, 1946, the writer collected at Bear Springs, 5000 ft..
Mt. Shasta, Siskiyou Co., Calif., material identified by comparison
with material distributed from Northport, Washington, by Science
Service, Ottawa, as Exosporium sambuci Tracy & Earle. The Mt.
Shasta specimen was distributed as no. 208 in the “Mycobiota of
North America.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently in checking over material in that part of the C. V. Piper
collections housed in the Herbarium of the Botany Department of
the State College of Washington, specimens were found of Brachy-
sporium puccinioides E. & E. and Brachysporium pedunculatum
Ell. & Ev. from Pullman, Washington. "These specimens compared
favorably with the material from Mt. Shasta, Northport, and a
more recent collection from the top of the White Bird Grade, 4400
ft., Idaho Mountain, Idaho Co., Idaho, W. B. Cooke 23807, June

[@In order to clarify the status of these specimens material of Exo-
sporium and Brachysporium species on Sambucus species was
kindly loaned by B. B. Kanouse, University of Michigan; H. M.
Fitzpatrick, Cornell University ; D. P. Rogers, New York Botani-
cal Garden; J. A. Stevenson, Mycological Collections, Beltsville,
and G. W. Martin, State University of Iowa. In addition to speci-
mens of these species, material of Heterosporium and Helmintho-
sporium was obtained. It was thought that since Brachysporium
had been confused with Exosporius it was possible that some col-
lections filed under these genera might belong to this complex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Exosporium was first described by Link (Mag. Ges. Naturf. Fr.
Berlin 3: 9. 1809). It was used again by Link in 1825 in Vol.
6, part 2, of Wildenow’s 4th edition of Linnaeus’ Species Plan-
tarum. Fries reduced the species of Exosporium to synonymy in
Helminthosporium since he considered these species as only stro-
matic members of this genus. If it is noted below how later work-
ers have confused Brachysporium, a segregate of Helminthosporium,
with Exosporium, one can see how Fries could have placed Exo-
sporium in Helminthosporium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@gamen Flora, ed. 2, Vol. 9, p. 362, 1910, used Exosporitun and indi-
cated that this was in accord with von Hóhnel's treatment. In
1923, von Hóhnel accepted both genera and added Phanerocoryn-
eum to the group. He distinguished them by assigning to Exo-
Sporium erumpent, cartilaginous species, to Phanerocoryneum spe-
cies which were superficial, with longish, loosely arranged conidia,
and to Cryptocoryneum superficial species with long, cylindric,
many-celled conidia which occur in dense bundles. Clements and
Shear, Genera of Fungi, 1931, indicate that the difference between
Cryptocoryneum and Exosporium is that in the former the sporo-
dochia are superficial, in the latter they are erumpent.
Exosporium sAMBuct Tracy & Earle. In 1898 Tracy and
Earle distributed as No. 1104 in their “Plants of Colorado” under
this name a fungus collected on Sambucus melanocarpa along the
La Plata River at 10,000 feet, Durango Co., Colorado, by C. F.
Baker, F. S. Earle and S. M. Tracy. In this material the sporo-
dochia are visible as black elliptical spots under splits in the bark
which may have originated at the lenticels. The sporodochia de-
velop on or below the cambium. The lesions are 0.5-3 x 0.1-0.5
mm. They may eventually become confluent although this is not
particularly evident in the two specimens of the type collection
from the New York Botanical Garden. The large size is attributed
to the large sporodochium rather than to the confluence of more
than one sporodochium. The sporophores are densely packed
together, 5-6 µm in diameter, septate, yellowish, and are often decid-
uous, remaining attached to the spores, even after rough treatment
in making crush mounts. The conidia are ovate to obovate, yel-
low-brown, usually 3-septate (although 2-septate spores are seen
in every mount), usually constricted at the septa, in spite of the
fact that in the original description it is stated that they are not
constricted, and measure 40-44 x 17-20 p. ; i

the sporophores may become detached along with the spores, mak-
ing them appear “pedunculate.” The sporodochia in the Revel-
stoke collection measure 0.25-0.5 mm. in diameter. Confluence
may increase this size to a half centimeter or more in length.
The conidiophores are 12-15 x 6-7 µm, septate, yellowish. The
spores are produced terminally. The conidiospores are 22-30 x
12-15 „in the type collection, 25-36 X 14.5-18 „ in the Revelstoke
collection, and the other collections examined have spores of similar
or intermediate dimensions. The spores are two-septate, brown
to dark brown, usually constricted at the septa, with a swollen cen-
tral cell which gives them a blunt fusiform to barrel shape. Some
of the spores are flattened on one side and this, with the swollen
central cell, gives the spore a “Curvularia” aspect. The original
description, and Ellis’ notes on the type packet at the New York
Botanical Garden, indicate that Ellis did not notice the constric-
tions at the septa. All the spores observed were two-septate.

has sporodochia it is placed in the Tuberculariaceae. Since ma-

spores produced on sporodochia it should be placed in the Tu-

ulate and produce multiseptate dark spores acrogenously or, more
usually and in mature specimens, acropleurogenously. The co-
nidiospores are smooth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Heterosporium was used first by Klotzsch in Herb. mycol. n. 67
and 69, 1832, for a phragmosporous dematiaceous fungus with
rough spores. It was also used in this sense by M. C. Cooke
(Grev. II. 122. 1877). While it is not so indicated in Lindau's
description, the illustrations in the accompanying specific descrip-
tions show acropleurogenous, geniculate conidiophores so that this
fungus is essentially a repository for species of fungi like Helmin-
thosporium with roughened spores. Lindau indicates that Hetero-
sporium Klotzsch ex Cooke is mostly parasitic while Helsnintho-
Sporium is mostly saprobic. This is not a usable delimitation
since a large number of species of Helminthosporium are parasitic.#Misc-exposition*]

fungi whose conidia are roughened and produced acropleurogen-
ously on geniculate conidiophores. It was based on Helmintho-

branched hyphae which stand erect from the substratum. No
sterile hyphae were seen, nor are any described by other workers.
The conidiophores may range from 100 to 500 µm long by 6 to 8 µm in
diameter. They are simple or branched and when branched the
branches become interwoven to form the observed felt. Near
each septum may be produced 1-4 spores giving the conidiophores
a nodulose or a geniculate appearance. Usually only one spore is
produced but the scars of 2, 3, or 4 spore-production points are not
infrequent. At the tip of the conidiophore spores also are produced
so that the spores are produced acropleurogenously. The conidio-
phores are smooth to minutely roughened toward the tip.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Buell and Weston 2 reported the use of heavy mineral oil for the
preservation of fungous cultures. The fungi covered by their
report included few Basidiomycetes. Since we had many of this
group in our collection 3 to which the oil method has been applied,
it seems desirable to supplement their results by a report on ours.
For a review of earlier literature and details of the method, the
reader is referred to the article by Buell and Weston.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Beginning March 4, 1947, cultures of 1959 isolations of fungi *
were transferred to 2 per cent malt agar slants. The tubes were
incubated at 25° C. until growth had started (2 days to 1 week)
and were then put at 15° C. until the fungi had grown over the
surface of the slants (about 2 weeks from the time of inocula-
tion). The slants were not left at 25° C. for 2 weeks because.the
agar became too dry. The slants were then covered with sterile
mineral oil. The oil was Parke-Davis heavy mineral oil, and
enough was used in each tube to come about 1 cm. above the top
of the agar slant. After they were oiled, all tubes were placed
in an upright position at 15° C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All the cultures were examined at intervals and the following
observations were made:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some of the fungi grew better under oil. Among these were
species of Corticium, Epidermophyton, Ashbya, Massaria, Melan-
conis, Nyctalis, Elsinoé and Sphaceloma. For example, species
of Melanconis, Elsinoé and Sphaceloma, which formed small
colonies with limited growth on 2 per cent malt agar, covered the
entire slant under oil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Five types of growth under oil were noted. The numbers refer
to the number of isolations in each type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(1) The mycelium grew appressed to the agar slant. None
developed in the oil. (437)#Misc-exposition*]

[@(2) The mycelium grew over the agar slant as in (1) but the
mycelial surface was fuzzy. (524)#Misc-exposition*]

[@(3) The mycelium filled the oil but stopped at the surface of
the oil or a short distance below it. (145)#Misc-exposition*]

[@(4) A band of mycelium ranging in thickness from less than
1 mm. to 10 mm. formed across the tube directly beneath the sur-
face of the oil and above the top of the agar slant. The oil below
this band was free of mycelium. (383)#Misc-exposition*]

[@(5) A narrow band of mycelium (2 mm. or less in thickness)
formed at the top of the slant and hung down over the slant with
varying amounts of oil free of mycelium above and below the
band. (470)#Misc-exposition*]

[@In general, the species of each genus tended to have the same
type of growth. However, there were exceptions, and in some
instances isolations of the same species differed in type of growth.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mycelium of a substantial number (153) of the cultures
eventually grew up out of the oil. In such cultures evidence
of partial drying of the agar slant was observed. The oiled cul-
tures were therefore examined at intervals of six months and ad-
ditional mineral oil added to those in which the mycelium ap-
peared above the oil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pigments from some of the fungi dissolved in the oil. The
colors ranged from tan and light yellow to a medium reddish
purple, deep red or deep yellow. Phlebia strigosozonata and#Misc-exposition*]
[@636 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@species of Elsinoé and Sphaceloma developed pink, orange and red
pigments, yellows were observed for species of Aspergillus, Cor-
ticium, Drosophila, Hydnwm, O xydontia, Poria, Tetracoccosporium
and several others (20 genera in all). The reddish purple color
was found only with cultures of Helminthosporium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some of the fungi did not develop their normal color under oil.
Corticium coeruleum did not form its dark blue pigment, nor did
species of Fusarium or Gibberella become red. Penicillia were
‘white, tan or faint olive-green instead of green or blue-green.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Beginning January 21, 1948, transfers were made from the oiled
cultures. Bits of mycelium were drained as free from oil as
possible by patting them against the inside of the oiled tube and
were transferred to fresh 2 per cent malt agar slants. The slants
were incubated at 25° C. All the fungi were viable except
Pythium butleri, P. helicoides, Peniophora sambuci, two isolations
of Sebacina cinerea and two unidentified species of Sebacina. The
five latter fungi grew poorly and slowly on malt agar before oiling.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In general, it was our impression that the subcultures from the
oiled cultures grew more vigorously than transfers from unoiled
cultures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultures oiled in 1947 were again tested for viability in
January 1949 after two years under oil. Transfers of Ashbya
gossypii and Phallus (Ithyphallus) sp. failed to grow; both had
survived one year under oil. All others grew.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Additional fungi were treated with mineral oil in 1948. Of
these, only five genera—Acanthocystis, Amanita, Armillariella,
Eremothecium and Rhodopaxillus—were not included in the origi-
nalset. All were tested after one year under oil and found to be
viable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cellulose destroying fungi are valued for their part in the process
of reducing plant remains to humus for the enrichment of the soil.
The magnitude of this valuable decomposition process is scarcely
considered by most people because it is so commonplace and pro-
ceeds naturally and continuously. However, these organisms do
not distinguish between waste cellulosic materials and the raw or
fabricated cellulosic goods of value to human needs. In this latter
respect, the destruction of vast quantities of goods by fungi during
the recent war focused the attention of military departments on
the need of finding means of preserving and lengthening the life
and dependability of military equipment. This entailed identify-
ing the organisms concerned as well as prescribing and testing
preservative materials. The efforts to this end have been shared
by the military departments with civilian government. agencies,
commercial research establishments, and college laboratories. Al-
though much progress has been made to prolong the life and de-
pendability of cellulosic materials, only a good start has been made
to solve the many encountered problems. Many people in in-
dustry and government are synthesizing new chemical compounds
designed to treat various goods to prevent mildewing. At the
same time, many independent and cooperative screening tests are
in progress to evaluate old and new fungicides; the more promis-
ing are put through many additional exacting evaluation tests.
Paralleling these researches, the fungi responsible for mildewing
have received considerable attention.#Misc-exposition*]

my deep appreciation. Additional species, discovered by the
writer, were found growing on material and equipment in the
Tropical Testing Chamber, Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The first
fungus belonging to the genus Chaetomium, as now understood,
was described more than 131 years ago.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kunze erected the genus Chaetomium in 1817 based upon the
species C. globosum; a second species, C. elatwm, was published
by him a year later. In 1837 Corda emended Kunze's original
description principally by describing the ostiolum; two new species,
C. indicum and C. murorum, were added to the genus by him at
that time. Descriptions of new species have appeared rather in-
frequently since the erection of the genus, and many of the later
names have been determined subsequently to be synonyms or to
have been erroneously applied. Three small monographic papers
were published by Zopf (1881), Palliser (1910), and Bainier
(1910). These were followed by a much more complete mono-
graphic treatment of the genera Chaetomium and Ascotricha in
1915 by Chivers. In this excellent monograph, of the 114 species
and 14 varieties which were referred to the genus Chaetomium, he
recognized only 28 species, 11 of which he described as new.
Most of the species were beautifully illustrated, thus making identi-
fications relatively easy and accurate. More recently, Tschudy
(1937) described two species, C. ochraceum and C. cancroideum,
which were isolated from decomposing reeds. In 1945 Hughes
described a 4-spored species, C. tetrasporum. In the same year,
Ames described three additional species, C. dolichotrichum, C.
microcephalum, and C. pachypodioides. In a recent paper Skolko
and Groves described two new species, C. erectum and C. veflexwm,
which were isolated from various types of seeds.#Misc-exposition*]

herein described, should be obtained when grown on the medium
and under- the conditions outlined. Some growth characteristics
were observed, during the present study, which were not pre-
viously associated with the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidia have not been authentically described hitherto for
Chaetomium in spite of the fact that two closely related genera,
Chaetomidium and Ascotricha, produce them abundantly. Re-
cently, the writer has observed bulbils produced, in the agar me-
dium, by one species, C. gangligerum, see figure 14. These bodies
have not been fully investigated as yet to determine their reproduc-
tive capacity. A second species, C. seminudum, produces abun-
dant bodies, see figures 28 and 29, borne apically and singly on
slender branches, or occasionally they are of intercalary origin.
These bodies are produced submerged in the agar culture medium
in such numbers that the agar appears cloudy. These chlamy-
dospore-like bodies will be studied more critically and reported on
subsequently.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of the rarer Operculate Discomycetes is Wynnea americana
Thaxter, easily recognizable by the many spoon-shaped apothecia
arising from a fleshy, hypogeous “sclerotium” (FIG. 1), the char-
acteristically striate spores, and the eccentric ascus operculum.
This short note is a report of some collections from New York and
from West Virginia, extending the known range of this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a recent and excellent paper, Le Gal (2) has discussed the
morphology of the ascus tip in this and several other related fungi
which comprise a new group, the Suboperculates, somewhat
intermediate between Operculates and Inoperculates. Her treat-
ment covers representatives of Plectania (sub Sarcoscypha),
Cookeina, Phillipsia, Pithya, Urnula, Rhizopodella (sub Urnula),
Bulgaria (sub Sarcosoma), Pseudoplectania, Melascypha, and
Wynnea. In an earlier paper (3), delayed in publication, she had
united these same genera into the family Sarcoscyphaceae, stress-
ing spore ornamentation. Dr. Le Gal’s disposition of these forms
seems most natural, and the writer’s observations have thus far
been in full accord with hers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wynnea americana is known from several North American
localities, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Ohio, and southern
Pennsylvania (4). More recently it has been reported from ad-
ditional Pennsylvania stations (1, 5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several unrecorded collections extend the northerly range of
this species approximately sixty miles beyond the known limit at
Meadville, Crawford County, Pennsylvania (4). Three collec-
tions made in the Lloyd-Cornell Preserve at Ringwood, New York,
about seven miles east of Ithaca, are the most northerly collections
known to the writer. Two collections from West Virginia,

[@To this list may now be added Cyathus vernicosus DC. This
fungus is of fairly common occurrence in gardens, where it often
grows among dead plant stems or around board edging. In green-
houses it has been found on flats of soil. The species is readily
recognized by its buff-grey color, wide flaring mouth and large
peridioles (FIG. 2). The inside surface of the cup usually has a
shiny or varnished appearance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1920, Dr. Leva Walker (5) published an account of C.
vernicosus mainly from the point of view of the developmental
morphology of the fruit body. It was shown that basidiospores
contain two nuclei and that two nuclei are regularly present in each
cell of the diploid mycelium which bears clamp connections. Since
Miss Walker did not succeed in obtaining a series of monosporous
mycelia, the question of whether the fungus is homothallic or
heterothallic was left unanswered.#Misc-exposition*]

[@By growing diploid mycelium on sterile loam, old leaves and
half-rotten wood, Miss Walker obtained fruit bodies in the labora-
tory and full details of every step in the development of the fruit
bodies and their peridioles were described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first attempt made by the writer to culture this fungus was
in 1941. An abundant supply of fruit bodies was found in a gar-
den in Winnipeg, Canada, where the little cups were growing
around the bases of dead chrysanthemum stalks. Spores from
chopped peridioles were placed in distilled water and in various
nutrient solutions at room temperature. So few spores (1-3%)
germinated in any test that the attempt to obtain a series of mono-
sporous mycelia was abandoned. Several efforts were made sub-
sequently to germinate enough spores for study, but always with
the same unsatisfactory result. Similar difficulty was reported
by Miss Walker (5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@When it had been learned that the basidiospores of Cyathus
stercoreus germinate well after being subjected to a temperature
of 40° C. for 48 hrs.—see Brodie, 1948 (1)—fresh material of
C. vernicosus was sought. The writer is indebted to Mr. Garnet
Best of Winnipeg, Canada, for three fruit bodies collected by him
in that city, Oct. 19, 1947. These specimens provided the single-
spore cultures used in the present investigation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores were not tested for germinability until Nov. 19, 1948,
exactly a year after the fruit bodies had been collected. Peridioles
were cut open under aseptic conditions and spores in a distilled
water suspension were incubated at 40° C. for 48 hours, using
exactly the same technique as has been described by the writer (1)
in his report on C. stercoreus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Plate dilutions were made and single spores cut out under the
microscope. The mycelia that developed were transferred to tube
slants of a special medium compounded as follows: Bacto agar,
20 gm.; maltose, 5 gm.; dextrose, 2 gm.; glycerine, 2 gm.; peptone,
0.2 gm.; asparagine, 0.2 gm.; yeast extract, 2 gm.; magnesium

[@temperature was obtained when the acidity of the medium was
adjusted to pH 6.5.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sixty monospore mycelia were isolated but only twenty-nine of
these were used in the study of pairing reactions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SPORE GERMINATION AND HAPLOID MYCELIA#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basidiospores of C. vernicosus are moderately thin-walled,
colorless and (in the collection referred to above) measure mostly
7X lly. Spores began to germinate 24 hours aíter the heat
treatment, but some germinated tardily a day later. From 40-
60% of the spores germinated in each of the different spore samples.
A single stout germ tube developed from each spore and this
rapidly grew into a haploid mycelium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Haploid mycelia growing on agar plates are fluffy and fine-
textured. Of twenty-nine, selected at random for pairing, only six
showed any tendency to produce the coarse mycelial cords char-
acteristic of the diploid mycelia, the rest remained fine-textured
throughout numerous transfers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Haploid mycelia show only slight morphological differences
when monospore cultures are compared. As to color, they are all
snow-white when freshly transferred and most of them become a
dull ivory color about two weeks later. Four of the series of the
original sixty isolates were buffy brown (Ridgway). No attempt
has been made to study the inheritance of color because the color
differences between haploids are not so striking as they are in
C. stercoreus, nor are the colors so constant from transfer to
transfer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No haploid mycelium has been observed to produce oidia nor to
produce fruit bodies in culture.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PAIRING REACTIONS AND DIPLOID MYCELIUM#Misc-exposition*]

[@Twenty-nine haploid mycelia were paired in all possible com-
binations in the usual way on agar slants. Diploid mycelium be-
gan to develop between certain pairs ten days later. All mycelial
pairs were examined for clamp connections at the end of two
weeks. On the basis of their mating reactions, the haploid my-
celia fell into four mating types with the following distribution:#Misc-exposition*]

[@It would thus appear that Cyathus vernicosus, like all other
members of the Nidulariaceae examined up to the present time, is
heterothallic and tetrapolar. The distribution of haploid mycelia
among the four sex groups is very unequal, similar to the dis-
tribution previously noticed by the writer (1) in C. stercoreus.
From a small number of pairings, this might be considered to have
no special significance. However, Dr. Nils Fries has informed
the writer (by letter) that he attempted an analysis of sexuality of
the European C. olla (Batsch) Pers. (C. vernicosus) and found
that 23 monosporous mycelia fell into four groups in the ratio of
1:11:10:1. Because two groups were represented by only one
mycelium each, Fries did not publish his results. Fries’ finding
furnishes corroboration for the present writer's opinion that this
unequal distribution is a common occurrence and that there is some
factor operative in determining the unequal distribution of mycelia
as to mating type. This may well be similar to what has been
observed in C. stercoreus (1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Diploid mycelia bearing clamp connections are mostly white or
pale ivory in color and are composed of hyphae that are somewhat
coarser than are those of haploid mycelia. The hyphae of the
diploid mycelium tend to become aggregated into loose ropes or
cords, which give to a colony on an agar plate a characteristic
radiate appearance. Some coarse mycelial cords form as colonies
get older, and on these the fruit body rudiments develop. Cords
of this kind are not as abundant on the diploid mycelium of C.
vernicosus as they are on C. stercoreus mycelium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PRODUCTION OF FRUIT BODIES IN CULTURE#Misc-exposition*]

[@mycelia of C. vernicosus to fruit. Even the development of knots
on the mycelium that indicates the beginning of fruit body forma-
tion took place only on three cultures that were six weeks old and
none of the knots continued to grow.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cultures were then transferred to sterilized mixtures of old
leaves, rotting wood, etc., following Miss Walker’s (5) sugges-
tion, but in no instance did fruit bodies appear on any culture al-
though some of these were kept for three months.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally it was decided to resort to the use of soil. Mycelium
(and agar medium) from five slants in flasks, each culture a month
old, was placed in a clean 8 in. flower pot. The culture material
was then covered to a depth of one inch with a sifted sterilized
loam mixture and the soil was pressed down gently.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One week later, mycelial strands appeared on the surface of the
soil and a few fruit body rudiments were visible. By the end of
another week, seventy fruit bodies had developed on the culture,
all of which opened normally in a few days (FIGS. 1, 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Regarding this rapid development of fruit bodies after the addi-
tion of soil, it seems unlikely that the soil could supply any nutri-
tional deficiency which could induce fruiting so soon after applica-
tion. It appears more probable that aeration (texture of the
medium, etc.) was not properly provided by the agar slants but
was provided by the loose covering of soil. To date, several other
cultures of C. vernicosus have been induced to fruit in this way,
but other methods have proven unsuccessful.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although several diploid mycelia, each representing combina-
tions of different haploid mycelia, have been fruited, there is little
variation in the morphology of the fruit bodies: nothing com-
parable to the extreme variability characteristic of C. stercoreus
fruit bodies has been observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most detail concerning the morphology of the fruit bodies is
being reserved for future publication. However, because the
photographs illustrate two noteworthy features of this species, at-
tention may be drawn briefly to these. It is not generally rec-
ognized that fruit bodies of C. vernicosus develop a basal mass of
hyphae (the so-called "emplacement") comparable with the large
and conspicuous ball found at the base of the fruit body of such
species as C. striatus and C. stercoreus. In C. vernicosus this#Misc-exposition*]
[@658 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@emplacement develops early and may be seen as a mycelial mat
around the base of a young fruit body (FIG. 1). As development
proceeds, soil becomes incorporated into the emplacement so that
its size and full extent are appreciated only when soil is lifted from
below the base of the cup.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The epiphragm or covering over the mouth of the unopened
fruit body usually ruptures by an irregular tear across the diame-
ter in C. striatus and C. stercoreus. The epiphragm of all speci-
mens of C. vernicosus developed in the writer's cultures seemed
to rupture in a circumscissile manner, the epiphragm withdrawing
as a shrunken disk to one side of the peridium (FIG. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. Basidiospores of Cyathus vernicosus were germinated one
year after collection by subjecting them to a temperature of 40° C.
for 48 hrs. in distilled water suspension.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. Sixty single-spore mycelia were cultured, of which 29 were
used in a study of heterothallism.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. Single-spore mycelia are haploid. The mycelia are quite
uniformly white and fluffy, an occasional one showing grey-brown
coloration.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. When paired, haploid mycelia fall into four mating-type
groups with uneven distribution of mycelia in the groups. The
fungus is heterothallic and tetrapolar.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. Diploid hyphae bear clamp connections and tend to become
aggregated into cords upon which fruit body rudiments arise.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. Diploid mycelia were induced to fruit only by covering cul-
tures on agar slants with an inch of sterile soil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@7. Each fruit body of C. vernicosus has an “emplacement” or
mass of basal hyphae which becomes compacted into a solid ball
within the soil. This structure is similar to the emplacements of
C. striatus and C. stercoreus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@8. The epiphragm of C. vernicosus ruptures most frequently in a
circumscissile manner and withdraws to one side of the cup as a

[@During the collecting season of 1948, from late June to October,
the University of Michigan maintained a botanical expedition in
Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington. Dr. A. H. Smith who
conducted the survey was assisted by Henry A. Imshaug and
Emory G. Simmons. Dr. D. E. Stuntz of the Department of
Botany, University of Washington, joined the group in July.
They obtained abundant collections of Otidea species which, with
the collections in the University of Michigan Herbarium, form the
basis of this investigation. The writer recognizes ten species and
three varieties. This number materially exceeds the number in
previous published reports for North America. Seaver (1928)
reported three under the name Scodellina. One new species,
O. rainierensis, and one new variety, O. alutacea var. microspora,
are described from the Mt. Rainier collections and one new species,
O. Kauffmanii, is named from Michigan material, The types of
new species described here are deposited in the University Her-
barium of the University of Michigan.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Otidea was established by Fuckel (1869-1870) for
Peziza leporina Pers. ex Fr., P. onotica Fr., P. cochleata L. and
P. abieiina Pers. 'The principal diagnostic character by which
species of Otidea differ from those in Pegiza is the presence of a
split in the apothecium. Fuckel (l.c.) in his diagnosis of the genus
described the paraphyses as “filiform subclavate” although he in-
cluded O. leporina and O. onotica in which the paraphyses are
hooked and not subclavate. Since the genus was established,
several species which have filiform or filiform-subclavate paraph-
yses have been described for it. Boudier (1885) considered the
straight paraphyses as distinctive and established the genus Wyn-
nella based in part on such paraphyses. O. auricula Schaeff. was#Misc-exposition*]

[@made the type of Wynnella. Rehm (1887-1896) reduced this genus
to subgeneric rank. The writer does not regard Wynnella as
sufficiently different from Otidea to consider it as a genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The paraphyses in the two new species described in this paper
exhibit a third type for the genus. In both of these they are
filiform and the apices are expanded into broadly clavate, pyri-
form or globose to subglobose heads. No previously described
species of Ofidea with this type of paraphysis is known to the
writer. O. fibrillosa (Currey) Mass. was so described, but the
fungus is not an Otidea. The spores are described as eguttulate,
and the exterior of the apothecia as tomentose. As illustrated
by Cooke (1879) the apothecia are not split. Our species are
obviously not to be considered O. fibrillosa. Besides the split
apothecia other characters that Otidea species have in common
are: elliptical biguttulate (rarely uniguttulate) spores, absence of
blue coloration in iadine solution, and the prosenchymatic structure
of the hypothecium. The excipular layer shows variation but no
more than might be expected as differences at the species level.
In general this layer is composed of hyphae which are divided into
cells so as to give a pseudoparenchymatic appearance. The cells
are subglobose, hexagonal to long cylindrical, and exhibit many
irregularities of shape and size. This layer may be relatively thick
—up to 300 4, or as narrow as 50y. It is yellowish to. brownish
yellow in color. The transition from the hypothecial layer is
usually gradual but it may be sharply differentiated, as it is in
O. auricula. The outermost layer in some species is fairly even, as
in O. Cantharella v. minor Boud., but in most species the hyphal
ends are gathered up into small pyramidal aggregations frequently
with short protruding chains of from three to six cells. Such
chains are found in connection with the aggregations of hyphae
or they may arise from a surface that does not produce the con-
spicuous bunches of cells. The surface cells are not sufficiently
developed to produce more than a very slight tomentosity on
the cup proper. The basal portion of the cup and the stipe
may be definitely tomentose. In O. auricula as represented in
the North American collection cited in this paper, the outermost
layer is a definite palisade layer of elongate cells rounded at their
apices (FIG. 7). Such a distinct palisade layer has not been found#Misc-exposition*]

[@in other species studied by the author nor has reference to it been
seen in the literature except in Massee’s description of O. neglecta.
The reader is referred to the remarks concerning this situation in
the discussion following O. auricula. In O. grandis and O.
Smithii there exists à condition that is peculiar to these species.
The excipular layer is covered with minute, subglobose granules
golden brown in color. They give the excipular cells a scurfy ap-
pearance and emphasize the brown color, and, in O. grandis, the
mealy texture of the outside of the apothecia. In a water mount
they become detached easily. Boudier (1905-1910) illustrated
them for O. umbrina, but referred to them only in the description
ofthe plate. They were found in all of the collections of O. Smithii
and O. grandis examined by the author.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion: This species is not to be confused with a similar
fungus which is white outside ınstead of brown. Massee has
named the fungus with the white exterior O. neglecta Massee.
The uniform yellowish brown color of the apothecia as observed
in our collection is in accord with the interpretation of O. auricula
sensu Massee. He based his concept of the species in part on the
statement made by Schaeffer (1763) who described and illustrated
a fungus which Massee interpreted as O. auricula. Rehm (1887—
1896), Boudier (1905—1910), and Bresadola apply the specific#Misc-exposition*]

Boudier and Bresadola have illustrated such apothecia. Massee
stated that the hyphal structures of the two species were different;
that the exciple in O. auricula was parenchymatic while in O.
neglecta the outermost cells were arranged parallel. Our North
American collections have the dark color accorded to O. auricula
(Cke.) Massee but have a palisade arrangement of the excipular
layer similar to what Massee (l.c.) reported for O. neglecta.*#Misc-exposition*]

[@His illustration shows the palisade layer to be composed of parallel
chains, which is unlike the palisade in the American specimens of
O. auricula. In view of the condition found in the American
material, one wonders whether or not Massee’s conclusions were
an altogether correct interpretation. The spores as reported in
the literature are given as large, 22-25 X 12-16. The paraph-

[@Discussion: Rehm remarked upon the lack of the green color
in O. grandis. Boudier (1905-1910) and Bresadola (1932) both
illustrate the species as having olive green shades in the exterior
of the cups. Our North American collections as well as the
European collection represented by Sydow, Mycotheca Germanica
No. 2354 lack green color in the dry condition; they are uni-
formly liver brown. While no color notes are available on fresh
material, it is doubtful whether or not any distinct olive green
color was ever present in the outside of the apothecia. The
hymenium (dry) is lighter in color but when soaked in water de-
veloped some shade of orange, frequently a bright orange-red.
The apothecia in our material are all more shallow than indicated
by Boudier’s illustration. In microscopic characters, however,
the specimens conform with Rehm’s description of the species.
The spores are long-elliptical and tend to be narrow at the ends.#Misc-exposition*]
[@KANOUSE: STUDIES IN THE GENUS OTIDEA 673#Misc-exposition*]

[@The outer wall is smooth but in age the inner wall is minutely
roughened. This character is apparent with the aid of an oil im-
mersion lens. The granules on the excipular segments add to the
intensity of the brown color of the outside of the apothecia. They
are readily washed off in a water mount. Boudier (1905-1910)
illustrated them for O. umbrina, but no other investigator seems to
have observed them for they have not been mentioned elsewhere.
They make a useful diagnostic character for these species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion : Ample notes were made by Dr. Kauffman on the
fresh material of the collection which has been designated as the
type. The globose heads of the paraphyses were noted by him in
the fresh material. They are also conspicuous in the dry speci-
mens. Paraphyses of this type were also found in Otidea raini-

[@HABITAT: On ground.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Discussion: Peziza abietina Pers. was transferred to the genus
Otidea by Fuckel. It has since been placed in Aleuria by Gillet
(1879), in Discina by Rehm (1887-1896). Boudier placed it in
his genus Pseudotis, Bresadola (1932) in Otidea, and Seaver
(1928) in Peziza. These interpretations are indicative of the un-
certainty regarding the generic position of the species. The fact
that apothecia are sometimes without a split is probably the reason
for its being assigned to genera other than Oiidea. However,
there is sufficient proof that the split condition is the more com-
mon, and thus it is logical to seek for the species in the genus
Otidea; therefore a description is included here. That there is no
blue coloration in iodine, that the paraphyses are bent, and that
the spores are biguttulate, suggest its affinity with species of Otidea.
It is certain that one would expect to find it listed iri Odea when-
ever cups with true splits were found and the bent paraphyses#Misc-exposition*]
[@676 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@would also suggest this relationship. The under side of the bend
in the paraphyses is ornamented with notches and short prolifera-
tions which give them a distinctive appearance. It is not uncom-
mon to find similar modification in paraphyses in other Otidea
species but never has the author seen them so profuse or so con-
spicuous. The paraphyses project beyond the asci and form loose
tangles’ but are not organized into a definite epithecial layer.
Boudier (1905-1910) and Bresadola (1932) illustrate them, but
the latter's figures show fewer proliferations. The spore size ac-
cording to most authors is reported as large (18-20-26 x 10-12 µm).
Rehm points out that the specimen cited by Fuckel (No. 1226)
which he himself examined is Pezíza badia; that the spores measured
only 14 X 7 µm, and are rough. The notched paraphyses, the lack
of blue coloration and split apothecia were constant in the collec-
tions cited in this study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the course of recent studies on the genus Aplanes, a consider-
able number of soil and water samples have been collected from
various localities in Michigan. From two of these collections,
made in Washtenaw County, a species of Aciilya has been recovered
which differs markedly from any of the hitherto described species
of the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Following recovery from the soil, a single-spore isolate was
grown on cornmeal agar, then transferred to boiled, split hemp-
seed, placed in 30 cubic centimeters of sterile, charcoal-filtered, dis-
tilled water, and kept at a temperature of 22° C. The descrip-
tion of the species was compiled from such cultures. An examina-
tion of the isolate revealed that whereas it resembled, in certain
general features, several of the papillate species of Achlya, it was
actually quite distinct from them. These distinctions are found
in the characteristic coiled, spring-like oogonial stalks, the large
oospores, the variously-shaped oogonia, and in the sparseness of
antheridia. For these reasons, it is considered a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Achlya spiracaulis has been compared with the original descrip-
tions of all known species of Achlya, and although it embodies
characteristics of several of these, it differs from them in one out-
standing respect: 7.e., the production, even under varying environ-
mental conditions, of coiled oogonial stalks. In this feature, the
fungus resembles Achlya contorta Cornu, but from Cornu's in-
complete description and meager illustrations (8), his species pos-
sesses smooth-walled oogonia. On the basis of oospore number,
and unpitted, spiny oogonial wall, there is a resemblance to Achlya
papillosa Humphrey (10). However, the sparingly developed
sporangia, short oogonial stalks, and the abundant though im-
perfectly formed antheridia immediately separate A. papillosa from
the present species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coker (3) reports coiling oogonial stalks for Achlya proliferoides
(3, pl. 36, fig. 6), but because of its smooth oogonial walls, short
oogonial stalks, and abundant antheridia, his species is obviously
not the Michigan isolate. Coiled oogonial stalks were also re-
ported by Coker (3) for Achlya Orion, but these were formed only
at a temperature of 36° C. Further, the smooth-walled oogonia
and the smaller number of larger oospores also distinguish A.
Orion from A. spiracaulis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original description of Achlya recurva by Cornu (8) is
rather vague. A more complete study was made by Latham (11)
of an isolate of A. recurva found in North Carolina. Achlya
spiracaulis evidently resembles Latham’s fungus in certain re-
spects, particularly with reference to the atypical, contorted
oogonia, the size of encysted zoospores, oospore number, and the
scarcity of gemmae. However, because of the coiled oogonial
stalks, larger oogonia, larger oospores, and smaller percentage of
antheridia, A. spiracaulis is distinct from A. recurva.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the exception of Achlya contorta, coiled oogonial stalks
are not reported for any of the European species of Achlya. In
addition, other characteristics of these species, such as oospore size
and number, size of oogonia, and antheridial characteristics, dif-
ferentiate them from A. spiracaulis.#Misc-exposition*]
[@682 Mvycorocia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tt would be repetitious to record details of sporangial formation
and subsequent development and discharge of the zoospores, since,
with the possible exception of basipetalous development of second-
ary sporangia (FIG. 1, D) in older cultures, and germination in
situ in many of these secondary sporangia (FIG. 1, E), the develop-
mental morphology of the sporangia is that characteristic of the
genus Achlya (12). Certain points concerning oogonial develop-
ment in A. spiracaulis should, however, be mentioned. As ob-
setved in young cultures in sterile, charcoal-filtered, distilled wa-
ter, the oogonium first appears as a short, lateral protrusion from
the main hypha (FIG. 1, L). Over a three or four day period fol-
lowing the appearance of the protrusion, there is a marked elonga-
tion into a definite lateral stalk, which, after about three days, be-
gins the characteristic coiling (FIG. 1, M, N). Branching of the
oogonial stalk may occur prior to or immediately after coiling (FIG.
i, K). Upon completion of coiling, the tip of each stalk enlarges,
and one to several spine-like protrusions make their appearance,
which give to the oogonial initial a distinct irregular shape (FIG. 1,
0). The tip continues to enlarge, the spines become more nu-
merous, and ultimately the oogonium reaches mature size. It is
at about this time that antheridia, if any, are formed. The de-
velopment of oospores is slow, even in oogonia which are apparently
fertilized, since in most cases no oospores are visible for six to
eight days after the oogonia reach mature size. Where oogonia
are formed terminally, the first indication of their development is
again coiling of the stalk, in this instance, the hyphal tip. The sub-
sequent development of terminal oogonia is similar to those formed
laterally.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In fifteen- to twenty-day-old cultures, there are occasional in-
stances of oogonia borne on bent or once-coiled stalks (FIG. 2,
G, J). Many of the later-formed stalks do not bear oogonia, and
in still older cultures may give the hyphae a distinctive, short-
branched, bushy or irregular appearance (FIG. 1, P).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Preliminary qualitative studies on the effect of variations in en-
vironments other than pure water on Achlya spiracaulis have been
undertaken. Results would seem to indicate that the distinguishing#Misc-exposition*]

[@coiled-stalk characteristic of the fungus, as well as such features as
origin and size of the oogonia, papillations of the oogonial wall, and
percentage of antheridia, are consistently stable characteristics.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To determine the characteristics of the fungus when grown in a
more natural habitat, a series of 20 single spore isolates were grown
in 20 separate samples of water containing leaves and other debris.
The water and debris samples were selected irom several different
sources such as fresh cold water, stagnant cold water, and warm,
clear, running water. After the colonies had developed for two
weeks in these "natural" habitats, they were observed for possible
changes in morphology. In all of these cultures, the fungus re-
tained the characteristics as described. Of interest, nevertheless,
is the fact that the appearance of oospores in these cultures was re-
markably slow, in most cases not occurring for two to three weeks
after the formation of the oogonia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A more complete study of the effect of varied environments on
the morphology of the fungus is to be undertaken at a future date.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SUMMARY#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new species of Achlya, from Michigan, is described as Achlya
spiracaulis. The fungus is characterized by long, tightly or loosely
coiled oogonial stalks, by which it is easily distinguished from all
other species of Achlya; large, papillate, spherical to irregular
oogonia; large, centric oospores; unpitted oogonial walls, and a
low percentage of about equally diclinous and androgynous an-
theridia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus was grown under several varied environmental con-
ditions (including those simulating natural ones), to induce changes
in the distinguishing morphological characteristics, but the results
of these preliminary studies show that the coiled oogonial stalks,
origin of oogonia, and frequency and type of papillations are con-
sistently stable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@numerous sori of Puccinia malvacearum Mont. to the lid of a petri
dish. Of the many basidiospores of the rust that were projected
downward onto the agar, he observed that the majority showed
only the beginnings of a germination which ended with a sketchy
secondary spore. But among the number some produced a true
mycelium equipped with numerous clamp connections. From the
mycelium there developed sparse aerial hyphae, and from these
were produced long, tapering sterigmata on which were produced
spores having the characteristic form of basidiospores. These
were projected at maturity and continued the same cycle of devel-
opment. The spores of this fungus were nearly the same size as
those of Puccinia malvacearum so unless permitted to grow could
not easily be distinguished from them. Derx (3) figures enlarged
swollen cells with thin cell walls, each provided with a clamp at its
base, on the mycelium of Jtersonilic. He aptly calls his new spe-
cies J. perplexans. Because his descriptions occur in a somewhat
obscure journal they are repeated here for convenience (3).#Misc-exposition*]

young, hyaline chlamydospores and not rounded up ballistospores

fixed by exposing it to fumes of osmic acid in Fleming’s weaker

[@When ballistospores germinate on slides that have been coated
with Mayer's adhesive, they produce long germ tubes, usually un-
branched, each with a swollen spear-point vesicle at the tip. The
two nuclei in each ballistospore migrate through the germ tube into
the vesicle (FIc.6, E). Sometimes the germ tube continues vege-
tative growth but in other cases a secondary ballistospore is formed
at the pointed tip of the vesicle (FIG. 6, F) and this spore receives
the entire contents of the germ tube, including the two nuclei. Di-
rect production of ballistospores is relatively uncommon on slides
containing Mayer's adhesive.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When ballistospores germinate on water agar, either secondary
ballistospores are formed directly from the primary ballistospores
on short sterigmata, as in Sporobolomyces and Sporidiobolus John-
sonii, or germ tubes are produced that penetrate downward into the
agar. The protoplasm of the germ tube migrates and remains at
the growing tip, resulting in complete evacuation of the spore and
most of the germ tube. Crosswalls are laid down immediately be-
hind the migrating protoplasm. No clamp connections have been
observed under these conditions. On nutrient agar there may be
some protoplasmic migration in the germ tube but the tube soon
branches and produces a normal mycelium with clamp connections.
Germination of the chlamydospores of this species was not observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cytology. The ballistospores of this species are binucleate in
contrast to those of Sporidiobolus Johnsonii and those of species of
Sporobolomyces (v1Gc. 6, D). Upon germination on nutrient agar
they give rise to binucleate mycelia. The nuclei are usually closely
associated in the mycelial cells. As far as could be determined the
chlamydospores (FIG. 6, G) at maturity are uninucleate, probably
containing a diploid fusion nucleus. Considerable difficulty was ex-
perienced in getting good preparations of stained chlamydospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@When young cultures of Sporidiobolus Johnsonii are observed
before mycelial production begins, they cannot be distinguished
from some species of Sporobolomyces. The masses of ballisto-
spores are pink in color; yeast-like cells are formed and bud ex-
actly as they do in Sporobolomyces. Also, the production of bal-#Misc-exposition*]
[@NYLAND: UNUSUAL HETEROBASIDIOMYCETES 699#Misc-exposition*]

[@listospores by repetition occurs in the same manner as in Sporobolo-
myces. Single spore cultures were used throughout so there is no
question of culture purity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ballistospores of Itersonilia pyriformis do not exhibit the
yeast-like budding nor do they have the pink color of those of
Sporidiobolus Johnsonit. Also the ballistospores of I. pyriformis
are larger than those of S. Johnsonii. There is considerable dif-
ference in the appearance of the colonies of these two fungi when
grown on the same medium. S. Johnsonii produces an appressed
growth with very few aerial hyphae. Also, the colony has a brown-
ish cast due to the masses of brown-walled chlamydospores formed.
Itersonilia pyriformis, in contrast, produces a luxuriant aerial
growth, very white and cottony, at least in young cultures. The
chlamydospores formed are thin-walled and hyaline. No clamp
connections have been observed in association with the chlamydo-
spores in this species,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Itersonilia perplexans Derx is reported (3) to produce “in-
flated bodies" having clamp connections associated with them.
No doubt these inflated bodies, which may be terminal or inter-
calaty, are comparable to the chlamydospores of Sporidiobolus John-
sonii and I. pyriformis. In S. Johnsonii the chlamydospores are
thick-walled and brown, being definitely resting spores, whereas, in
I. pyriformis and I. perplexans Derx, they are thin-walled and hya-
line. According to Derx (3), there is always a clamp connection
associated with the chlamydospore of J. perplexans. This is also
true of S. Johnsonis but not of I. pyriformis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The writer is in agreement with Derx (3) that Stempell (7)
probably had a species of Itersonilia in culture rather than Enty-
loma calendulae when he described his "Mycel II" and “Halb-
mondkonidien."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Derx (3) has amended the description of the family Sporobolo-
mycetaceae to include the genera Tilletiopsis and Itersonilia. The
genus Sporidiobolus, however, has characters that exclude it from
the Sporobolomycetaceae. The presence of chlamydospores in
which two nuclei fuse would appear to constitute a sexual phase
on the order of that occurring in the smuts. Martin (5) considers
the family Sporobolomycetaceae as being composed of imperfect#Misc-exposition*]
[@700 Mycologia, Vol. 41, 1949#Misc-exposition*]

[@fungi and consequently classifies it among the Fungi Imperfecti.
Sporidiobolus with its apparent sexual stage could not, therefore,
be placed in this family.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the genus description of Tilletiopsis, provisionally proposed
by Derx (2) in 1930 and accepted by him in 1948 (3), no mention
is made of chlamydospores or of a sexual stage. However, the
writer has isolated two species of Tilletiopsis® which produce
chlamydospores that are strikingly similar to those found in the
genus Entyloma. There is a good possibility that, when the
chlamydospores of these two species are studied cytologically, a
sexual phase similar to that in Sporidiobolus will be revealed. Pre-
liminary work to date has suggested that such will be the case. If
so, Tilletiopsis could not logically be included in the Sporobolo-
mycetaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As indicated above, the chlamydospores of Itersonilia pyriformis
contain a single nucleus. The hyphal cells of this fungus are typi-
cally binucleate. If further cytological study reveals that the young
chlamydospores are binucleate, a sexual stage such as occurs in
Sporidiobolus would be demonstrated. In that case, neither Til-
letiopsis nor Itersonilia could be included in the family Sporobolo-
mycetaceae as it now stands.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For these reasons, it is considered premature to include the
genera Tilletiopsis and Itersonilia in the family Sporobolomyceta-
ceae of the Fungi Imperfecti as Derx (3) has proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES AND BRIEF ARTICLES#Misc-exposition*]

[@TAPHRINA LATA Palm#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the writer's recent monograph (Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull. 33:
3-167. 1949) it is stated regarding certain specimens (in the
Stockholm Museum) collected by Palm at Tungelsta, Sweden: “It
seems highly probable that this is the material Palm used in de-
scribing Taphrina lata.” This fungus is then reduced to synonymy
as Taphrina carnea Johanson.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. J. A. Nannfeldt has kindly pointed out the probability of er-
ror in this treatment of T. lata. A reexamination of the material
and of the writer’s notes makes it clear that the specimens in ques-
tion must have been those collected by Palm at Tungelsta and
called by him (Arkiv. £. Bot. 15 (4): 1-4. 1917) Taphrina janus.
(T. janus is, by the writer's treatment, synonymous with T. carnea.)
It could not by any possibility be the type material of T. lata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A further error is the writer’s report (I.c.) that Palm described
T. lata as *. . . affecting only young seedlings a foot or less tall."
No such statement occurs in Palm's paper (1lc.). Palm described
Taphrina lata as affecting individual shoots of Betula pubescens
Ehrh., causing lateral enlargement and slight thickening of leaves,
and enlargement of twigs. He distinguished it further by its broad
asci: asci 4045 4x 18-22 µm; stalk cells 16-20 µm x 25-33 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taphrina lata Palm must be reconstituted as a valid species.
Any doubts about it can only be resolved by finding the type ma-
terial or by collection of material from the type locality.—A. J. Mıx,
Dept. of Botany, Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A Note on INONOTUS AMPLECTENS MURRILL#Misc-exposition*]

[@This very interesting fungus was found and described by William
A. Murrill growing on living twigs of Asimina in Georgia. On
July 28, 1949, Mr. Thomas J. Wesson, Jr., on a field trip found
this form growing on the twigs of Asimina parviflora (Michx.)
Dunal and brought it to the writer who sent it to Dr. J. N. Couch
for identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@702#Misc-exposition*]
[@Notes AND BRIEF ARTICLES 703#Misc-exposition*]

[@On checking the location, this author found this fungus growing
on the small papaw along the banks of the Ochlockonee River in
Leon county, Florida. The papaws were scattered for 350 feet
along the sides of a trail through the dense woods. The fungus
occurred on approximately two-thirds of the scattered plants noted.
There were 1-4 fruiting bodies per plant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a measured space, 15 by 24 feet, 25 knee-high shrubs were
counted with an average of 2 thalli per plant. In a second meas-
ured area, 15 by 15 feet, 12 waist high papaws were counted with
2-3 fungi per plant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Inonotus amplectens Murrill usually occurs in the fork of two
branches and is attached to both adjacent branches, or to a branch
and a leaf petiole. Only occasionally have we found it attached
directly to the main stem. Pore surfaces are always oriented so
that they project towards the ground. The area of the stem
directly under the points of attachment is usually darkened con-
siderably.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems to be quite unusual for this fungus to occur in such
large quantities. Dr. Herman Kurz who has been collecting in this
area for 20 years reports that he has never observed this fungus
before this year.—A. W. ZIEGLER, Dept. of Botany, Florida State
University.#Misc-exposition*]
