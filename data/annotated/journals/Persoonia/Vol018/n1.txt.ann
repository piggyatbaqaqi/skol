[@CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A MONOGRAPH OF PHOMA
(COELOMYCETES) VI - 2
Section Phyllostictoides: Outline of its taxa#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. DE GRUYTER', G.H. BOEREMA? & H.A. VAN DER AA?#Author*]

[@Thirty taxa in Phoma sect. Phyllostictoides, characterised by secondary septation
of a variable number of conidia, are described in vitro. Two Phyllostictoides-like
species are (re)classified in sect. Sclerophomella on account of certain pycnidial
characteristics. Short notes on the ecology and distribution are added. Newly
proposed taxa are: Phoma acetosellae (A.L. Sm. & Ramsb.) Aa & Boerema comb.
nov., Phoma argillacea (Bres.) Aa & Boerema comb. nov. (teleomorph Didymella
applanata (Niessl) Sace.), Phoma nepeticola (Melnik) Dorenb. & de Gruyter comb.
nov. (teleomorph Didymella catariae (Cooke & Ellis) Sacc.), Phoma destructiva
var. diversispora de Gruyter & Boerema var, nov., Phoma heliopsidis (H.C. Greene)
Aa & Boerema comb. nov., Phoma laundoniae Boerema & De Gruyter spec. nov.
and Phoma rhei (Ellis & Everh.) Aa & Boerema comb. nov. A key is given to the
cultural characteristics of all species and varieties at present recognised within the
section (including the two Phywllostictoides-like species of Sclerophomella), as
well as indices on host-fungus and fungus-host relations.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Contribution VI-1 (Van der Aa et al., 2001) the characteristics, nomenclature and
synonymy of Phoma exigua Desm., the type species of Phoma sect. Phyllostictoides
Zherbele ex Boerema (Boerema, 1997), have been discussed. The present concept of
that species separates a number of host-specific varieties, but P. exigua var. exigua is
a plurivorous, cosmopolitan wound and weakly parasitic fungus, which has been
isolated from more than 200 host genera in Eurasia. Its morphological variability clearly
illustrates the various characters of the section PAyllostictoides: pycnidia thin-walled,
pseudoparenchymatous, glabrous, but sometimes with hyphal outgrowths, usually with
a predetermined opening or ostiole, but sometimes remaining closed for a long time
before final formation of a pore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidia have a broad range of shapes and dimensions and are mainly aseptate
in vitro, but in vivo the larger conidia often become two or even more celled by second-
ary septation. The percentage of septate conidia depends on environmental conditions
and may vary in vivo between 5 and 95%. Under normal laboratory conditions the
majority of conidia always remain one-celled, but some larger conidia usually become
septate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Apart from the type of substrate, humidity and desiccation, temperature may greatly
influence conidial characters of these Phoma species in vivo (see the discussions under
Phoma ligulicola Boerema var. ligulicola (no. 5a) and Phoma medicaginis var. macro-
spora Boerema, Pieters & Hamers (no. 7b)).#Misc-exposition*]

[@PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name of the section Phyllostictoides is in line with the occurrence of many
species in association with leaf spots and leaf necroses. Conform to the Saccardoan
system for anamorph genera, most collections of these species were formerly arranged
under 'PAyllosticta'. The frequent occurrence of two-celled conidia in vivo explains
why specimens on leaves were also classified in 'AscocAyta', and in 'Diplodina' when
associated with stems.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The section includes species with and without chlamydospores; if present they are
unicellular, solitary or formed in series or complexes. Various species of this section
are anamorphs of species of Didymella Sacc. ex Sacc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present paper, thirty taxa classified in section Phyllostictoides are described
according to their characteristics in vitro, with notes on ecology and distribution. On
account of their pycnidial characteristics two species, initially also included in sect.
Phyllostictoides, are now classified in sect. Sclerophomella (Boerema & de Gruyter,
1998) and treated in an Appendix. A key and indices to host-fungus and fungus-host
relationships of all taxa of the section (thus including the varieties of P. exigua) are
provided. The key also includes the two species of sect. Sclerophomella in the Appen-
dix. In the same way the sections Phoma, Peyronellaea, Plenodomus, Heterospora,
Sclerophomella (documentation in the introduction of Contribution VI-1, Van der Aa
et al., l.c.) and Paraphoma (De Gruyter & Boerema, 2002) have earlier been treated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates and herbarium specimens were studied as described in Contributions
I-1 and I-2 of this series (de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992; De Gruyter et al., 1993).
Additional information on terminology (indication of colours, colony outline and mean
diameter after 7 days, Q or length-width ratio) is given in Contribution VII (Boerema
& de Gruyter, 1998). The isolates studied are currently kept in the culture collections
of CBS, Utrecht (formerly Baarn) and the Plant Protection Service, PD, Wageningen.

[@Ecology and distribution. A common pathogen of Nepeta cataria, a medicinal herb
(catmint) indigenous to the eastern Mediterranean, but becoming naturalized through-
out Europe, and also known in North America. The fungus is also recorded on other
species of Nepeta, and apparently widely distributed in Eurasia and North America
(Canada, USA). According to the 'Ascochyta monography' by Melnik (1977) the fun-
gus should also affect other Labiatae, such as Leonurus cardiaca and Mentha spp.
This is quite plausible, but still needs to be confirmed by pathogenicity tests. Melnik
listed the anamorph under Ascochyta leonuri Ellis & Dearn., as distinct from Phoma

[@Ecology and distribution. A specific pathogen of florists’ chrysanthemum, Dendran-
thema-Grandiflorum hybrids (formerly known as e.g. Chrysanthemum morifolium and
C. indicum). At present, this pathogen occurs nearly everywhere the host is cultivated.
The fungus seems to be indigenous to Japan, but was first recorded in the south-eastern
United States as the cause of Chrysanthemum Ray (flower) Blight. It may attack all
plant parts, roots, stems, leaves and flowers. Cuttings are particularly susceptible; hence
the rapid world-wide spread of the fungus since the late 1940s. The suggestion that
the disease was present in Europe before the first observations were made in the United
States, appeared to be due to confusion with a different teleomorph described in Italy
(Mycosphaerella chrysanthemi (Tassi) Tomilin, see Walker & Baker, 1983) and the
existence of a related fungus, occurring on various other wild and cultivated Compo-
sitae [distinguished as P ligulicola var. inoxydabilis Boerema, listed below, c. g. charac-

[@Ecology and distribution. This fungus has been found in Europe and Australia, but
probably also occurs elsewhere on wild and cultivated Compositae. The various isolates
studied were obtained from Tanacetum (Chrysanthemum/Pyrethrum) cinerariifolium,
feverfew, Tanacetum (Chrysanthemum/Pyrethrum) parthenium and zinnia, Zinnia
violacea (elegans). In fresh cultures on agar media it produces both the anamorph and
teleomorph, which morphologically agree with those of Phoma/Didymella ligulicola.
However, apart from the frequent production of the teleomorph in vitro, it differs by
the absence of antibiotic E (therefore, no discolouration with addition of a drop of
NaOH, no oxidation-reaction: hence ‘inoxydabilis’ ), a slower growth-rate, no produc-
tion of a diffusable pigment, and less conidial variability. It is plausible that Phoma
chrysanthemi Voglino, described in Italy, refers to this variety and not to var. ligulicola
which reached Europe only in the late 1940s.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Description in vitro#Description*]

[@The general characters of this variety in vitro are similar to those of Phoma macro-
stoma var. macrostoma. The differentiation in vitro is based on the absence of the red-
violet pigment in the cytoplasm and guttules of the hyphal cells. As a result, the colony
on OA is colourless. However, pale grey olivaceous/dull green sectors in a stellate
pattern may occur. The conidial exudate is white to buff/rosy buff. The NaOH spot
test is negative. On MA the colony is primrose/olivaceous buff, often with pale honey
olivaceous sectors. On CA the general colony colour is colourless to pale greenish oliva-
ceous/olivaceous in a stellate pattern.#Description*]

[@Ecology and distribution. This cultural variety often occurs as a colourless sector
(saltant) in the red-violet coloured colonies of the type variety. The absence of pigment

[@Description in vitro#Description*]

[@A detailed description of morphology in vitro has been given in a provisional treat-
ment dealing with Phoma species producing dendritic crystals (Noordeloos et al., 1993).
Distinctive are the white, bryoid, dendritic crystals, consisting of brefeldin A, produced
on malt agar after 7 days. Chlamydospores are occasionally produced in old cultures.
The growth-rate on OA and MA is moderate, 35—45 mm after 7 days. Conidia are
unicellular, rarely 1-septate, S—7(—12.5) x 1.5—4 µm, subcylindrical, Q = 1.5-3.5. The
type variety of P. medicaginis does not produce any septate conidia in vivo. At low
temperatures this absence of septate conidia is the most conspicuous character dis-
tinguishing it from var. macrospora (no. 7b), which may produce 10-63% relatively
large septate conidia in winter (Róssner, 1968). Both varieties also differ in patho-
genicity.#Description*]

[@Ecology and distribution. The type variety of P. medicaginis is a cosmopolitan seed-
borne pathogen of lucerne, Medicago sativa: Black Stem Disease. However, this disease
is also caused by the more pathogenic P. medicaginis var. macrospora Boerema, Pieters
& Hamers (no. 7b), which can not be distinguished from var. medicaginis on agar
media at room temperature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phoma medicaginis var. medicaginis may also attack other Leguminosae such as

[@Characteristics in vitro#Description*]

[@On agar media at room temperature the mainly aseptate conidia of P. medicaginis
var. macrospora are not essentially larger then those of the type variety medicaginis.
The varietal epithet macrospora refers to the relatively large 1—3-septate conidia (up
to 28 x 6 µm; 'ascochytoid' as in sect. Heterospora: Boerema et al., 1997), which may
be produced in large quantities (up to 6356) at low temperatures, i.e. under winter
conditions (Róssner, 1968). At low temperatures the type variety usually only produces
the smaller aseptate conidia. These differences in conidial dimensions and septation
at low temperature arc also associated with differences in pathogenicity (see below).#Description*]

[@Ecology and distribution. Phoma medicaginis var. macrospora appears to be a
relatively strong pathogen of lucerne, Medicago sativa, its principal host. It commonly
occurs in Eurasia, but is particularly widely distributed in North America (United States
and Canada): Spring Black Stem of alfalfa (lucerne). The variety probably originates
from the cold mountainous regions in South-West Asia. The fact that only cold-resistant
varieties of lucerne (blue alfalfa) are generally grown in North America may explain
why var. macrospora appears to be so widely distributed in North America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution. This newly recognised variety of Phoma destructiva
Plowr.? demonstrates the close relationship between sections Phoma and Phyllostictoi-
des. Typical isolates of P. destructiva var. destructiva [fruit rot and foliar lesions of
tomato and pepper (paprika); apparently common in (sub-)tropical regions and probably
of American origin] produce pycnidia with only aseptate conidia and therefore must
be classified in sect. Poma. Although similar in cultural characters, isolates of P. des-
tructiva var. diversispora always produce in addition to aseptate conidia a number of
somewhat larger, 1-septate conidia, characteristic of sect. Phyllostictioides. The sub-
specific classification is supported by AFLP studies (Abeln et al., 2002). The type-
strain of P. destructiva var. diversispora, CBS 162.78, was genetically different from
two typical strains of var. destructiva, CBS 378.73 and CBS 133.93, but they all clearly
belonged to one cluster.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since 1977 var. diversispora has been frequently recorded on tomato crops in glass-
houses in the Netherlands (comp. Boerema & van Kesteren, 1980). It causes light brown
necroses on leaves, leaf stalks and stems, with dark pycnidia often in concentric rings:
Necrotic Spot. It may also cause Fruit Rot.#Misc-exposition*]

ent, mature pycnidial conidia are always septate (ascochytoid) and ascomata of the
teleomorph usually also develop in fresh cultures. Both fungi are probably related
(Boerema et al., 1993). In this context it is very notable that the asci and ascospores

especially cucumber, Cucumis sativus, melon and muskmelon, varieties of Cucumis
melo, pumpkin and courgette, varieties of Cucurbita pepo, and water melon, Citrullus
vulgaris. The disease, known as Gummy Stem Blight, includes a variety of symptoms
which are referred to as leaf spot, stem canker, vine wilt and black fruit rot. The name
of the disease refers to the gummy exudate on stem and fruit lesions. The cosmopolitan
distribution of the fungus may explain the recorded variation in pathogenicity and the
extreme conidial variability of the anamorph in vivo. This extreme variability could
also explain why the pycnidia of Phoma cucurbitacearum have often been confused
with those of saprophytic species of Phoma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book gives an account of the macrofungi found in the coastal sand dunes along
the Tyrenean Sea in the vicinity of Pisa (Italy). This region, the National Park of Miglia-
rino San Rossore Massacuiccoli, consists of dunes with a variety of vegetation, from
shifting sands with pioneer vegetation, such as Cakilo-Xanthietum italici, Sporobolo-
Agropyretum juncei and Echinophoro-Ammophiletum arenaria, to fixed dunes with
various wood types, mainly consisting of typical Mediterranean trees and shrubs like
Pinus pinaster, Cistus creticus, Arbutus unedo and Juniperus oxycedrus. After a short
introduction on landscape, vegetation and fungal ecology, the book gives a taxonomic
account of the macrofungi found in this area. Many species are fully described and
illustrated with good colour photographs and line-drawings of microscopical characters.
As such this publication is an excellent guide to the fungi of Mediterranean dune eco-
systems, and also enables comparison with similar ecosystems in the temperate Atlantic
regions of Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON PLEUROTUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@EDGARDO O. ALBERTÖ!, RONALD H. PETERSEN?, KAREN W. HUGHES? &
BERNARDO LECHNER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The paper takes up four points: 1) A previously unnamed intersterility group in
Pleurotus (ISG XIII) has been identified as P. albidus, which fruits from Central
America to central Argentina. The species is genetically isolated and phylo-
genetically it is placed in the ‘P. ostreatus’ group of monomitic Pleurotus basidio-
mata. 2) The distributional range of P. abieticola is extended to far northwestern
Russia and northern China. 3) A partial nomenclator is furnished for P. djamor
4) The use of the term ‘dimitic’ is discussed as it pertains to Pleurotus.#Abstract*]

[@The past decade or more has seen an increase in systematic research on Pleurotus (*oys-
ter mushrooms’ ). In taxonomy, there has been an effort to circumscribe the infrageneric
taxa morphologically (Hilber, 1982, 1997; Zervakis & Balis, 1991; Vilgalys et al., 1993;
Petersen & Krisai-Greilhuber, 1996, 1999; Petersen & Hughes, 1997), to extend infor-
mative taxonomic characters to mating patterns (Vilgalys et al., 1993; Petersen &
Hughes, 1993; Petersen, 1995a, b; Zervakis, 1998), physiology (Zervakis & Balis,
1991, 1992, 1996) and enzyme patterns (Zervakis & Labarére, 1992), and to reconstruct
the phylogeny of the genus (Vilgalys & Sun, 1994; Zervakis et al., 1994; Vilgalys et
al., 1996; Gonzalez & Labarére, 2000; Thorn et al., 2000; Montcalvo et al., 2000). As
this research has emerged, the stringency of proposing new taxa has also increased,
so the standard now assumed is that proposal of a new species name should be accom-
panied by data on its genetic isolation and phylogenetic placement.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As pointed out elsewhere (Petersen & Hughes, 1998), there are at least three means
through which collections (= basidiomata and/or cultures) can be judged contaxic or
segregated as separate taxonomic entities: 1) morphological similarity /dissimilarity,
usually as judged through basidiomata; 2) ability or potential ability to interbreed,
requiring gametic (= haploid, monokaryon) isolates with which to conduct crossing
experiments; and 3) placement on a phylogenetic reconstruction, requiring data (phenet-
ic or molecular) from other congeneric taxa for comparative purposes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTERSTERILITY GROUP XIII IS PLEUROTUS ALBIDUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Vilgalys & Sun (1994) initiated a system of numbering intersterility groups (ISGs)
in Pleurotus in the same way that Armillaria ISGs had been numbered previously
(Anderson & Ullrich, 1979). In the first such enumeration, eight ISGs were identified
in Pleurotus, but later (Vilgalys et al., 1996), 15 were listed in a phylogenetic recon-#Misc-exposition*]

represented a new species of Pleurotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological analyses#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomata of Argentine collections were examined by RHP and EA separately,
while those of 9498 and 10056 were examined by RHP. Macromorphological notes
were taken on relevant type specimens by RHP. Micromorphological analyses and
measurements of various structures were conducted using standard procedures (i.e.
thin-sections of pileipellis, pileus trama and lamellae; squash mounts of lamellae using
either bright field microscopy with or without aqueous phloxine or phase contrast
microscopy without stain).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA was extracted from monokaryon cultures as described by Hughes et al. (1999).
The ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 was amplified with primers ITSS and ITS4 using 1 jd
extracted DNA in a 50 ul reaction mixture. PCR parameters were 3 mins at 94 °C
followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 52 °C and 1 min at 72 °C. The final
extension was 3 mins at 72 °C. PCR products were purified with a Wizard PCR purifica-
tion system (Promega), following manufacturer's directions. Both strands of the PCR
product were reamplified for cycle sequencing using ITS2, ITS3, ITS4 and ITS5 prim-
ers (White et al., 1990). Products were sequenced using ABI automated sequencing
systems at the University of Tennessee Sequencing Facility. Sequences were edited
using the Genetics Computer Group Sequence Analysis Software Package gap and
line-up programs (GCG 2000) and deposited with GenBank (see Fig. 3). Sequences
were aligned using the GCG Seglab program and adjusted manually. Regions of homol-
ogy to the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) 18S gene to the Heterobasidion annosum
5.8S gene and to the yeast 25S gene were determined by sequence comparison. Pleuro-
tus ITS1 and ITS2 sequences (Vilgalys & Sun, 1994) were retrieved from GenBank.
For each collection, ITS 1 sequences were reversed and complemented and appended
to ITS2 sequences for the same collection with a gap representing a section of the
5.8S gene that was not sequenced in those studies. Vilgalys furnished an ITS sequence
for strain D 327, the basis for ISG XIII (Vilgalys et al., 1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic relationships were computed using PAUP 4.0 using a branch and bound
search option. Node support was estimated from 100 bootstrapped replicates. There
were few gaps and they were treated as a fifth base. Pleurotus cystidiosus and P. dryinus
were used as outgroups based on studies showing that these species were basal to the
monomitic Pleurotus clade (Vilgalys & Sun, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

were paired with SBIs of P. djamor (strain 6346, see Petersen, 1995b). AII such pairings

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three subtle morphological taxonomic characters seem to segregate one taxonomic
complex within Pleurotus: 1) monomitic hyphal construction of basidiomata; 2) small
size of microdroplets in culture; and 3) production of microdroplets on aerial hyphae
(rather than from hyphae on the agar surface) in culture. This complex appears to be
congruent with what Vilgalys has called the ‘P. ostreatus clade’(Vilgalys et al., 1993,
1996; Vilgalys & Sun, 1994; Vilgalys, 1997; Thorn et al., 2000). Within this complex,
basidiomata of P. ostreatus, P. pulmonarius, P. abieticola, and P. populinus share a
‘pleurotoid’ stature (i.e. more or less shelf-like; radically eccentrically stipitate).
Basidiomata of P. eryngii are centrally to eccentrically stipitate, but the species appears
unique also as a root parasite of plants in the Umbelliferae. Thus, while it is not
unprecedented to find omphalioid or clitocyboid stature within the complex,
basidiomata of P. albidus are deeply infundibuliform and occur on wood, while those
of P. eryngii are planar to slightly depressed, and appear to be root parasites with
basidiomata produced through soil. Thus, P. albidus basidiomata are unique to the
‘ostreatus Clade’ (Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have found additional records of Spegazzini specimens listed under P. laciniato-
crenatus, and have examined the pertinent specimens. Data are as follows: 1) LPS#Misc-exposition*]
[@Albertó, Petersen, Hughes & Lechner: Notes on Pleurotus 63#Page-header*]

[@17060 (Uruguay, Montevideo, V. 1914), a monomitic stipitate Pleurotus, probably cor-
rectly identified by Spegazzini; 2) LPS 17061 (Argentina, Tucuman, VII. 1918), almost
destroyed by insects and now unidentifiable; 3) LPS 17062 (Argentina, La Plata,
1V.1919), a monomitic Pleurotus with several spore types, one of which gives dimen-
sions as 8-12 x 3—4 µm, probably correctly identified by Spegazzini; 4) LPS 17074
(Paraguay, Villa Moira, 1893), a marasmielloid, laterally stipitate fungus, similar to
Neonothopanus nambi; and 5) LPS 17099 (Paraguay, Garapeguá, 28.V1.1883), dimi-
diate, imbricate pleurotoid basidiomata with lobed, fimbriate margin, perhaps Pleurotus
djamor.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No more recent reports (i.e. notes with herbarium specimens used in this study) of
pinkish colouration of lamellae have been seen since Spegazzini’s initial proposal of
the species epithet. Such colouration is common in P. djamor (see Corner, 1981; Peter-
sen, 1995a; Nicholl & Petersen, 2000), but Spegazzini’s mention represents the only
such report for the ‘ostreatus clade’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the process of separating basidiomata of Pleurotus trom those of other super-
ficially similar taxa (i.e. Panus), it is partially diagnostic to observe mucronate cheilo-
cystidia (with a capitula of resinous liquid when fresh) or occasionally such pileicysti-
dia. These have not been seen on these cornucopioid basidiomata. The condition of
the relevant type specimens was relatively poor except for that of Pleurotus laciniato-
crenatus. In all cases (including type specimens), pilei were thin, infundibuliform, and
stipes were central to somewhat eccentric. Argentine strains Ed 519 (BAFC 50.261)
and Ed 772 (BAFC 50.047) were fruited at Tennessee on Liriodendron sawdust blocks
and Ed 808 (BAFC 2787) was fruited in Argentina on sawdust, and all produced similar
basidiomata (Figs. 4 & 5). Although all such basidiomata were smaller than those from
nature, all other morphological characters matched those of natural basidiomata, includ-
ing both lacerate-crenate and entire pileus margin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Singer (1950), although in a paper purporting to report on type specimens, apparently
reported on his own fresh collections identified as Pleurotus laciniato-crenatus, and
redescribed the taxon. He judged that "Although this species belongs in the Pleurorus-
ostreatus-complex, I believe it to be an outstanding form of the latter." Singer's con-
clusion was correct, for although Pleurotus ostreatus exhibits a rather different habit
(i.e. shelf-like, imbricate — in short, *pleurotoid"), it is also monomitic. This conclusion
is even more surprising, for Singer's experience with Pleurotus was marginal, espe-
cially in South America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Horak (1968: 681) compared the type specimen of Pleurotus laciniato-crenatus to
P. eugrammus. Although basidiome habit was decidedly different, he found micro-
morphology to be ‘identisch’. Petersen & Krisai-Greilhuber (1999) redescribed
P. eugrammus from type material, noting that hyphal construction was dimitic, this
contrary to Horak’s comparison of micromorphology. Petersen (below) has questioned
the use of the term dimitic in Pleurotus, but the meaning of the term as applied to
Pleurotus remains clear.#Misc-exposition*]

[@collections were unique morphologically, genetically isolated (i.e. interINcompatible
with a battery of other Pleurotus taxa) and ITS sequences formed an independent clade
within the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Now, three more collections can be reported which greatly extend the known distri-
bution of the species. Two collections were made some years prior to description of
P. abieticola, and were ‘discovered’ during an attempt to identify all collections of
Pleurotus at TENN. From northern Jilin Province, China, basidiomata formed on coni-
fer logs. The other collection was made in far northwestern Russia, north of St.
Petersburg. Substratum was thought to be Salix or Alnus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All three collections were intercompatible with the original two collections, but
were interINcompatible with all other Pleurotus taxa. ITS sequences of collection
10625 also places this collection within the same clade as the original material (Fig.

[@NOTES ON MITICITY IN PLEUROTUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Corner (1932a, b) developed terms and definitions dealing with hyphal construction
in polyporoid fungi and elaborated on these concepts in the clavarioid fungi (Corner,
1950). In 1953, Corner recapitulated definitions formulated in 1932, and defined a
skeletal hypha as follows: “... unbranched, thick-walled, commonly aseptate, longi-
tudinal, constructional hyphae of the first order in the growing region.” Likewise, Cor-
ner (1953) circumscribed generative hyphae as follows: “The thin-walled hyphae usu-
ally remain thin-walled and are very inconspicuous for this reason ... or parts of them
become thick-walled and mistakable for skeletal or binding hyphae ... Because they
produce the system of skeletal hyphae ... and the system of binding hyphae ... I called
them generative hyphae.” [Italics ours]. Specifically, when only one hyphal type was
present in basidiome tissues, those tissues were termed *monomitic', those with two
hyphal types were ‘dimitic’, and those with three were 'trimitic'. Corner's personal#Misc-exposition*]
[@66 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Page-header*]

[@experience allowed ‘dimitic’ to include a combination of generative plus skeletal
hyphae or generative plus binding hyphae, but other variations of miticity (i.e. inclusion
of gloeoplerous or laticiferous hyphae in combination with generative hyphae, etc.;
see Pegler, 1983, 1996, for a more complete exposition) were largely overlooked for
they did not seem important to the classification of the polypores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These definitions were carried to the clavarioid fungi (Corner, 1950), where skeletal
hyphae were found in certain basidiomata, and also in the rhizomorphs of some
Ramaria taxa (Petersen, 1975). In Lachnocladium, skeletal hyphae were modified into
highly branched structures, while in Ramaria they were largely unbranched. Later
(Corner, 1970) further modifications to the original definition were made, chiefly that
skeletal hyphae could appear as intercalary segments, arising from and reverting to
the generative morphology (i.e. as found in Ramaria gracilis, R. rubella and others).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As time elapsed, these terms of miticity and hyphal types were augmented so that
now they have become somewhat blurred. Nonetheless, these concepts were applied
to other fungi, and in fact, di- or trimitic hyphal construction (sensu Corner) came to
exclude members of the Agaricales, and became semi-diagnostic for members of the
Aphyllophorales. If a basidioma was monomitic it could be placed in the Agaricales
or the Aphyllophorales, but if it was dimitic or trimitic (sensu Corner), it was excluded
from the Agaricales. While it was recognized that other hyphal types might be found
in basidiomatal tissues (i.e. gloeoplerous hyphae, subdivided by staining affinities of
contents; viz. the Gomphaceae, where gloeoplerous hyphae are cyanophilous, versus
the Auriscalpiaceae where they are blackish in sulfobenzaldehyde), and while presence
of such hyphal types alter Corner’s terms (i.e. Lentinellus, in which basidiomata of
several species exhibit generative, skeletal and gloeoplerous hyphal types, which Cor-
ner would term dimitic, gloeoplerous hyphae having never been included in his sum-
mary of hyphal construction), this discussion pertains to Pleurotus and definition of
its basidiomatal tissue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Corner (1983) became discontent with attempts to refine his basic mitic plan and
put forward subcategories of dimiticity. Later (Corner, 1991) the expanded system
was outlined again. Pegler (1996) furnished a history of research on miticity in Basidio-
mycotina, including Pleurotus under dimitic construction with “limited skeletal hyphae
... ‘type d4’ of Corner” (1983, 1991). The word ‘limited’, however, indicated the termi-
nation of individual skeletal hyphae within the tissue (I cannot conceptualize an
alternative), not limitation as intercalary lengths limited by clamp-connections at origin
from and reversion to generative hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Micromorphological examination of some Pleurotus basidiomata, especially of stipe
medullary tissue, reveals the presence of two hyphal types (and occasionally, rare gloeo-
plerous hyphae). One hyphal type seems to form the flesh substance and, while often
thick-walled, hyphae are frequently septate/clamped so in traditional Cornerian termi-
nology are generative hyphae. A second hyphal type (again in basidiomata of only
some species) appears long-celled, thick-walled, and refringent under phase contrast
microscopy. Superficially, these resemble skeletal hyphae, and based on the presence
of such hyphae, such tissues have been called dimitic (Stankovicova, 1974; Pegler,
1977). Although occasionally these skeletal hyphae are found in pileus and lamellar
tramae, the most reliable tissue in which they are to be seen is the stipe medulla. When
carefully analysed, however, these skeletal hyphal segments are seen often to be inter-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Albertö, Petersen, Hughes & Lechner: Notes on Pleurotus 67#Page-header*]

[@calary, and/or to bear occasional internal clamp-connections. They are not skeletal
hyphae sensu Corner, therefore, and tissues which include them are not strictly dimitic
sensu Corner. Pilát (1965) recognized this discrepancy in a discussion of P. calyptratus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stankovicova (1974) reported that certain species of Pleurotus were monomitic (i.e.
P. ostreatus) while others (i.e. P. calyptratus, P. *sajor-caju var. dactyliophora’) were
considered dimitic or perhaps trimitic. The accurate identity of the latter taxon cannot
be judged, for Pegler (1983) ascertained that true P. sajor-caju was a Lentinus, not
Pleurotus. Stankovicova (1974) made no distinction between various types of skeletal
hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Perhaps based on this hyphal construction (i.e. “dimitic’), Pleurotus has been linked
with the genera Polyporus (Pegler, 1983; Hibbett & Vilgalys, 1993) and Lentinus
(Corner, 1981; Petersen & Nicholl, 1997). Taxa of all three genera produce large, non-
amyloid basidiospores of comparable size and shape and basidiomata of ‘pleurotoid’
habit (i.e. imbricate, stipe-less basidiomata to stoutly, usually eccentrically or laterally
stipitate habit). Early molecular evidence included Pleurotus in phylogenetic recon-
structions concerned chiefly with Lentinus (Hibbett & Vilgalys, 1993), but later refine-
ments showed that Pleurotus was actually within the Agaricales (Montcalvo et al.,
2000; Thorn et al., 2000). With this phylogenetic alignment, Pleurotus appears to be
one of very few agaric genera (or perhaps the only genus) with ‘dimitic’ hyphal con-
struction.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Should a new term be coined for the ‘dimitic’ hyphal construction in some Pleurotus
species? We think not, but awareness of this anomaly in Pleurotus is urged, with the
suggestion that future descriptions be worded carefully to take such hyphal construction
into account.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We tentatively conclude that Pleurotus includes three groups based on a combination
of hyphal construction and general habit. In all cases occasional to rare gloeoplerous
hyphae are also found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type I — Stipe trama: hyphae frequently clamped, often somewhat inflated, usually
thick-walled, relatively uniform in appearance (i.c. skeletalized generative hyphae;
monomitic). Lamella trama: hyphae as in stipe tissue but less thick-walled. Basidiomata
strongly eccentrically stipitate with inconspicuous pileus extension over stipe [i.c.
P. ostreatus, P. populinus, P. pulmonarius, P. abieticola) to centrally or subcentrally
stipitate (i.e. P. albidus, P. eryngii), soft-fleshy; pileus trama usually over 5 mm thick
near stipe , etc. ].#Misc-exposition*]

tions initiative to occasionally intercalary, especially near bases of hyphal branches.

[@The genus Pholiota, an important genus in forestry since many species are parasitic
on woody plants, has been monographed by the author on the basis of numerous collec-
tions from the whole of North-western and Central Europe. After the introductory chap-
ters with extensive information on material and methods, an overview is given of the
current state of knowledge on the genus and the characters used for delimitation of
taxa, The taxonomic part gives an infrageneric classification, followed by keys to the
subgenera and species. All accepted taxa are fully described and illustrated with line-
drawings. In addition most species are illustrated in colour with at least one, but in
many cases even two photographs. Notes are given on ecology and distribution, and
all collections studied are cited per country of origin. The discussions are often elaborate
and give much additional information as to the status of the taxon versus related species
and interpretations in literature. Five new combinations have been made. The book
concludes with a long, annotated list of type studies, excluded and doubtful taxa, and
a very comprehensive list of references.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Holec’s concept of Pholiota follows in great lines that of Jacobsson (Windahlia 19,#Misc-exposition*]

[@1990) and Noordeloos (Flora agaricina neerlandica, vol. 4, 1999) with slight alterations.
Kuehneromyces is not included, and also the status of Pholiota albocrenulata,
P. oedipus, and P. myosotis is discussed. On species level, a wide species concept is
used for example in P. conisans, which includes both forms on wood and on grasses
(P. *graminis" ). The nomenclature of the group of P. aurivella, P. adiposa, and P. ceri-
fera has been adjusted, and follows Noordeloos (1. c.). Within section Spumosa, Holec
records besides the known European taxa P. spumosa, P. mixta, and P. highlandensis,
a collection of Pholiota brunnescens, originally described from North America, and
indicates that more taxa can be expected in this group. The present study is exemplary
for how a good monograph should be made: it is very complete and consistent. As
such it should be widely used and consulted by everyone working in taxonomy and
forestry.#Misc-exposition*]

tainous and alpine areas of the Sierra de Guadarrama (Madrid, Segovia) are pre-
sented, From a chronological point of view several new records for the Iberian
Peninsula are interesting: Lepidoderma carestianum, Lepidoderma granuliferum,

[@Key words: nivicolous Myxomycetes, Physarales, Stemonitales, Trichiales, Spain,
SEM, chronology, taxonomy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nivicolous Myxomycetes have scarcely been studied in Spain. Gracia (1986), who
cited three species in the Catalanian Pyrenees, made the first contribution. Later Lado
(1992) and Illana et al. (1993) paid attention to the Sierra de Guadarrama, from which
they reported new records.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Sierra de Guadarrama is a mountain range situated in the centre of the peninsula
forming part of the provinces Segovia and Madrid. As our last mycological inves-
tigations in these mountains yielded success, we were encouraged to study this area
more exhaustively; especially the Segovian part of the mountains, where the autoch-
thonous vegetation is better conserved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this paper, 11 taxa of the orders Stemonitales, Trichiales and Physarales are pre-
sented. A second part will deal with nivicolous species of the genus Diderma and, in
the last work, the collection of nivicolous Lamproderma will be presented.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The investigated area, Sierra de Guadarrama, is part of Spain, which is surrounded
by Portugal, France and Africa (Morocco). From May 1996 to June 1999, 35 samples
were collected in 4 different localities situated in Segovia and Madrid as indicated on
the map (Fig. 1).#Misc-exposition*]

deep yellowish peridium with brown patches, and its ‘trichioid’ , elateriform capillitium,
ornamented with 4 or 5 smooth spiral bands (Fig. 31) with pointed free ends (Figs.
32, 33) and a few short secondary branchlets (Fig. 30). The spore ornamentation is
dense and consists of baculae with plane, broad and coralloid apices (Figs. 34, 35).

[@Trichia sordida var. sordidoides Mana & G. Moreno is characterised by its “hemitri-
chioid’ capillitium with 4 to 5 smooth spiral bands, many short secondary branchlets
and few free ends. The striking difference between the two variations is the form of
the capillitium being ‘trichioid’ in 7: sordida var. sordida and ‘hemitrichioid’ in
T. sordida var. sordidoides. We did not observe intermediate capillitia between the
two varieties. Hence we prefer to maintain the two varieties and do not follow the
concept of Lado & Pando (1997), who unify these two taxa.#Description*]

[@CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A MONOGRAPH OF PHOMA

Section Macrospora#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. DE GRUYTER#Misc-exposition*]
[@Plant Protection Service, P.O. Box 9102, 6700 HC Wageningen, The Netherlands#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nine species of Phoma, characterised by always producing relatively large conidia,
usually between 7-25 x 2.5-8 m, aseptate or partly septate, are documented and
described in vitro. Three of these fungi could not be described in the usual way,
because living cultures were no longer available. The following new taxa are pro-
posed: Phoma andropogonivora (R. Sprague & Rogerson) comb. nov., Phoma
boeremae nom. nov., Phoma commelinicola (E. Young) comb. nov. and Phoma
gossypiicola nom. nov. The combination Phoma rabiei proposed by Khune is vali-
dated along with its teleomorph Mycosphaerella rabiei Kovatsch. Keys and indices
on host-fungus and fungus-host relationships are provided and short comments
on the ecology and distribution are given.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Phoma-sections treated so far in this series of Contributions include species usually
producing relatively small conidia, i.e. between (2-)3-11(-13) x (0.5-)1.5-4(-5)
µm (‘normal size’, compare Boerema, 1997). This applies particularly to sections
Phoma (De Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992 and De Gruyter et al., 1993, 1998), Peyro-
nellaea (Boerema, 1993) and Paraphoma (De Gruyter & Boerema, 2002). Other sec-
tions, however, include species that sometimes also produce significantly larger coni-
dia. This is also characteristic of section Heterospora: “Taxa with large sized conidial
dimorphs” (Boerema et al., 1997, 1999)!. Some quite large conidia also occur occa-
sionally in species of the sections Sclerophomella (Boerema & de Gruyter, 1998),
Phyllostictoides (Van der Aa et al., 2000 and De Gruyter et al., 2002) and Plenodomus
(Boerema et al., 1994, 1996 and Boerema & de Gruyter, 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The section Macrospora Boerema, de Gruyter & Noordel. (Boerema, 1997), treated
in this paper, is characterised by always producing relatively large conidia both in
vivo and in vitro, (7-)8-19(- 25) x (2.5-)3-7(-9) µm. The conidia are initially aseptate,
but they may become l-septate by secondary septation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@So far, nine species studied in vitro have been included in this section. Of three of
these species, discussed in an Addendum here, only some characteristics of growth in
vitro could be noted since living cultures are no longer available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type species, Phoma zeae-maydis Punith. and some other species of the section
were originally interpreted as large spored species of Phyllosticta (‘Macrostiteae’).#Misc-exposition*]

[@1) To be added to the species of sect. Heterospora discussed in those two papers are two South
American pathogens, viz. Phoma andigena Turkenst. and Phoma crystalliniformis (Loer.,
R. Navarro, Lobo & Turkenst.) Noordel. & de Gruyter, see Noordeloos et al., 1993 and Boerema
etal., 1995.#Misc-exposition*]
[@86 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Page-header*]

[@Due to the large conidia and the occasional occurrence of a septum, some species were
also classified in Ascochyta.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ultrastructure of conidiogenesis in one of the species presently arranged under
sect. Macrospora, viz. Phoma rabiei (Pass.) Khune has characteristics typical of the
genus Phoma: a three-layered apical thickening of the conidiogenous cell prior to the
formation of the first conidium, and conidial septa attaining from the very start the
thickness of a final septum? (Singh et al., 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two species, including the type species, have been connected with a teleomorph
belonging to Mycosphaerella Johanson.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates and herbarium specimens were studied as described in the previous
Contributions I-1 and I-2 of this series (De Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992 and De
Gruyter et al., 1993). Additional information on terminology (colony colour, outline
and diameter usually after 7 days, Q or conidial length-width ratio) is given in Contri-
bution VII (Boerema & de Gruyter, 1998). The isolates studied are currently in the
culture collections of CBS, Utrecht (formerly Baarn) and the Plant Protection Service,

[@Ecology and distribution. A noxious pathogen of chickpea, Cicer arietinum. The
disease, Anthracnose, Chickpea Blight (or ‘Ascochyta’ Blight), is the major disease in
most chickpea-growing areas. Being seed-borne, the mycelium may be present in the
seed coat and cotyledons, and conidia often contaminate the seed surface (Mathur,
1981). Despite the usually unicellular conidia in vivo, the anamorph has been confused
with Ascochyta pisi Lib., type species of Ascochyta (conidia mainly septate in vivo
and in vitro, *wall-thickening septation’; see Khune & Kapoor, 1980). In phytopatho-
logical literature the anamorph is commonly called Ascochyta rabiei and “the ascochyta
pathogen of chickpea’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungus shows great variation in virulence. It appears to be heterothallic, because
compatible mating types are required for development of fertile pseudothecia. Both
pycnidia and pseudothecia may develop on overwintered chickpea debris, but compared
with pycnidia very few pseudothecia develop. For detailed information on the life cycle
of this pathogen see Kaiser (1997).#Misc-exposition*]

my friend Gerhard(us Hendrik) Boerema, then head of the Mycological Department
of the Dutch Plant Protection Service. In an annotation dated June 1985 he had sug-
gested that it might belong to Macrophoma medicaginis Hollós, described from dried
stems of Medicago falcata in Hungary in 1926. It should be noted that the species of
Medicago cultivated in Australia are all of Mediterranean origin and as expected the
various other Phoma species found on seeds of Medicago in Australia are common in
Europe. As the epithet medicaginis is no longer available for Phoma, I am very pleased
to name this typically large spored Phoma species after Gerhard Boerema. Our present
knowledge of Phoma taxonomy is based on his work, in co-operation with several
colleagues over recent decades. Retired for 15 years already, he is still working on
Phoma, and continues to stimulate me with his enthusiasm, experience and knowledge
to do this taxonomic work.#Misc-exposition*]

large conidia always remain one-celled in vitro, but in vivo most conidia may become

soil-borne and probably occurs everywhere cotton is grown. Isolates studied were from
North America (United States), India and Africa (Sudan). The fungus may also attack
other cultivated crops (Holliday & Punithalingam, 1970). However, the literature on
its host range must be read with much reserve, because the fungus has been confused
with other species such as Phoma pomorum Thiim. (sect. Peyronellaea) and Phoma

[@Note. The main host of this soil- and seed-borne necrophyte is Chenopodium album,
but it has also been found on some other Chenopodiaceae, e.g., Atriplex crassifolia
and Beta vulgaris. The above synonyms refer to specimens collected in Pakistan and
India (herb. HCIO, IMI), but the fungus is also recorded in Russia and the Netherlands
(Boerema, 1984). The relatively large conidia (7.5—16 x 3—5 µm in vivo) with septation

IN TWO NEOTTIELLA SPECIES (PEZIZALES, ASCOMYCOTA)#Misc-exposition*]

[@BELLIS KULLMAN#Misc-exposition*]

[@Genome size, life cycle, and ploidy were determined for Neottiella vivida (Nyl.)
Dennis and N. rutilans (Fr.) Dennis. The relative DNA content was measured from
fruit-bodies using cytofluorometry; genome size was obtained by comparison with
two standards: conidia of Trichophea hemisphaerioides (23.3 Mb) and a spore-
print from Pleurotus ostreatus (25 Mb). Neottiella vivida and N. rutilans were found
to have genomes of approximately 750 Mb and 530 Mb, respectively. The ploidy
level of N. rutilans is 50, that of N. vivida was calculated to be 70. In N. vivida,
meiotic division occurs in the ascus apex where giant mitochondria with a DNA
content of 60 Mb, 54 Mb, and 30 Mb were found.#Abstract*]

[@The two species are morphologically very similar and can be distinguished only
by their ascospore ornamentation, which is reticulated in N. rutilans and warted in
N. vivida, Due to endoreduplication in the uninucleate ascospores of N. vivida, the
value of their nuclear DNA content is 2C. In N. rutilans, endoreduplication is not
arrested at the 2C value but may proceed at a different rate in spores. Thus N. ruti-
lans reveals heterogeneity in ploidy levels of sporal nuclei. In N. vivida and
N. rutilans, differences in spore ornamentation may result from different patterns
of gene expression regulated by the ploidy-dependent gene.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Quantification of changes in nuclear DNA has significantly contributed to a better
understanding of the life cycle of several fungi (Olive, 1953; Bryant & Howard, 1969;
Collins, 1979; Franklin et al., 1983; Anderson, 1982; Collins et al. 1983; Whisler et
al., 1983; Horgen et al., 1985; Bresinsky et al., 1987; Wittmann-Meixner, 1989; Bayman
& Collins, 1990; Weber, 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Changes of nuclear DNA content occur at DNA replication and cell division, in the
evolution of species, and during differentiation of cells in an organism. Ascomycetes
with a sexual cycle double their ploidy upon fertilization in the ascus and reduce their
ploidy by half at meiosis, producing ascospores. In the vegetative mycelium, the nuclear
DNA content varies during the mitotic (G1 versus G2 phases) cycle of cell division.
In the development of the organism, specialized polyploid cell types may arise through
endocycles, i.e. cell cycles lacking cell division. Cells differing only by their ploidy
are identical in terms of DNA sequence information, but are often quite different in
terms of developmental, morphological, and physiological characteristics (Galitski et
al., 1999; Hieter & Griffiths, 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The term genome denotes the DNA of the haploid chromosome complement in terms
of quality and quantity. The DNA content of the unreplicated haploid nuclear genome
is known as its 1C-value (Swift, 1950). Dividing cells pass through a regular, repeated
sequence of events known as the cell cycle. The cell cycle is divided into interphase
and mitosis. Interphase is a period of chromosome duplication. Interphase can be divid-#Misc-exposition*]
[@104 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Page-header*]

[@ed into three phases, which are designed G1, S, and G2. Mitosis and cytokinesis together
are referred to as the M phase of the cell cycle. The specialized resting, or dormant,
state is called the GO phase (G-zero phase). In the cell cycle, progression is mainly
controlled at two crucial transition points, called checkpoints — one at the end of G1
and another at the end of G2. It is at the G1 checkpoint that the control system either
arrests the cycle or triggers a process that will initiate the S phase (synthesis phase).
At the G2 checkpoint, the control system again either arrests the cycle or initiates
mitosis (Raven et al., 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species in Sclerotiniaceae and Leotiaceae (Helotiales) often have uninucleate spores
with the 2C-value (Weber, 1992). The undivided nuclei of the large-budded fraction
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Meyen ex Reese) Hansen are arrested in the anaphase
or metaphase, i.e. in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Hanna et al., 1995). However, the
nuclei of spores of most species in Helotiales (Weber, 1992), as well as Glomus versi-
forme (P. Karst.) S. M. Berch (Bianciotto et al., 1995) and species in the genera Pleuro-
tus (Fr.) P. Kumm. and Phellinus Quél. (Kullman, 2000) are arrested in the G0/GI
phase (at the 1C-value).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hence, although measurements per se cannot reveal whether each individual nucleus
actually progresses through the cell cycle or not, kinetic information can be inferred
from DNA content (position of the cell cycle). Progression through the S-phase and
mitosis is expressed by changes in nuclear DNA content. The position of the nuclei in
the cell cycle can therefore be estimated on the basis of measurement of DNA content.
When measuring nuclei in the haplophase (nuclei with a ‘single set’ of chromosomes),
a distribution curve is obtained whose first maximum (basic DNA content), indicating
nuclei in the cell cycle GO/G1 phase, corresponds to genome size (1C-value — the DNA
content of the unreplicated haploid nuclear genome, unit) (see Kullman, 2000).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In studies of polyploidy in fungi, variation of nuclear relative DNA content due to
the mitotic cycle was tested by Bresinsky et al. (1987), Wittman-Meixner & Bresinsky
(1989), Weber (1992), and Weber & Bresinsky (1992). It was shown that basic nuclear
DNA content is the same in young and old mycelia (irrespective of the medium and
the age of the culture), as well as in fruit-bodies, sclerotia or conidia. In young mycelia,
DNA values are comparable to those of the fruit-body. Most nuclei are in the GO/G1
phase of the cell cycle. In haplonts nuclear DNA content in this cell cycle phase corre-
sponds to their genome size.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the dikaryophase, two nuclei combine to form a zygote (nuclei in diplophase
with a ‘double set’ of chromosomes). In fungi the zygote is the only diploid (2n) cell.
In the ascus, the nucleus is divided immediately by meiosis (zygotic meiosis), thus
restoring the haploid (n) condition in the life cycle (n — the haploid chromosome set,
unit). The cell nuclei may undergo endoreduplication (DNA replication in absence of
mitotic cell division) and endopolyploidy (‘many set’ of chromosomes) can be assumed
to occur (x — the basic chromosome set, the basic DNA content in germ-line polyploids)
(Nagel, 1978).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since in some cases the content of nuclear DNA in the fruit-body (often in tips of
paraphyses but also in all other cell types) appeared to be larger, endopolyploidy was
assumed to occur in ascomycetes (Weber, 1992) and in basidiomycetes (Paxillus,
Serpula, and Leucogyrophana (Meixner & Bresinsky, 19888 Wittman-Meixner & Bre-
sinsky, 1989).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Kullman: Nucleair DNA in two Neottiella species 105#Page-header*]

[@In this study the nuclear behaviour of two moss parasites, the ascomycetes Neottiella
vivida and N. rutilans, is examined. The main aim was to establish whether there occur
changes in ploidy during fungal growth and morphogenesis, as well as to determine
absolute genome sizes and ploidy levels in these species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fruit-bodies of Neortiella vivida (Nyl.) Dennis, Norway, Tromsö, Brennfjell, 26 Aug.

Sana, 25 Aug. 1998, A. Jakobson (TAA 135730), were fixed in Carnoy (Romeis, 1948)
and kept at 4°C until needed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The slides used for measuring relative nuclear DNA content were also used for mea-
suring spore dimensions with an ‘AMPLIVAL’ microscope equipped with an HI 100
immersion objective. The length (1) and width (w) of spores are presented in the follow-
ing form: lean X Wmean HM, Where lean ANd Winean denote the mean values of the length
and width of 20 spores from a specimen. The variation coefficient is equivalent to the
standard deviation as a percentage divided by the mean value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For staining nuclei the material was squeezed between the slide and the cover-slip
and subjected to the DAPI-staining procedure described in Bresinsky et al. (1987),
Wittmann-Meixner (1989), Weber (1992), and Büttner (1999). The relative DNA con-
tent in nuclei and mitochondria was measured by cytofluorometry at the Institute of
Botany, Regensburg University, using a Zeiss UNIVERSAL photomicroscope, equip-
ped with an III RS epifluorescence illuminator, and an 03 Zeiss microscope photo-
meter. The measured fluorescence intensity (in arbitrary units — a.u.) is proportional
to DNA content in the nucleus. When measuring nuclei in the haplophase, a distribution
curve is obtained whose first maximum, indicating nuclei in the cell cycle GO/G1 phase,
corresponds to the genome size.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The resulting fluorescence histograms can be analyzed for calculating the difference
in nuclear DNA content between the specimens. By including an internal standard,
relative DNA content is converted to the absolute amount. The genome size of an un-
known specimen is obtained by dividing the mean relative DNA content of the unknown
G0/G1 population of nuclei by the mean of the standard G0/GI population of nuclei
and by multiplying the result by the genome size of the standard. Usually DNA content
is expressed in picograms (pg) or in base pairs (bp), kilobases (kb, a stretch of 1000
nucleotide pairs in DNA) and megabase pairs of nucleotides (Mb) (NB Ipg = 965
Mb, see Bennet & Leitch, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genome size of N. vivida and N. rutilans was estimated by comparison with
two standards: conidia from a pure culture of the ascomycete Trichophaea hemi-
sphaerioides (Mounton) Graddon (TFC 97-71 from TAA 147708) and a spore-print
from the oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.: Fr.) P. Kumm. (TAA 142824).
The genome size of T. hemisphaerioides was 23.3 Mb, and that of P. ostreatus 25 Mb
(Kullman, 2000).#Misc-exposition*]

a dikaryophase, confined upon fructification, and asci which represent zygotes. Here
the nuclei are in the diplophase of the life cycle. When the ascus nucleus divides, divi-
sion is meiotic and meiospores are formed (Figs. 1, 3, 4a-h).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The presence of up to double DNA content in the nuclei of hyphae and paraphyses
indicates mitotic cell cycle phases GO/G1 and G2/M (Figs. 2, 6d, e). During the growth
of a fruit-body nuclei divide within the hyphae but remain stable within the paraphyses
at maturity (except for the nuclei of their apical cells).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Kullman: Nucleair DNA in two Neottiella species 107#Page-header*]

[@In N. vivida, the mean DNA content in the nuclei of the paraphyses (DNA content
of the nuclei at the tip was not measured in this case) was 750 Mb + 9% and in the
nuclei of the hyphae 770 Mb + 36%. In the first case the measured nuclei were only in
the GO/G1 phase, while in the second case, most nuclei were in the GO/G1 phase and
some were in the G2/M phase. The mean DNA content of the hyphae is larger and
more variable compared with the mean DNA content of the paraphyses due to the mitot-
ic division of the first. Hence the nuclei of the paraphyses are more suitable for measure-
ment of the C-value than the nuclei of the subhymenium hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When measuring fluorescence on nuclei, noise (additional light including the auto-
fluorescence of cells) accounts for 6% when paraphyses are used, 12% when hyphae
are used, and 12% when spores are used from total measured fluorescence (fluorescence
of nuclear DNA-DAPI complex + noise). For this reason too, paraphyses should be
preferred in determination of relative DNA content and genome size. In this case the
1C-value, i.e. genome size, was determined as 750 Mb for N. vivida and as 530 Mb
for N. rutilans (see Materials and Methods).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Development of the ascus#Misc-exposition*]

[@The asci of N. vivida develop from croziers according to the Neottiella-type pattern
of karyogamy (Read & Beckett, 1996; Chiu & Moore, 1999) (Fig. 1). Two nuclei in
the hooked cell undergo conjugate mitoses (Mi) after which two septa are formed cre-
ating three cells (Fig. la—c). The three cells of the crozier are termed the terminal
cell, the penultimate cell, and the stalk cell, representing respectively the first, the second,
and the third cell of the crozier. The penultimate cell is binucleate, whereas the two
other cells are uninucleate. At first, two prefusion nuclei with the basic DNA content
are located in the terminal cell and in the stalk cell, respectively. The nucleus of the
terminal cell then migrates into the stalk cell (Figs. 4a, 5). This binucleate cell, con-
taining non-sister nuclei, may become the ascus mother cell, in which karyogamy (K)
takes place (Fig. 5). In the young ascus, the first meiotic division (Mel) (Figs. 1f, 4c)
and the second meiotic division (Me2) (Figs. 1g, 4d) give rise to four daughter nuclei
with the basic DNA content, each of which divides by mitosis (Mi) to form eight asc-
ospore nuclei (Figs. 1h, 4e). Formation of ascospores results from the infolding of the
membranes around the nuclei (Figs. 1i, 4f). In a maturing spore, the nucleus with con-
densing chromatin remains between two vacuoles (Figs. 1j, 4h).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Changes in ploidy level during DNA replication and cell division at the time of sporu-
lation — Fig. 6#Misc-exposition*]

[@After karyogamy the DNA content of the nucleus has the 4C-value. The mean DNA
content was determined as 3060 Mb (Fig. 6a). The C-value can be measured exactly
after the first meiotic division (Mel) when the formed nuclei have a stable DNA content
(2C) until the next division (Figs. 1f, 4c). In such nuclei, the mean DNA content was
1500 Mb (then IC = 1500 : 2 = 750 Mb, the same IC-value like in paraphyses).#Misc-exposition*]

[@After the second meiotic division (Me2; Figs. 1g, 6b) and mitosis (Mi; Fig. Ih) the
following DNA synthesis may occur asynchronously (Fig. 3d). After Me2, mean nucle-
ar DNA content was 770 Mb and after Mi 810 Mb. Thereafter, eight uninucleate asco-
spores with the 2C-value are formed. In such nuclei, mean DNA content was measured
at 1350 Mb for N. vivida (Fig. 6c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kullman: Nucleair DNA in two Neottiella species 109#Page-header*]

[@The spore nuclei of Neottiella species studied here undergo endoreduplication (DNA
replication in absence of mitotic cell division). In N. rutilans, endoreduplication is
not arrested at the 2C-value as in N. vivida, but may proceed at a different rate in spores.
In N. rutilans spores with DNA values of 2C, 3C, 5C, and 6C have been measured and
endopolyploidy can be assumed to occur at different levels. These uninucleate spores
are heteroploid. No differences have been found in spore sizes between the two
specimens studied: spore sizes in N. rutilans have been measured at 23.1 µm + 5% x
12.8 µm + 5% and in N. vivida at 22.8 µm * 496 x 13.0 µm + 3%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascogenous hyphal differentiation#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is evidence that species may reveal considerable variation in the pattern of
ascogenous hyphal differentiation; significant variation can even be found within a
single genus (Thelebolus Tode: Fr., Kimbrough, 1981). The precise ontogeny of asco-
genous hyphae is usually difficult to study. Neottiella vivida with extremely large nuclei
is the most appropriate species for this kind of research.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In N. vivida, ascogenous hyphae may branch repeatedly. In this case both cells, the
penultimate cell and the stalk cell (containing also the migrate nucleus from the terminal
cell), elongate to form a new crozier (Figs. 4a, 5). However, in the case of the Neottiella
type pattern of karyogamy, asci can be formed one after another from the terminal
and the stalk cells, while the penultimate cell initiates formation of new croziers contin-
uously (Fig. 5). All nuclei of ascogenous hyphae, except for nuclei in the initial
penultimate cell, can be potentially used in karyogamy for formation of zygotes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Time of premeiotic DNA synthesis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Premeiotic DNA replication in fungi is known to occur usually before and sometimes
after karyogamy. In N. vivida, premeiotic DNA replication occurs before karyogamy,
as in N. rutilans (Rossen & Westergaard, 1966) and Neurospora crassa Shear & B.O.
Dodge (lyengar et al., 1977), and synchronously in all four nuclei of the crozier cells
(Figs. 3a, b, terminal and stalk cells are not shown) (Figs. 4a, 5). It is possible that
delayed premeiotic DNA synthesis is a general condition in fungi with a homokaryotic
fruit-body (Bayman & Collins, 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DNA content of giant mitochondria#Misc-exposition*]

[@Giant mitochondria are visible in the ascus apex. The DNA content of giant mito-
chondria was determined to be 60 Mb, 54 Mb, and 30 Mb (Fig. 4i).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mitochondrial genome size of eight ascomycetes was found to be from 18.9
b.k. (Torulopsis glabrata (H. W. Anderson) Lodder & N.F. de Vries) to 108 b.k. (Bret-
tanomyces custersii Florenz.) (Weber, 1993). Obviously, the mitochondrion of N. vivida
with high DNA content contains multiple strands of DNA. Different DNA contents of
mitochondria reveal the existence of a different number of strands in their nucleoids.
Kuroiwa et al. (1996) examined the development of giant mitochondria of the plant
Pelargonium zonale Aiton during megasporogenesis and megagametogenesis. They
found that DNA content within the stacked mitochondrion increased up to 40 times
compared with that at the megaspore mother cell stage; a single stack of mitochondria
contained 340-1700 Mb DNA.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nuclear genome size#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study the genome size of N. rutilans was determined to be 530 Mb and that
of N. vivida 750 Mb. Genome sizes for Pezizales ranged from 12 Mb for Pulvinula
sp. (author’s unpublished data) to 750 Mb for N. vivida. The majority of genome sizes
reported earlier for other fungi fall in this range too (Durán & Gray, 1989; Wittman-
Meixner, 1989; Zolan, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The overall genome size estimated in this study for Neottiella species was signifi-
cantly larger than that of the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13 Mb,
data are available on internet: ftp.ebi.ac.uk) and other filamentous fungi. For example,
the following genome sizes have been determined: for P. ostreatus 21 Mb (Sagawa &
Nagata, 1992) and 24 to 30 Mb (two subpopulations in one spore-print differing in
DNA content by 4.9 Mb (20%), Kullman, 2000), 31 Mb (Peberdy et al., 1993) and 35
Mb (Larraya et al., 1999), for Trichophaea hemisphaerioides (Mouton) Graddon 23
Mb (Kullman, 2000), for Penicillium paxilli Bainier 23 Mb (Itoh et al.,1994), for Histo-

gillus) nidulans (Eidam) Vuill. 26 Mb (Timberlake,1978) to 31 Mb (Brody & Carbon,
1989), for Podospora anserina (Rabenh.) Niessl 34 Mb (Javerzat et al., 1993), for

[@Ploidy levels and speciation#Misc-exposition*]
[@When among ascomycetes the ploidy level of N. rutilans is approximately 50
(Weber, 1992), then, using genome sizes, the ploidy level of N. vivida was calculated#Misc-exposition*]
[@112 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Page-header*]

[@to be 70. The two species are very similar and can be distinguished only by their spores,
which possess an incomplete reticulum in N. rutilans and delicate regular warts in
N. vivida. Heteroploid spores of N. rutilans have a high variability of spore ornamen-
tation. Some spores have more restricted warts which are not completely connected
to form a reticulate ornament. According to Galitski et al. (1999) (see also Hieter &
Griffiths, 1999), cells of the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, differing
only in their ploidy, are identical in terms of DNA sequence information and relative
gene dosage, but show different patterns of gene expression. In N. vivida and N. rutilans,
the differences in spore ornamentation may be the result of different gene expressions
regulated by a ploidy-dependent gene.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the spores of N. rutilans are heteroploid, some spores of N. rutilans and N. vivida
have the same DNA content. There is as yet no evidence of haploidization of these
spore nuclei at germination. It is also known that two closely related species of Leo-
tiales, ‘Hymenoscyphus' equisetinus (Velen.) Dennis and 'H.'rhodoleucus (Fr.) Z.S.
Bi, having the same genome size, differ only in the relative DNA content of their uni-
nucleate spores (1C and 2C, respectively) and in spore width (Weber, 1992). It can be
speculated that in such cases polyploidy will repeatedly confirm taxonomically de-
scribed speciation, as suggested by Bresinsky & Wittmann-Bresinsky (1995) for
Boletales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCLUSIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the true fungi, species of Neottiella serve as excellent objects for cytogenetic
investigations due to their extraordinarily large nuclear DNA content and low cell auto-
fluorescence. Neottiella vivida and N. rutilans were found to have genomes of approx-
imately 750 Mb and 530 Mb, respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neottiella rutilans is the first ascomycete in which heteroploidy of spores has been
discovered. Probably different levels of endopolyploidy in its spores account for the
large variability of spore ornamentation within one specimen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Giant mitochondria were found in the ascus, indicating intensive aerobic respiration
and energy generation for metabolic activity associated with meiospore formation. It
is demonstrated in flowering plants that the number of plastids ultimately produced
per cell is a function of the level of endopolyploidy (Butterfass, 1967, 1973). The con-
verse idea is that nuclear DNA replication is regulated by plastids, as appears to be
the case with Chlamydomonas Ehrenberg (Blamire et al., 1974). This problem needs
further research in fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Neotiella-type pattern of karyogamy is in principle maximally economical. All
nuclei of ascogenous hyphae, except for the nuclei in the initial, i.e. penultimate cells,
have the potential to be used in karyogamy for production of zygotes. In this case, all
replicated DNA in ascogenous hyphae can eventually be used for spore production.
However, there are two alternatives allowing regulation of spore production: formation
of asci one after another, or formation of new croziers, i.e. new branches (instead of
asci), for simultaneous production of a large number of asci. It can be speculated that
the first alternative is more frequent in species with small primitive ascomata, while
the second alternative occurs in species with large, more differentiated ascomata. How-
ever, this argument requires further study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A RECONNAISSANCE OF THE GENUS PSEUDOBAEOSPORA
IN EUROPE I#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. BAS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nationaal Herbarium Nederland, Universiteit Leiden branch,
P.O. Box 9514, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands#Misc-exposition*]

[@About 40 collections of Pseudobaeospora species from all over Europe have been
studied. A key is presented to the 13 species recognised and two provisionally
defined ones. Latin diagnoses of six new species, one new variety and one new
forma are given.#Abstract*]

[@Part one of this paper contains an introduction, a key to the taxa studied and
Latin diagnoses of the new taxa. Part two will contain the description of the genus,
full descriptions and figures of all taxa treated, and discussions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After the surprising discovery (Bas, 1995) that the only two collections of Pseudo-
baeospora Singer available from the Netherlands differed considerably from each other
and from the only two species of Pseudobaeospora known from Europe at that time,
viz. P. pillodii (Quél.) Wasser and P. oligophylla (Singer) Singer, it became a matter
of great interest to discover the real identity of Pseudobaeospora collections recorded
in the literature. Requests to a number of colleagues for material resulted in a set of
about 40 collections, mostly filed as P. pillodii, sometimes as P. oligophylla, Pseudo-
baeospora spec. or Collybia spec. All these collections have been thoroughly analysed
and the outcome of these studies was rather surprising. It appeared to be possible to
distinguish in Europe 13 to 15 different species. A number of characters that were
rather neglected hitherto, such as structure of the pileipellis, colour reactions in KOH
and the presence of very distinct cheilocystidia in several species, turned out to be a
great help in clearing up the taxonomic situation in the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES ON SOME CHARACTERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopic characters#Misc-exposition*]

[@As only two collections of European Pseudobaeospora species could be studied in
fresh condition, nearly all the descriptions of macroscopic characters of the taxa in
this paper are based on field notes (often incomplete) by the collectors, colour slides
if available, and drawings. In some cases the size of the basidiocarps had to be estimated
from the size of dried specimens. Defining the colours is a special problem, since hardly
any references to colour codes are available, and notations like purplish, violaceous,
and lilacinous seem to have been used rather indiscriminately. More precise colour
notations are badly needed.#Misc-exposition*]
[@116 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 1, 2002#Page-header*]

[@Spores#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is a generic character of Pseudobaeospora that the spores become thick-walled
and dextrinoid. But it is insufficiently stressed in literature that this thickening of the
spore wall takes place after the spores have been shed. This is the reason why one
usually finds only a very limited amount of thick-walled spores among the thin-walled
spores on a fragment of a lamella, often not more than 1—10% (although occasionally
much higher). However, on the apex of the stipe and on the pileipellis only thick-walled
spores are found. The author considers only these spores fully mature. Therefore the
spore sizes given in this paper always refer to the thick-walled spores only. Notations
like [40/4] indicate the number of spores measured and the number of collections from
which these were taken.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sclerified basidia#Misc-exposition*]
[@Thick-walled brownish basidia occur frequently, but in strongly varying numbers.
Their absence or frequency seems to have little or no differentiating value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pileipellis structure#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileipellis is usually a cutis. But often its cells are so strongly inflated that the
pileipellis seems to be pseudoparenchymatic. Careful examination of radial sections
and ‘scalps’ shows that in these cases the inflated cells are arranged in radial or, more
rarely, irregularly disposed chains. In the newly described species P. celluloderma,
however, the pileipellis consists of erect inflated cells, forming a somewhat irregular
hymeniderm, which looks strictly round-celled when seen from above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sometimes the pileipellis is made up of two layers: the upper layer, the suprapellis,
composed of relatively narrow hyphae; the lower layer, the subpellis, composed of
chains of inflated cells. In some cases the suprapellis is very thin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caulocystidia#Misc-exposition*]
[@At least at the apex of the stipe, caulocystidia are always present, varying in shape
from filiform 10 broad)y clavate. They seem to heave litle diagnostic value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@KOH reactions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is in Pseudobaeospora a surprising range of colour reactions when fragments
are placed in a drop of 5% KOH. It has to be stressed here that except in P. pyrifera,
only fragments of dried material have been tested. This means that in fresh material
the colour change may be different. In fresh material of P. pyrifera the reaction was
merely stronger (L. Krieglsteiner, in litt.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of the small basidiocarps and the often scanty collections, the KOH-test
has usually been tried only on the pileipellis, although there are indications that the
reaction may be different in other parts of the basidiocarps, as for example in the context
of the stipe in P. pyrifera and P. jamonii. Fragments placed in KOH should be studied
immediately, because in one species, P. dichroa, a deep red pigment in the pileipellis
very soon starts to disappear in small clouds, after which the cells of the pileipellis
become green.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clamp-connections#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of Pseudobaeospora possess clamp-connections, which are usually
easy to find in the various tissues. When they seem to be absent, it is necessary to
check the base of the basidia, as in P. frieslandica Bas they appear to be restricted to
the base of the basidia and the subhymenium.#Misc-exposition*]

as the small, acutely umbonate, reddish, centrally stipitate basidiomes arising from an
extensive thick mycelium, covering the woody substrate on which it grows, globose
to subglobose spores with a strongly amyloid, almost reticulate ornamentation, sterile
lamella edge, abundant pleuromacrocystidia and the total absence of sphaerocytes in
the trama and context. Another characteristic feature of the present taxon is its pilei-
pellis, which is an epithelium to palisade (Verbeken, 1998). Its tropical origin, lignicol-
ous habitat, the presence of thin-walled elements in the epicutis, the filamentous
hymenophoral trama lacking sphaerocytes, the nearly globose spores and the presence
of pseudocystidia on the sides of the lamellae are indicative of section Venolactarius

to be related to L. ignifluus in the hirsute nature of the stipe base, subglobose spores

[@Since mycologists have become aware of a significant decline of (macro)fungi in the
last century due to environmental pollution and habitat destruction, conservation of
fungi has become an important issue. It is not clear, however, whether conservation
should be focused on the fungi themselves, the sites, the habitats or the host. This book
deals with the various aspects of fungal conservation in different parts of the world. It
has its origin in a Symposium organised by the British Mycological Society, comple-
mented by some invited papers to enhance the geographic coverage of the book. In 20
chapters several subjects are dealt with, varying from microfungus diversity in Kenya
to management of forest fungi in the USA, from the effects of nature management on
grassland fungi in the Netherlands to biodiversity action plans in the UK, from the
threats of mushroom cultivation to biodiversity in China to strategies for conservation
of fungi in Sicily. A general introduction and a discussion complete the book. The book
does not provide ready-made solutions for the conservation of fungi, but it does give
useful suggestions about how fungi can be included in conservation projects in a range
of circumstances. As such, the book is unique and recommended for all interested in
fungal conservation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HYGROCYBE MONTEVERDAE
A new species of subgenus Cuphophyllus (Agaricales)
from the Canary Islands (Spain)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Á. BANARES! & E. ARNOLDS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hygrocybe monteverdae, collected in monte-verde forest in the Canary Islands, is
proposed as a new species belonging to subgenus Cuphophyllus. Its most remark-
able character is the blackening lamellae after drying. being the sole species with
this feature in the subgenus.#Abstract*]

[@The ‘monte-verde’ (Pruno-Lauretalia azoricae Oberd. ex Rivas Mart. et al.) of the
Macaronesian Archipelago (Agores, Madeira and Canary Islands) is traditionally mis-
named ‘/aurisilva’ (Rivas-Martinez et al., 1993) because of its similarity with the
tropical montane lauroid and subtropical-temperate forest. It is a mediterranean hard-
leaved forest with a great floristic diversity and predominance of trees, belonging to
different plant families, with perennial, coriaceous and bright leaves similar to the
leaves of laurel (Laurus). Its origin has been founded by the temperate-subtropical
paleoflora extant at the end of the Tertiary at Mediterranean riversides which dis-
appeared in the course of the pleistocene glaciations. This community survived on the
islands as a plant relict of extraordinary singularity worldwide.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Its pluviometric regime is concentrated mainly in the coldest seasons, autumn and
winter; the summer is more of arid character. The annual average precipitation is 600—
1,000 mm. Its establishment between 300 and 1,000 m altitude at the northern slopes
of the islands is caused by the incidence of the humid Atlantic winds, ‘alisios’, that
support a pluviometric increase along the year by the horizontal precipitation phenom-
enon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Europe most species of Hygrocybe are found outside forests in old, poor grass-
lands, some in heathland and peat bogs (Arnolds, 1990). Some of these species are
also occasionally and locally found in deciduous forests on moist, rather fertile and
humous soils. In North-America most species of Hygrocybe, many of them conspecific
with European species, are widespread in a variety of forest types (Hesler & Smith,
1963). This ecological differentiation is not yet well-understood. On the Canary Islands
permanent, old pastures are almost absent. The ‘monte-verde’ constitutes the exclusive
habitat for Hygrocybe species in the Canary Islands. All 19 cited taxa for the Canary
Islands have been collected as terrestrial saprotrophic elements in the *monte-verde"
as well as in mixed ‘monte-verde’-pine forests (Beltrán, 1980; Banares et al., 1980,
1991, 1992, 1994; Banares & Beltrán, 1982; Beltrán et al., 1987, 1989; Banares, 1988;
Dähncke, 1998). Consequently, the ecological preferences of this genus show more
affinity to North-America than to Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ERYSIPHE HELLEBORI, A NEW AGENT OF POWDERY MILDEW
IN YUGOSLAVIA#Misc-exposition*]

[@BRANISLAV RANKOVIC#Misc-exposition*]

[@Faculty of Science, Institute of Biology, 34000 Kragujevac, Yugoslavia £#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new agent of powdery mildew in Yugoslavia, Erysiphe hellebori spec. nov., which
parasitizes Helleborus odoratus L., is described and illustrated.#Abstract*]

[@Fungi of the family Erysiphaceae are obligate parasites that infect a large number of
plants, on which they cause diseases known as powdery mildew. The flora of Spermato-
phyta in Yugoslavia is rich due to favourable climatic conditions, and an analogously
rich amount of parasitic fungi may be expected. However, the number of records of
powdery mildews in Yugoslavia is small and mainly confined to species on cultivated
plants (Marié & Kovaéevié, 1946; Arsi¢é, 1961; Spasié, 1961; Mijuskovi¢, 1963; Peri-
Si¢, 1970; Ristié, 1985). The composition of species, their taxonomic characteristics,
and the spectrum of host plants of these fungi have been studied in a series of papers
(Rankovic, 1988,1999; Rankovié & Comi¢, 1996, 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present paper a new agent of powdery mildew in Yugoslavia, viz. Erysiphe
hellebori, which parasitizes Helleborus odoratus, is described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following taxonomic characteristics of Erysiphe hellebori have been examined:
appearance and distribution of mycelium on the surface of the infected host plant
organs, diameter, shape and size of ascomata; number, size and structure of appendages;
number, shape and size of ascospores. The values obtained for these characteristics
are based in each case on the microscopic examination or measurement of 100 micro-
structures of the particular structures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material of the collections examined has been deposited at the Mycological Her-
barium of the Institute of Biology, Kragujevac (MHIB).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Plants of the species Helleborus odoratus L. and Vicia cassubica L. were artificially
inoculated with a suspension of spores of the fungus E. hellebori, as well as with a
suspension of spores of the fungus Erysiphe baeumleri (Magnus) U. Braun & S. Takam.
The experiment was performed in threefold repetition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 2. Erysiphye hellebori spec. nov. 1. Ascomata; 2. asci with ascospores; 3. appendages.#Figure*]

[@Artificial inoculation of H. odorus plants with spores of E. hellebori gave positive
results, whereas results of inoculating Vicia cassubica plants with spores of this fungus
were negative in all variants. In contrast to this, artificial inoculation with spores of
E. baeumleri gave negative results on H. odoratus, but positive results on V. cassubica.
It can be concluded that £. hellebori and E. baeumleri, in addition to morphological
differences, also differ with regard to their biological specialization, i.e. they parasitize
different plant species belonging to different families.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most closely related species is Coprinus subimpatiens M. Lange & A.H. Sm.
This species also has pleurocystidia, but grows terrestrial and has usually larger basidio-
carps. The pileocystidia in C. subimpatiens are larger, up to c. 140 µm long with (sub)-
cylindric neck, slightly broadened at apex in majority. The (sub)globose to ellipsoid
or vesiculose cheilocystidia are mixed with lageniform ones. Coprinus canistri also
reminds of C. congregatus (Bull.) Fr. in both macro- and microscopical characters,
but differs in the habitat preference because C. congregatus is a (strictly) coprophilous
species. Furthermore, C. canistri has smaller fruit-bodies, smaller and less narrow
spores (av. Q 2 1.70 in C. congregatus; av. Q « 1.70 in C. canistri), shorter pileocystidia
and smaller cheilo- and pleurocystidia. The quotient of the spores in all strains (11) of
C. congregatus studied by M. Lange (1953: 149) also exceeds 1.70 (1.75-1.95).#Misc-exposition*]

of macroscopical and microscopical characters, usually based on the authors own
observations. References are given to the material studied, which is conserved in the

[@(invalidly) by Métrod are examples of doubtful taxa, which may not exist in reality.
The lack of keys hampers identification, and makes it sometimes difficult to understand
the status of some newly described taxa. The publisher took a great financial risk in
producing this work, which probably is the reason for choosing the rather light and
cheap quality of the paper used in printing the plates, and the binding of the book,
which is a pity. The text volume is more robust, well-bound and easy to use.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In conclusion, however, one must state that this first volume of a total of five is
very promising. When finished, this compendium will be without any doubt the most
