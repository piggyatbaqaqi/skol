[@BASIDIOME DEVELOPMENT OF XEROMPHALINA CAMPANELLA
(TRICHOLOMATALES, BASIDIOMYCETES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@H. CLÉMENCON#Misc-exposition*]

[@The agaricoid Hymenomycete Xeromphalina campanella is exocarpic, apertopileate
and amphiblemate. Metablemas develop separately on the pileus and on the stipe, but
they do not form any kind of veil. The pileoblema becomes a gelatinous pileipellis,
and the cauloblema forms a hairy coating on the lower part of the stipe of the ma-
ture basidiomes. The hymenophoral trama is bidirectional in the gill rudiments, but
becomes more physalo-irregular at maturity and contains many narrow hyphae with
smooth or incrusted walls. The context of the stipe resembles a sarcodimitic structure,
but the thin-walled inflated cells are rarely fusiform, although they are frequently
gradually narrowed at one end. Between the physalohyphae, narrow, incrusted hyphae
and ramified connective hyphae occur in the stipe and in the pileus context. The
hyphae of the pileus of a young basidiome contain granular deposits of glycogen.#Abstract*]

[@The only note on the basidiome development of Xeromphalina campanella published
so far consists of a few lines and a single photograph at the end of a taxonomic paper by
Hintikka (1957). Since no trace of any kind of veil is visible in the photograph, Hintikka
cautiously concluded that the development is probably gymnocarpic. Singer (1965) was
more confident and stated that his X. austroandina is gymnocarpic, based on the “same
observations as indicated by Hintikka (1957) for X. campanella", without giving any
further details. Later, in his fundamental work on the genera of gill fungi, Singer (1986:
425) only mentioned the gymnocarpic development of X. campanella, giving credit to
Hintikka, but he did not mention his own observations on X. austroandina any more.
Since the reported observations are rather scanty and no other species of this genus
was studied, Watling & Turnbull (1998: 147) cautiously wrote that the development
is “not known”.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In March 2002 a large population of X. campanella basidiomes with primordia in all
developmental stages was found near Lausanne, Switzerland, which enabled a study of
the carpogenesis of this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Xeromphalina campanella (Batsch) Maire, * Les Liaises', north of Lausanne, Switzer-
land, 800 m above sea level; basidiomes densely gregarious on the black remains of
a stereoid fungus still attached to the fallen conifer trunk it was growing on. Leg. H.
Clémencon, 18.11.2002, coll. HC 02/009 (LAU).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Patches of the black, fibrous substrate were inspected with a dissecting microscope.
Excised substrate fragments bearing primordia were fixed for 25 h at 20-22°C in a solu-
tion of 0.9% formaldehyde and 1.25% glutaraldehyde in tap water (63 mg/L Ca++).#Misc-exposition*]
[@450 PERSOONIA Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@No vacuum was applied. The fixed material was transferred to cold methyl cellosolve
and carried over ethanol and propanol into butanol (Feder & O’Brien, 1968). It was
embedded in methacrylate, and the microtome sections were stained with aluminium-
zirconium-haematox ylin (Clémençon, 2000), basic fuchsine or with the tannin-iron reac-
tion for polysaccharides followed by haematoxylin as follows (all manipulations done
at room temperature of 20—22°C): a) Immerse the sections in a 3% tannin (tannic acid)
solution in distilled water for 30-40 minutes. Do not use gallic acid: it does not work.
b) Rinse in 3 or 4 charges of distilled water, about 5 minutes each. c) Immerse in 5%
iron(HI)chloride in distilled water for 20—40 minutes. The sections stain dark gray to
black, methacrylates remain unstained. d) Rinse in 2 or 3 charges of distilled water, about
5 minutes cach. c) Stain inO. 15€ ripened hematox ylin in distilled water for 15—20 minutes.
f) Rinse in 2 or 3 charges of distilled water, about 5 minutes each. g) Stabilise the stain
in calcium-rich tap water. If no hard tap water is available, use a 0.2% sodium bicarbo-
nate solution. h) Briefly rinse in distilled water, dry the sections on a hot bench or in an
oven, apply a synthetic resin (Entellan or a similar product) and a cover glass. As a result
the cell walls and gelatinous substances colour dark gray to black; some cell contents,
mainly protein crystals, are sometimes stained. Selected sections were photographed
with an Olympus DP11 digital camera mounted on a Leitz Orthoplan microscope. The
photographs were prepared for printing using Adobe Photoshop with a Macintosh G4
computer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@A summary of the early development of X. campanella is shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
Already the smallest nodulus is hairy (Figs. la, 2a). The Figs. lc—e and 2c—e show the
first developmental stages of the pileus, the growth of the metablema, and the begin-
ning of hyphal inflation. The smallest nodulus studied was 160 j/m wide and 150 µm
high and had a stalk 65 µm long and 35 zum thick, sunken in the substrate (Fig. 3). The
parallel hyphae of the stalk deviate and ramify at the base of the nodulus and become
subregularly arranged, still growing upward. The context in the centre of the nodulus
is slightly more irregular than in the peripheral parts. The hyphae of the surface of the
nodulus have a slightly thickened, light brown wall, staining deeper in the permanent#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 1. Selected stages of early primordium development. Living specimens photographed on the

[@mounts. The nodulus is moderately hairy from free hyphal ends. The small groove on
the top has no relation with the funnel-shape of the mature basidiome, as in other noduli
and young primordia studied it is lacking (c.g. Fig. 2a).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the next stage (Figs. 1b, 2b) a primordial shaft has begun its upward growth from
the top of the nodulus, changing the nodulus into a cone-shaped body with a rounded
base and a narrow, flat top (Fig. 4). The hyphae in the rudiment of the primordial shaft
are subregularly arranged in a general vertical orientation. The bulbous nodulus bears
many slightly thick-walled peripheral hyphae in an obliquely upward and outward orien-
tation, giving this part a hirsute appearance. These hairs constitute a noduloblema. The
cauloblema on the young primordial shaft is less developed, so this part is less hirsute
than the nodulus. The cauloblema and the noduloblema intergrade smoothly, forming
a continuous hairy coating. Most hyphal cells are binucleate (Figs. Sa, b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileus initial becomes visible as a short horizontal rim on top of the primordial
shaft (Figs. 1c, 2c, 6—8). It consists of more or less horizontal or obliquely downward
oriented hyphae. No prehymenial palisade is present at this stage. The pileoblema is
strongly developed and consists of greatly inflated hyphae. The top of the primordial shaft
is usually slightly convex because of the form of the pileoblema, but in many primor-
dia the future funnel-shaped pileus is already perceptible by the general orientation of
the thin generative hyphae of the context beneath the pileoblema (Fig. 8a). Under the
pileus initial the primordial shaft is composed of subregular generative hyphae with
a general vertical orientation, growing upward. This part is the stipe initial. In most
primordia it is covered with a cauloblema consisting of hyphal ends growing in an
oblique outward-upward direction. At the base, the hyphae of the nodulus started to
inflate (Figs. 6, 8b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileus margin grows outward and curves downward, and the underside of the
pileus initial becomes lined with a prehymenial palisade (Fig. 9). The pileoblema and
the cauloblema grow considerably and become a loose layer of erect hyphae, but the
prehymenial palisade remains naked. The stipe base consists of the nodulus with a char-
acteristic secondary structure composed of irregularly arranged and irregularly inflated
hyphae. Hyphal inflation is minimal in the stipe just below the pileus, and strong again
in the top part of the pileus, contributing here to the expansion of the cap.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During further development the pileus margin grows outward and curves downward,
but it never reaches the stipe surface (Figs. 2e, 10, 14). The pileoblema is most volu-
minous in the centre of the cap, where it forms a flat, inverted cone filling the funnel-
shaped pileus rudiment. Laterally the pileoblema forms a thin periclinal layer on the
pileus context. Although the transition from pileus context to pileoblema is gradual,
the funnel-shaped, denser pileus context is perceptible in Fig. 10. The prehymenial
palisade begins to produce meiotic basidia protruding considerably beyond the level
of the palisade cells (Figs. 10, 11). In the stipe context many hyphae swell and elongate
enormously and become multinucleate (Figs. 12, 13). Some hyphae end bluntly within
the stipe context (Fig. 13), but the end cells do not become acrophysalides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the growth of the pileus, the prehymenial palisade becomes arched, and indi-
vidual hyphae of the cauloblema may grow into the space between the pileus margin
and the stipe, but no ‘partial veil’ is formed. The pileoblema grows down laterally on#Misc-exposition*]
[@452 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@the pileus margin, its hyphae taking a periclinal orientation, but it does not join the
cauloblema (Fig. 14). It is not yet gelatinous. In this developmental stage the gill initials
are still lacking (Fig. 15).#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the pileus reaches a diameter of about 1 mm, gills begin to grow down from
its lower surface. The first gill trama is bidirectional with the vertical hyphae slightly
diverging (Fig. 16). Maturing basidia protrude considerably beyond the general level
of the hymenium. When the pileus reaches a diameter of about 3 mm, more pronounced
plectological differentiations take place. In the gill trama the hyphae of the mediostratum
begin to inflate (Figs. 17a, b), and the pileoblema changes its architecture. Its hyphae
become radially adherent to the pileus surface, and a gelatinous substance is formed,
so that the result is a radial ixocutis. Some hyphae of the pileoblema remain more or
less erect, and their often inflated end cells are sometimes called pileocystidia (Miller,
1968; Klan, 1984; Redhead, 1988). In the pileus context many cells now contain granu-
lar glycogen staining brown in iodine solutions and black with the tannin-iron reaction
(Fig. 18). In the hymenium well-differentiated pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia are
present, but the latter are by far the more numerous. The surface of the pleurocystidia
seems to be sticky enough to capture spores liberated by the basidia (Fig. 19). The
time of the first appearance of the hymenial cystidia is difficult to establish, since big,
prominent cells protruding beyond the level of the prehymenial palisade may develop
either into basidia or cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomes with a pileus 4—5 mm wide are fully differentiated. The mature gill trama
consists of irregular to bidirectional physalohyphae, and thin, brown-walled, irregularly
arranged hyphae with smooth or incrusted walls and almost no stainable cell content
(Figs. 20 a—d). A few very thin and extremely thin-walled hyphae rich in cytoplasm
occur in the gill trama and in the pileus context (Figs. 21a, b). The pileus is covered
by an ixocutis of radial hyphae bearing some erect hyphae and isolated inflated cells
called pileocystidia (Fig. 22). The ixocutis and the pileocystidia are the product of the
pileoblema. The stipe of the mature basidiome is composed of three hyphal types (Figs.
23a-c). Most prominent are the greatly inflated, multinucleate and highly vacuolated
physalohyphae. Their cells are sometimes cylindrical, sometimes elongate-conical at
one septum and cylindrical-blunt at the other (Figs. 23a, b), only rarely the cells are fusi-
form. Because of the conical structures Redhead (1987) called this context sarcodimitic.
Besides the physalohyphae many thin, approximately cylindrical hyphae with brown
incrusted walls, and thin, highly ramified, colourless connecting hyphae are present in
the stipe context (Fig. 23c). The context of the pileus has the same structure.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Using the traditional terminology, the development of X. campanella should be called
gymnocarpic, as did Hintikka (1957) and Singer (1986). The primordia lack any kind of
veil, universal or partial, the pileipellis does not extend over the pileus margin toward
the stipe, and the pileus margin itself never touches the stipe surface. Thus no closed gill
cavity ever exists. But this simple term does not take into account the massive devel-
opment of metablemas on the stipe and on the pileus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cauloblemas and pileoblemas often produce a partial veil, c.g. in Panus tigrinus (Küh-
ner, 1925) and Boletinus cavipes (Kühner, 1926), and the difference with X. campanella
concerns only the degree of the growth of the metablemas: a slightly more extended
growth of either metablema would produce a partial veil, and, as a consequence, the
developmental type of X. campanella would change from gymnocarpy to secondary
angiocarpy, creating the illusion of a fundamentally different carpogenesis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the terminology proposed by Clémençon (1997), X. campanella is exocarpic
since the primordium does not develop within a primordial shaft, amphiblemate since
a pileoblema and a cauloblema are produced independently and never form a partial
veil, and apertopileate since the pileus margin never touches the stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Xeromphalina campanella is a good example to illustrate the fact that ‘metablema’
is not synonymous with ‘emanated veil’, since in this fungus the pileoblema and the
cauloblema independently develop into a pileipellis and into a hirsute stipe covering,
respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the hymenophoral trama in the genus Xeromphalina is controversially
described in the literature. According to Singer (1986: 424) the gill trama of mature
basidiomes “is regular, its hyphae close, rather voluminous, subparallel and axiallarly
arranged ..."; where ‘axial’ means “... the hyphae run ... from the plane of attachment
to the pileus down to the edges of the hymenophore ..." (Singer, 1986: 56). Klan (1984:
215) confusingly writes "Hymenophoral trama regular, composed of irregular to loosely
interwoven thin-walled hyphae ...", and Miller (1968: 159) describes the gill trama#Misc-exposition*]
[@470 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@“of loosely interwoven to loosely parallel, thin- to thick-walled hyphae”. According to
Redhead (1988) the “lamellar trama hyphae [are] bidirectionally arranged”, using the
concept of the bidirectional gill trama introduced by Clémençon (1982). In primordia
of X. campanella the gill trama is bidirectional at first but becomes irregular at maturity,
a final condition best observed in parahymenial sections. It is conceivable that some
species conserve the bidirectional arrangement of the hyphae longer than the species
studied here, explaining the wording used by Redhead (1988). Horak (1979) and Watling
& Turnbull (1998) remain silent about the structure of the hymenophoral trama.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Intracellular glycogen has been observed in several agaricoid fungi, e.g. in Coprinus
cinereus (Madelin, 1960; Matthews & Niederpruem, 1972), C. trisporus (Clémençon,
1997), and Lepista flaccida (Clémençon, unpublished observation), so the presence of
this polysaccharide in X. campanella is not surprising.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three species of Lactarius from Mexico were studied: L. deceptivus, L. luteolus and
L. rimosellus. The latter two concern new records from western Mexico and from the
Gulf of Mexico region, respectively, and the former was found on new localities. A
study of their respective type collections and those of L. tomentosomarginatus and
L. echinatus was made in order to support the identity of Mexican specimens. Based
on à morphological study we propose reducing L. tomentosomarginatus to synonymy
of L. deceptivus and agree with other authors that L. echinatus is conspecific with
L. luteolus. Descriptions and illustrations are given of the three Mexican records.#Abstract*]

[@Key words: Russulales, taxonomy, ectomycorrhizal fungi, type studies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The study of the genus Lactarius in Mexico indicates that Mexican Lactarius mycota is
more similar to that reported from the USA (Hesler & Smith, 1979), while the percentage
of taxa described from other continents is lower (Montoya & Bandala, 2002). However,
new undescribed Lactarius species, either from temperate or tropical sites, have also
been found (Montoya & Bandala, 2003). Other new species are currently under study.
To confirm the identity of Mexican collections of Lactarius it has become necessary to
restudy types of several selected taxa, which include those of species poorly known since
their respective descriptions from northern areas in America, and record their range of
distribution as far as this latitude. Extended descriptions and illustrations based on Mexi-
can material are given here, as well as data after comparison with the type specimens.
Lactarius luteolus Peck, L. rimosellus Peck and L. deceptivus Peck are taxa documented
from other areas, but up to now the first two are unknown in Mexico. Lactarius decep-
tivus deserved additional study on its ecological distribution and variation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopic descriptions are based on fresh material. Colour codes indicated in the
descriptions follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). Microscopic structures are described
from hand sections of revived tissues; their measurements and colours were observed
in 396 KOH, except for basidiospores, which were studied in Melzer's reagent. The
following notations are used: RM = range of means of length x width; QM = length/
width ratio of spores, indicated as a range in n collections. The methods followed to
make measurements and SEM analyses are those used by Montoya & Bandala (2003).
Herbarium acronyms are according to Holmgren et al. (1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius deceptivus is a well-known species from North America. It is widely spread
in the eastern regions, from Canada across the east coast of USA to the Gulf of Mexico

[@Homola & Czapowskyj, 1981; Montoya et al., 1990; Phillips, 1991; Montoya & Ban-
dala, 1996; Bessette et al., 1997). It is a distinctive species characterized by white to
cream-coloured basidiomes which stain brown, surface fibrillose-squamulose with age,
distinctly involute margin of pileus which is cottony in young stages, velvety stipitipel-
lis, white latex which is invariable in colour but stains the cut surfaces brown, acrid
taste and ellipsoid basidiospores with a verrucose ornamentation pattern (Peck, 1885;
Burlingham, 1908; Hesler & Smith, 1979; Montoya et al., 1990; Montoya & Bandala,
1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the examined specimens, those of Mc Vaugh from South Mexico were found at
MICH labelled as L. tomentosomarginatus Hesler & A.H. Sm., a close relative of L. decep-
tivus (Hesler & Smith, 1979). Basidiomes of these collections, however, show the same
morphologic variability (macro- and microscopic) as was observed in the examined
collections of L. deceptivus, including the type specimen. Hesler & Smith (1979) used
the following set of characters to distinguish L. romentosomarginatus from L. deceptivus:
(i) the low basidiospore ornamentation [0.2—0.7 µm in L. tomentosomarginatus vs
0.5-1(-1.5) µm in L. deceptivus]; (ii) basidiospores slightly shorter [9-11 x 7-8.5 µm
vs 9-1%-13) x 7.5-9 µm]; (iii) the crowded, bifurcate and narrow lamellae; and (iv) the
pileipellis without cracks.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our analysis revealed that all specimens studied exhibit a wide variation regarding these
features, which does not allow us to recognize discontinuity among the samples. Within a
basidiome there may be variation in the height of the basidiospore ornamentation. Under
SEM Peck’s collection exhibited basidiospores with isolated verrucae, 0.3-1.1(-1.5) µm
high. The verrucae are somewhat variable in shape (even within a single basidiospore),
often appearing as rods, papillas or cylindrical, conical, broad or rounded verrucae, but these
fit a consistent verrucose pattern. A similar variation was found in the Homola specimens
from Maine and the other specimens considered (Figs. 1,6, 7, 9). The height of the spore
ornamentation in the three Mexican specimens labelled as L. tomentosomarginatus shows
a range of 0.25-1.1 µm (measured under SEM), meanwhile the type collection (from
USA, Nimke 508) even shows a wider range, up to 1.13(—1.5) µm (Figs. 2. 8). On the other
hand, our data on the basidiospore size (Table 1) revealed only minor differences, which
we consider of no taxonomic value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomes in Peck's Sandlake material exhibit crowded to close lamellae, which
agree with the variation of the arrangement observed in the type of L. tomentosomar-
ginatus. Among the three collections of Mc Vaugh, some basidiomes even have broader
and more distant lamellae than in Peck’s specimen of L. deceptivus, similar to the wide
variation observed in other Mexican collections. Furthermore, the pileus cuticle tends to
crack with the expansion of the pileus and this cracking is probably also influenced by
environmental conditions. At any rate, the microscopic structure of pileipellis is similar
among all the samples examined (Fig. 5). The holotype of L. romentosomarginatus (Nimke
508) is composed of young basidiomes which are of small to medium size, with the pileus
margin still involute and a mostly uncracked pileipellis, except for some specimens of
which the pileipellis is somewhat cracked towards the margin. The lectotype material of
L. deceptivus exhibits a somewhat wider macroscopic variation due to the different stages
of development of the basidiomes represented in this collection (but includes basidiomes
similar in size to those of the type of L. tomentosomarginatus). The pileus cuticle in the
individuals of this latter collection is scarcely cracked in younger basidiomes, and cracked
into fibrillose patches in the older ones.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a result of these morphological studies we conclude that the basidiomes of the
studied material show the morphologic variation of a single taxon, and therefore we inter-
prete the differences used by Hesler & Smith (1979) to distinguish L. deceptivus from
L. tomentosomarginatus as representing part of such variation. Lactarius tomentoso-
marginatus is in our opinion a synonym of L. deceptivus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius deceptivus is represented in Peck's herbarium (NYS) by the collection
from Sandlake mentioned above which is recorded as the type material. This collection,
labelled as ‘type’, was gathered by Peck in August (year not indicated), and is accom-
panied by drawings of fresh basidiomes, and also by a handwritten note by H.D. House
(who succeeded Peck as State Botanist at NYS Museum): “... Peck did not designate a
type collection or locality for L. deceptivus, hence the mounted material from Sandlake,
accompanied by drawings and spore print may — perhaps not? (these two words not
clearly legible) — serve the purpose of a type ...". Also, it is accompanied by a study of
the microscopic features of the basidiomes made by G. Bills in1982 with the indication
of being the type specimen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several authors (Saccardo, 1887; Burlingham, 1908; Kauffman, 1918; Hesler &
Smith, 1979; Walleyn et al., 1996), including databases (Type Specimen Database of
the New York State Museum Mycological Collections, N YS; Russulales News Website)
recorded the publication of Peck (1885) as the original description of L. deceptivus. The
epithet in Peck's report, written as "L. deceptivus Peck", does not have an indication
of the status as new species (i.c., sp. nov. or n. sp.), as clearly stated for other species
described by him in the same publication (e.g. Russula basifurcata, n. sp., Polyporus
crispellus, n. sp., L. varius, n. sp.). The information provided by Peck in that work, as
stated by House in his notes, did not include a specimen nor a locality but only a date
(July-September) and habitat (woods and open places, especially under hemlock trees).
We have not found any previous description of L. deceptivus by Peck, and the material
from Sandlake matches the description of 1885. This original material supports validly
the lectotypification by Hesler & Smith (1979).#Misc-exposition*]

filamentous caulocystidia, 100-450 x 4—7.2 µm, with attenuated apex, arising from a

[@In the taxonomic arrangement followed by Hesler & Smith (1979), L. deceptivus was
included in subgenus Lactiflui (Burl.) Hesler & A.H. Sm. (as Lactifluus, cf. Verbeken,
2001), sect. Albati (Bat.) Singer, the same section in which Singer (1986) treated it but
without a subgeneric status. Verbeken (1998) accepted sect. A/bati due to the absence of
a pseudoparenchymatous layer in the pileipellis of its members and transferred it to subg.
Lactariopsis (Henn.) R. Heim. Hesler & Smith (1979) and Bon (1980) argued that the
pileipellis structure is a reliable character that suggests natural relationships, but in this
context the stipitipellis structure, as part of the basidiome dermis should be considered
as well. Taking this into account, L. deceptivus, which has different pileipellis, i.e. a
loose cutis, but has a stipitipellis (a trichodermis composed of thick-walled elements)
comparable to that observed in other A/bati, can be included in this section and probably
represents a subsection. A cladistic analysis, however, should reveal more information
about this. We share the opinion of Hesler & Smith (1979), Verbeken (1998) and Basso
(1999) in considering the A/bati a distinct section, but as subg. Lactariopsis embraces
members with more than one kind of pileipellis structure, or even with a pseudopa-
renchymatous subpellis (L. velutissimus Verbeken) (Verbeken, 1996) we provisionally
consider L. deceptivus and sect. Albati in subg. Lactiflui, following Hesler & Smith
(1979) and Basso (1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The documentation regarding the distribution of L. deceptivus in Mexico (Montoya
et al., 1990, Montoya & Bandala 1996) as well as the records treated here, indicate that this
species is widely spread in the country, from north to south (Guerrero, Oaxaca & Chiapas),
associated with Quercus and also with conifers. Quercus oleoides Schltdl. & Cham. repre-
sents one of the most important phytobionts associated with Lactarius in Mexico. Trees
of Q. oleoides have a similar distribution as L. deceptivus as well as that of other common
Lactarius species in Mexico such as L. hygrophoroides and L. indigo, from the northeast
to the south of the country, and also through Central America. Singer et al. (1983) also
recorded the two latter species in association with Q. oleoides in Costa Rica, and they
even cited L. hygrophoroides associated with Q. oleoides in northern South America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lalli & Pacioni (1992) treated L. echinatus as a synonym of L. luteolus and we agree
with this synonymy. The study of the respective holotypes indeed confirms this. They
share a similar basidiospore range (RM = 8 x 6.4 µm, QM z 1.3 in L. Iuteolus; RM —
8x 6 µm, QM = 1.4 in Z. echinatus), pileipellis a trichodermis and septate hymenial
elements. Hesler & Smith (1979) and Singer (1990), however, maintained L. echinatus
as an autonomous species. The specimen collected in Mexico (Tamaulipas: Gómez
Farias, 21.X11.1988, F1080303, leg. J. García & G. Mueller, F) and determined by
Singer (1990) as L. echinatus was also examined. This material shows a different set
of characters which indicates that it belongs to a different taxon in subg. Lactarius
(Heilmann-Clausen et al., 1998; Basso, 1999). The present state of preservation of the
material, however, makes study difficult. Future collections will help to complement
the information on presence of other representatives of this group in Mexico. Therefore,
the presence of L. luteolus (as L.echinatus) in Northeast Mexico, as suggested by Singer
(1990), could not be verified.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius rimosellus (sect. Olentes Bat., subg. Russularia (Fr.) Kauffm.) is distinc-
tive because of its basidiome colour and by the rimose-areolate pileus in combination
with the verrucose ornamentation pattern of the basidiospores. The present state of the
type specimen makes it difficult to revive the tissues and to study the pileipellis. The
pileipellis of collection Smith 84515 (which Hesler & Smith (1979) considered to be
conspecific) was studied and fitted the description of our Mexican material: it agrees
with the hymeno-epithelium type described by Heilmann-Clausen et al. (1998). Other
macro- and microscopical characters of the Mexican material are in accordance with
both collections from the USA.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This long awaited manual gives cultural descriptions of 223 specific and infra-specific
taxa of Phoma (Coelomycetes). Fungi of this genus are common, but have always been
difficult to identify. But now this book will make identification easier. It provides line
drawings and keys for the identification of common pathogenic and saprotrophic spe-
cies of Phoma in vitro, with references to additional diagnostic literature, representative
cultures and documentation of the numerous synonyms (1,146 in total) formerly used in
the mycological and phytopathological literature. Part of the book has been published
before in the series ‘Contributions towards a monograph of Phoma’, also partly in
Persoonia. Most of the Phoma-species in this book are widespread in western Europe.
but they are often also recorded elsewhere in the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book starts with an introduction of 7 pages, the nomenclator of the genus and its
sections of 3 pages, an overview of the generic characters of 2 pages, an overview of
the methods used for identification (5 pages). A key to the sections based on characters
in vitro takes 2 pages, and notes on adjacent genera 6 pages. The rest of the book is
composed of the 9 sections which are distinguished in Phoma. Per section a descrip-
tion and notes are given, followed by a key to the species, a list of hosts of the species.
Per species the teleomorph and synonyms are given, together with a full description in
vitro. Notes on ecology and distribution complete the description.#Misc-exposition*]

2004; Singer et al., 2003, 2004, 2005) is continued with the application of electron micro-

tosa collected by Meylan and the type of Lamproderma longifilum H. Neubert, Nowotny

[@Several works on the revision of nivicolous species described by Kowalski have
already been published (Singer et al., 2005), in which various taxa have been synon-

Lepidoderma aggregatum with L. chailletii (Moreno et al., 2004) and Lepidoderma
didermoides with L. chailletii (Moreno et al., 2004).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It has been necessary and important to carry out these studies in order to establish the
taxonomic position of the species, which were inadequately described and thus obtain
new information essential for understanding their taxonomy and applying it to previous
chorological and ecological studies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collected material was studied with a binocular microscope and, after mounting in
Hoyer's medium, with a Nikon (Optiphot) microscope. Spore measurements were made
under the oil immersion objective and include surface structures such as spines or
warts.#Misc-exposition*]
[@486 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken in the University of
Alcalá de Henares using a Zeiss DSM-950. SEM-preparation was made as sporocarps
were rehydrated in concentrated ammonium hydroxide (28-30%) for 30 minutes, dehy-
drated in aqueous ethanol (70%) for 30 minutes, fixed for 2 hours in pure ethylene glycol
dimethyl ether (= 1, 2-dimethoxymethane) and finally immersed in pure acetone for at
least 2 hours followed by critical point drying and sputtering with gold-palladium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The terminology of the spore-producing stages follows Dórfelt & Marx (1990) and
Lado & Pando (1997). The spore wall ornamentation as seen in the SEM is described
according to the terminology proposed by Rammeloo (19752, b). The abbreviations for

spinulose. With SEM the spore ornamentation is composed of dense baculae of regular
distribution (Figs. 4, 5).#Description*]

[@Observations. The material designated as type by Kowalski is conserved in a small
carton with a piece of card at the bottom to which a small piece of bark is attached (2.5

abundant remains of hypothallus where sporocarps had been broken off or lost.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Meylan (1921) proposed the new variety Comatricha suksdorfii var. aggregata
because of the tufted sporocarps which are contiguous for most of their length, but
free at their bases and apices. Subsequently, Kowalski (1973), after comparing the
type of C. suksdorfii with his own collections found that his specimens did not fit
this species, but resembled Meylan’s type of C. suksdorfii var. aggregata. He pointed#Misc-exposition*]

[@out that the differences between C. suksdorfii var. suksdorfii and C. suksdorfii var.
aggregata were greater than those indicated by Meylan. Kowalski distinguished the
former variety by its “widely scattered sporangia 3—4 mm long and stipes about 4 mm
tall" and the latter by its "densely aggregated sporangia 1.5—3 mm long and stipes
about 1 mm tall". He considered these differences sufficient to treat C. suksdorfii var.
aggregata as a different species which he called C. alpina, as the epithet aggregata was
already in use by Farr (1957) for another Comatricha.#Misc-exposition*]
[@488 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@Within the scope of the revision of types of nivicolous Myxomycetes that is pres-
ently carried out, we have restudied the type of C. alpina. Surprisingly, apart from
observing confluent sporocarps forming pseudoaethalia, we have observed that the
capillitia of the individual sporocarps are partially fused and continuous. Thus, C. alpi-
na is in reality a Symphytocarpus. Within this genus it matches S. confluens (Cooke
& Ellis) Ing & Nann.-Bremek., due to its rigid capillitium forming a wide-meshed net
with abundant spiny free ends and the presence of the typical rounded plates described
above, as indicated by Lister (1911) and Neubert et al. (2000) for this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Symphytocarpus was proposed by Ing & Nannenga-Bremekamp (1967)
in order to group together some species that they segregated from the genera Amauro-
chaete, Comatricha and Stemonitis and which are characterized mainly by their sporo-
carps, whose capillitia fuse together to form pseudoaethalia. These authors already
indicated that “perhaps C. suksdorfii var. aggregata should go here too, but as we have
not seen specimens of this variety, we cannot decide now”. Later, Neubert et al. (2000)
came to the same conclusion, studying Meylan’s type but not associating it with
Symhytocarpus confluens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Symphytocarpus confluens is a very common species that is cited in literature. It is
not nivicolous and, as Schnittler & Novozhilov (1996) indicated recently, “the solid
inner wood is the microhabitat of the plasmodia".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Observations. The type material is kept in a box at the bottom of which are glued
five pieces of bark, three large and two smaller ones; one of the small pieces does not
contain any material, but the others do. However, only on one of them the sporocarps
are well-formed and not collapsed or parasitized by fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comatricha anastomosans is characterized by its capillitium formed by flexuous and
sinuous threads that expand and intermingle with the capillitium of adjacent sporocarps
which, however, do not fuse together and by its peridium that persists at the base of the
sporotheca to form a basal cup.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kowalski (1972) placed this species near the genus Amaurochaete on basis of its
sporocarps having interconnected capillitia that resemble pseudoaethalia. Comatricha
anastomosans can clearly be separated from Amourochaete by its sporocarps being
visibly discrete, while species of the genus Amaurochaete have either true aethalia or
pseudoaethalia where it is difficult or impossible to distinguish individual sporocarps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kowalski also considered C. suksdorfii to be the most closely related species in the
genus. These two species, apart from sharing the mountainous habitat, have gregarious,
black, cylindrical sporocarps, with a long columella that almost reaches the apex of the
sporotheca and blackish spores of similar dimensions (11—12 jem diameter in C. ana-
stomosans and 10-12 µm in C. suksdorfii). However, they can be distinguished by
the peridium, capillitium and spore ornamentation. In C. anastomosans the peridium
always persists at the base as a cup, the capillitium intermingles with that of adjacent
sporocarps and the spores are spinulose with light microscope. In C. suksdorfii the peri-
dium is entirely evanescent and never forms a basal cup, the capillitium of individual
sporocarps is never intermingled and the spore ornamentation appears warted with
light microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nannenga-Bremekamp (1974) followed by Yamamoto (1998), ascribe to C. filamen-
tosa a 3—4 mm long stalk, which does not coincide with Meylan's description of this
species (Meylan, 1921). Some years later, Neubert et al. (2000) concluded that these
authors had confused C. filamentosa with C. alta.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Once again, Kowalski (1975), after studying the type of C. filamentosa, suggested
that his C. anastomosans could be a synonym or a robust variety of C. anastomosans.
The only differences observed by Kowalski (1975) were the height of the sporocarps
(1-2 mm in C. filamentosa and 2—6 mm in C. anastomosans) and the absence of a pale
zone in the spores of C. filamentosa. As described below, there is a difference in the
height of the sporocarps, but in both species a pale zone on the spores can be observed
that corresponds to a germination pore.#Misc-exposition*]

observations (1975), without studying their types.#Misc-exposition*]

of flexuous and sinuous threads forming a net that expands and intermingles with the
capillitium-threads of adjacent sporocarps without fusing together, by its short stalk
(0.5—1 mm) and by the peridium persisting as a basal cup. This species was first deter-
mined by Meylan as C. alta, as can be seen on the labels on the boxes and subsequently
corrected to C. filamentosa. Comatricha alta is close to this species but differs princi-
pally in its longer stalk (reaching 5 mm) and entirely evanescent peridium. As already
mentioned, Neubert et al. (2000) considered C. filamentosa synonymous with C. alta,
but they did not study type material.#Misc-exposition*]

the groups of sporocarps. Stalk up to 1.5 mm long, cylindrical to laterally compressed,
tapered slightly towards the apex and somewhat widened towards the base, longitudi-
nally striate, with a fibrous base, dark reddish. Peridium membranous, persistent, golden
iridescent, with darker maculae; irregular dehiscence into large flakes. Columella a
continuation of the stalk and concolorous, up to 2/3 of the height of the sporotheca,
with an obtuse apex. Capillitium formed by flexuous and sinuous threads of 1.5-2 µm
in diameter, dark brown, with main branches up to 5 µm in diameter originating along
the whole length of the columella, branched and anastomosed, forming a dense net,
with few free ends. Spores dark brown in mass, violaceous brown with transmitted
light, globose, 11-12 µm in diameter, spinulose, with a clearer zone of variable size
(germination pore). With SEM the spore ornamentation is composed of dense baculae
of regular distribution (Figs. 19, 20).#Description*]

C. fusiformis, which has the type of spore ornamentation consisting of baculae with

[@CONCLUSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Following the study of the type material of C. suksdorfii Ellis & Everh. var. aggregata
Meyl. (1921: 455) we consider C. alpina synonymous with Symphytocarpus confluens
(Cooke & Ellis) Ing & Nann.-Bremek. (Figs. 1-5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As Kowalski (1975) has already suggested, we agree that C. anastomosans “is very
close, if not identical, with C. filamentosa". There are only minimal differences in the
height of the sporocarps, 2-3.5 mm in C. anastomosans (with the capillitum not ex-
panded) and 1.5—3.5 mm in C. filamentosa (with the capillitium expanded) and there are
no significant differences in the dimensions of the sporothecae. We have observed that
the sporothecae of C. anastomosans are 1-2.5 x 1-1.5 mm (capillitium not expanded)
and of C. filamentosa 1-1.5 x 1 mm (capillitium expanded). We have to point out that
the dimensions of the sporocarps of these species are difficult to measure as a result of
the tendency of the capillitium to expand. As there are no other significant differences,
synonymy of these species is proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We propose the synonymy of Lamproderma longifilum with C. anastomosans. When
Neubert et al. (1989) described L. /ongifilum, they noted its similarity to C. anastomo-
sans. These species are separated, according to these authors, because C. anastomosans
has cylindrical sporothecae, each with a columella that is markedly tapered and reaches
almost to the apex, where it gives rise to the capillitium with few free ends. In L. /ongi-
filum the sporothecae are globose, the columella is shorter and is only slightly tapered
or blunt, the capillitium has free ends and the peridium shows dark spots.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Neubert et al. (2000), after consulting Meyer who studied Kowalski's American
material of C. anastomosans, observed similarities in the microscopy of the two species
and proposed the synonymy of L. /ongifilum with C. anastomosans. We agree with this
view, as the differences between these species do not justify their separation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@496 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@The distinct spots, present in all of Neubert’s collections of L. /ongifilum that we have
studied, are not present in C. anastomosans and C. filamentosa, as these specimens were
very mature and lacked sporothecae with a complete peridium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE BASIDIOME ONTOGENY OF
CHAMONIXIA CAESPITOSA (SEQUESTRATE BOLETACEAE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@H. CLÉMENÇON#Misc-exposition*]

[@Institut d’Ecologic, Université de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland
E-mail: Heinz.Clemencon@bluewin.ch#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description of basidiome development of Chamonixia caespitosa made by
Eduard Fischer during the first quarter of the last century is extended, based on a
new investigation of the original permanent mounts. This puffball-like fungus is
exocarpic, claustropileate and amphicleistoblemate. A hymeniform palisade on the
primordial stipe becomes partly covered and obliterated by the pileus margin and
an amphicleistoblema. The morphological data confirm the molecular-taxonomic
position of Chamonixia in the Boletaceae.#Abstract*]

[@Chamonixia caespitosa Rolland is a puffball-like Basidiomycete with a finely tomen-
tose peridium turning blue when bruised. Molecular analyses showed that the genus
Chamonixia has phylogenetic affinities with the boletes (Bruns et al., 1998; Kretzer &
Bruns, 1999),#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1925 the Swiss mycologist Eduard Fischer published a description of the fruit-
body development of C. caespitosa based on thick sections that he made from material
collected by E. Soehner (1922, as Hymenogaster caerulescens Soehner). He strongly
emphasised the resemblance of the early stages of Chamonixia caespitosa with early
stages of gymnocarpic agarics with a free pileus margin, such as Gymnopus dryophilus
(Collybia dryophila), and he explained the puffball-like appearance of the mature basid-
iome with the fact that the pileus margin grows towards the primordial stipe and
fuses with it, while the hymenophore, instead of being regular as in agarics, becomes
sponge-like (Fig. 1). Therefore, Fischer (1925) called the development of C. caespi-
tosa gymnocarpic, whereas Reijnders (1963), who based his judgement exclusively on
the description made by Fischer, called it pilangiocarpic. Fischer described and made
drawings of numerous hyphae growing out of the pileus surface and pileus margin, but
neither he nor Reijnders (1963) took this fact into consideration when assigning this
fungus to a developmental type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this paper, the presence of a pileoblema, a cauloblema, a hymeniform palisade on
the primordial stipe, and an irregular context in the primordial stipe base are described,
using the sections made by Fischer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eduard Fischer left a legacy of 12 unstained permanent mounts that are conserved
at the Institute of Plant Sciences (formerly Botanical Institute) of the University of
Bern, Switzerland. The slides were examined with bright field microscopy and photo-
graphed with an Olympus D11 digital camera mounted on a Zeiss Orthoplan microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The photographs were adjusted for printing with Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh
G4 computer. Since Fischer's sections are thick, it was difficult to make useful photo-
graphs, but the details necessary for a reappraisal are still visible, albeit not in optimal
quality.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hyphae growing out from the pileus margin and pileus surface are readily visible
(Figs. 2, 4). In older primordia, hyphae are also growing out from the stipe surface, but
Fischer (1925) did not mention them. The hyphae on the upper part of the stipe grow
obliquely upward to meet the hyphae growing down from the pileus margin (Fig. 4), but
the hyphae of the lower part of the stipe grow more or less horizontally and intertwine
frequently. At maturity, a tomentose layer originating on the pileus and on the stipe
covers the entire basidiome.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Inspection of Fischer's slides reveals the presence of a hymeniform layer on the stipe
(Figs. 2, 3). It extends from within the narrow fold formed by the pileus margin to almost
down to the base and becomes buried under the involute pileus margin and the tomentose
layer of outgrowing hyphae. Fischer (1925) does not mention this hymeniform layer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The context in the base of the stipe is composed of slightly inflated and irregularly
arranged hyphae (Fig. 3). This context contrasts with the subregular, vertical hyphae
of the stipe, as indicated in the drawings by Fischer (1925), but this author did not pay
any attention to it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fischer's drawings of the hyphae growing out of the pileus and stipe strongly sug-
gest an emanated veil (Reijnders, 1948, 1963). It is therefore surprising that Reijnders
(1963) did not pay any attention to it. Moreover, Reijnders (1963) specifically affirmed
that there is no marginal veil in C. caespitosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1997 Clémençon introduced the concept of metablemas formed by hyphae growing
out of almost any part of a basidiome. Metablemas are not synonymous with emanated
veils, since the final organs formed by them may become not only veils, but also surface
layers such as pileipelles and stipitipelles. The hyphae growing out of the pileus and
stipe of C. caespitosa are a pileoblema and a cauloblema, respectively. Since the hyphae
of the two blemas intermingle at the level of the pileus margin and form a continuous,
veil-like layer, Chamonixia caespitosa is covered by an amphicleistoblema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One year after Fischer's publication, Kühner (1926a, b) published his studies on the
basidiome development of two boletes, Suillus grevillei (as Suillus flavus) and Boletinus
cavipes (Fig. 5). The pilei of both boletes curve down toward the stipe to form a second-
ary prehymenial cavity. In Boletinus cavipes the pileus margin does not quite touch the
stipe, but the small distance left is bridged by an amphicleistoblema. In Suillus grevillei
the pileus margin touches the stipe, and a pileocleistoblema grows down from the pileus
onto the stipe. The secondary cavity of both species is lined with a hymeniform layer
that also covers the surface of the stipe, extending down well beyond the level of the
pileus margin. Part of the hymeniform layer becomes buried under the pileus margin
and the cleistoblema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 3. Palisade layer on the lower part of the primordial stipe (left) and irregular context in the stipe
base, indicating the presence of a nodulus. From the small primordium in Fig. 1.#Figure*]

[@Comparing the carpogenesis of Chamonixia with that of the two boletes, we find
four developmental steps in Chamonixia identical with those described from Suillus
and Boletinus: An involute pileus margin forming a secondary cavity: a cleistoblema:
à hymeniform layer extending from the cavity onto the stipe; and an overgrowth of part
of this layer by the pileus margin and the cleistoblema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is still another developmental similarity between Chamonixia and the two
boletes. The irregularly arranged, inflated hyphae in the stipe base of Chamonixia indi-
cate the presence of a nodulus from which a shaft of subregularly arranged hyphae grows
up and forms the primordial stipe. Thus, in the terminology of Clémençon (1997, 2004)
Chamonixia is epinodular and exocarpic like Suillus grevillei and Boletinus cavipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conclusion: The development of C. caespitosa is remarkably similar to that of the two
boletes, confirming the taxonomic conclusion based on the molecular studies mentioned
above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A NEW SPECIES OF GYMNOPILUS (CORTINARIACEAE)
FROM SANDY SOILS IN PINUS FORESTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@A. ORTEGA! & F. ESTEVE-RAVENTÓS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new species Gymnopilus arenophilus A. Ortega & Esteve-Rav. is described. It is
characterized by its particular habitat in sandy, sometimes burned, soils of thermophil-
ous Pinus forests. Macroscopically G. arenophilus resembles G. penetrans, from which
it differs in the larger spores and the scarcely bitter taste. Microscopically G. areno-
philus reminds of G. fulgens, with which it has probably been mistaken in the past.
The latter species has very different macroscopical features, spore ornamentation
and a paludicolous habitat. A discussion of European and some non-European related
species is also given.#Abstract*]

[@Gymnopilus arenophilus has been found in large amounts in the province of Sevilla
(Spain) in the last years, during a research project carried out by one of us (A.O.) to
compile and list the mycobiota of the macromycetes growing in an area close to the
river Guadiamar basin. This territory suffered in April 1998 an important ecological
damage. caused by a toxic mineral waste after the breaking of a mining pond (Cabezudo
et al., 2003; Ortega, 2003). One of the most interesting areas of study in this territory
has been the Mediterranean plant communities which develop on sandy soils, such as
the thermo-mediterranean xero-psammophilous cork-oak forests (Myrto communis-
Querceto suberis halimietoso halimifolii S. (Cabezudo et al., 2003)). These cork-oak
forests, which always develop in acid soils, are often wide open forests, accompanied
by pines (Pinus pinea) and evergreen oaks (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota). with the pres-
ence of ‘jaras’ (Cistus spp.) in those more degraded spots. Previous contributions to the
knowledge of the mycobiota of these areas were made by Esteve-Raventós et al. (2001),
Migliozzi & Ortega (2001) and Ortega & Esteve-Raventós (2003; in prep.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gómez-Busutil et al. (1996) studied the mycobiota of agarics which develop in sandy
continental soils of Pinus pinaster forests in Segovia (Central Spain), and recorded a
species of Gymnopilus P. Karst. which was identified as G. fulgens (J. Favre & Maire)
Singer, growing on sandy soil, sometimes amongst charcoal of Pinus debris.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A thorough study of all these collections has confirmed their conspecificity, and also
showed that the name G. fulgens cannot be applied to them; a scanning of the literature
of Gymnopilus available to the authors has revealed that this new species has probably
been mistaken with G. fulgens by some European authors. Other contributions concern-
ing American taxa (e. g., Hesler, 1969; Singer, 1969; Dennis, 1970; Pegler & Fiard, 1983;

[@508 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@The most important diagnostic characters of this new species are its large spores and
arenicolous, subcarbonicolous habitat. There are not many species of Gymnopilus reach-
ing the spore measurements of G. arenophilus in Europe, especially in those devoid of
a membranous annulus (subgenus Gymnopilus, according to Hesler, 1969 and Bon &
Roux, 2002). Ina recent classification of Gymnopilus proposed by Guzmän-Dävalos &
Guzman (1995), G. arenophilus would have to be included within section Macrospori
Guzm.-Dáv. (species with spores 8—11(—12) µm in length).#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, according to its macroscopical characters, G. arenophilus resembles
G. penetrans (Fr.) Murrill sensu lato (incl. G. sapineus (Fr.) Maire and G. hybridus
(Bull.) Maire, see Hgiland (1990)); in fact, both species may share the brown-ferrugi-
neous spots on the lamellae, and show similar colours, pileus surface and habit. Gym-
nopilus penetrans, however, is strictly lignicolous, normally fructifying on conifers logs
or wood chips, its taste is strongly bitter and the spores are much smaller, measuring
7-8.5(-9) x 4.5-5.5 µm (Fig. 1f). Also, pleurocystidia are commonly present in C. pene-
trans complex (Robich, 1989), whereas they seem to be absent in the new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some European authors, c.g. Bon & Chevassut (1989), have probably described
G. arenophilus previously under the name G. fulgens; the description given of C. fulgens
by these authors fits perfectly G. arenophilus: the spores are large, no pleurocystidia
have been observed, the habitat agrees and the taste is said to be slightly bitter. In the
same way, Gómez-Busutil et al. (1996) misidentified G. arenophilus with G. fulgens,
owing to the large spores which did not fit within the range of G. penetrans. According
to the recent monographical study of Bon & Roux (2002), C. fulgens is considered a
strictly hygrophilous species, bound to peat bogs (which is the original sense of Favre &
Maire, 1937); however, in the past, G. fulgens has also been considered an arenicolous or
carbonicolous taxon, found in dunes or burned soils (Orton in Watling & Gregory, 1993).
In fact, a comparison of spore ornamentation of Spanish collections of G. arenophilus
and G. fulgens, has revealed important differences, as G. fulgens shows spores with
rather coarse and prominent warts, partially connected forming crests (Fig. 1h), whereas
in G. arenophilus the warts are lower, not so coarse and hardly connected (Fig. 1c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Romagnesi (1976, 1979) described some new species collected in southern Europe;
among these, G. pseudofulgens was described as a carbonicolus taxon with long amyg-
daliform spores (9-11 x 5—5.5 µm), showing a hilar plage and a Galerina-like habit.
Gymnopilus spadiceus has large spores (8—10 x 4.5—6.5 µm), stout basidiomata (2.5—8
cm in pileus diameter), a squamose, dark brown-chestnut pileus, and capitula of cystidia
rather wide (5—8 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Moreno (1980) described G. fulgens var. luteicystis based on the yellow contents of
cystidia; this character is rather variable in many species of this genus and seems to lack
any taxonomical significance; in his description the spores are said to be amygdaliform,
7-8.5 x 4-5 µm, cystidia not capitate and the carpophores are fasciculate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Growing on sandy soils in North America, G. arenicola Hesler differs from G. areno-
philus in the smaller spores (7-8 x 3.5—4.5 µm), absence of veil, presence of pleuro-
cystidia and mild taste (Hesler, 1969). Another species with rather large spores, size
7.2-9.6(-10.4) x 5.6—7.2 µm, was described from Mexico by Guzman-Davalos (1995)
as G. subfulgens; it is also characterized by the strongly verrucose, widely ellip-
soid to subglobose spores, reddish orange-brown pileus, and lignicolous habitat, char-
acters that strongly differ from those of G. arenophilus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper deals with the generic delimitation of Leccinum and the taxonomic
and nomenclatural implications of the phylogenetic results presented in previ-
ous papers by Den Bakker et al. (2004a, 2004b). 28S nrDNA data, used in the
past to answer questions concerning genus delimitation of Leccinum, are re-
analysed. The phylogenetic inferences based on 28S nrDNA largely coincide
with Leccinum sensu Singer. The only species that is excluded from Leccinum is
L. eximium. At least one truffle-like genus, Chamonixia, should be included in Lec-
cinum. Morphological characters proposed in the past to delimit the genus are dis-
cussed in the light of the phylogenetic results. It is concluded that there is no single
diagnostic morphological character that unites species of the genus Leccinum and
that a better sampling, and other genes that provide a finer phylogenetic resolution,
are needed to reach a final answer about the genus delimitation of Leccinum and
other genera in the Boletaceae. The second part of this paper discusses characters
used in Leccinum-systematics in the past and contains a revision of the European
species of Leccinum with notes on related North American species. Sixteen species
are accepted for the European continent, of which one, Leccinum albostipitatum, is
described as new to science.#Abstract*]

[@In previous studies (Den Bakker et al., 2004a, 2004b, in press) we dealt with various
aspects of the evolutionary ecology of the genus Leccinum. The phylogenetic results
presented in these studies also have important taxonomic implications on various levels,
ranging from family to species level. In this chapter we will discuss these taxonomic
implications and present a taxonomic treatment of the European representatives of
the genus, with the exception of two mediterranean species, Leccinum corsicum! and
Leccinum lepidum?. Because many species occur also in North America (subsection
Leccinum — Den Bakker et al., 2004b) or have closely related sister species on that
continent (subsection Scabra — Den Bakker, submitted), we will also discuss, where
possible, North American species in additional notes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@GENERIC DELIMITATION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original genus Leccinum was introduced by Gray (1821) as a generic scientific
name for boletes and contained species of several currently recognized genera, such
as Gyroporus, Boletus, Suillus, Chalciporus and Xerocomus. Later the use of the name
Leccinum has been limited to the group of fungi we now know as Leccinum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although, especially in temperate and boreal regions, species of the genus Leccinum
are easily recognized by their prominent, squamulose stipe ornamentation, the delimita-
tion of the genus has been a matter of discussion for decades. Smith & Thiers (1971) con-
sidered the presence of a squamulose stipe ornamentation that darkens with age diagnos-
tic for the genus Leccinum. Singer (1986) considered the coarse squamulose stipe orna-
mentation the most important character of the genus Leccinum, irrespective of colour
or colour changes of the squamules. According to Singer (1986) the squamules of Lec-
cinum differ from those found in other boletes by the fact that the basidia, basidioles
and cystidia that make up these squamules are positioned on a distinct hyphal base,
while in other boletes they emerge directly from the hyphae in the cortex of the stipe.
In his discussion on the delimitation of the genus Boletus, Singer applied an additional
character to distinguish this genus from Leccinum. Boletes with a yellow hymenium,
à squamulose stipe and a trichodermal pileipellis are considered to belong to the genus
Boletus, while species that share the first two characters but have either a cutis-like or epi-
thelial pileipellis are considered to belong to Leccinum. Surprisingly, this last character
seems to be in contradiction with Singer's placement of Leccinum crocipodium (L. nigres-
cens in Singer, 1986) in Leccinum, because a strict application of his criteria would place
this species, which has a trichodermal pileipellis and yellow hymenium, in Boletus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sutara (1989), in an attempt to clarify the delimitation of the genus Leccinum, focused
entirely on the anatomy of the stipe cortex and the stipe ornamentation. According to
Sutara the stipe of Leccinum consists of longitudinally positioned hyphae. Beneath the
fertile layer composed of caulobasidia and caulocystidia, a thick (200—1000 µm) layer
is present (the stipital lateral stratum) over the entire stipe that is composed of almost
anticlinally positioned, non-interwoven, parallel hyphae. Usually the stipital lateral
stratum disrupts at maturity of the fruit-body, which results in the typical squamulose
stipe of Leccinum. The Boletus-type of the stipital lateral stratum is thin (20—80(—100)
µm), does not rupture in mature fruit-bodies, its hyphae are not conspicuously anticli-
nally positioned, its hyphae are often interwoven and in some cases the stipital lateral
stratum is gelatinized. Basically the anatomical features of the stipe lateral stratum
which Sutara described are a more detailed description of the anatomical features of
the stipe that were used by Singer (1986) to distinguish Leccinum from other genera in
the Boletaceae. Sutara proposed putting all boletes with a Leccinum-type stipital lateral
stratum in Leccinum. Consequently, not only taxa classically referred to Leccinum, but
also species like Boletus impolitus3, Boletus depilatus* and Boletus fragrans > belong
in Leccinum, if the criteria of Sutara are followed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently, molecular methods have been used to elucidate relationships within the
Boletaceae. Binder & Besl (2000) have used partial sequences of the nuclear ribosomal
large subunit (28S nrDNA) to explore phylogenetic relationships between species of
Leccinum and genera that have traditionally been seen as transient to or possibly part of
Leccinum. Later Bresinsky & Bes! (2003) split off the genus Leccinellum with Leccinum
nigrescens (Richon & Roze) Singer as type species, based on the results of the study of
Binder & Bes! (2000). According to Bresinsky & Bes! this genus is distinguished from
the other species of Leccinum by the presence of yellow pigments in the hymenium, a
blackish or greyish discoloration of the context of the fruit-bodies when bruised and a
pileus cuticle that consists of a palisade trichoderm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Molecular data#Misc-exposition*]

[@Introduction and methods#Misc-exposition*]

[@To assess the actual support from molecular data for the delimitation of Leccinellum
and the generic delimitations of Leccinum as proposed by Smith and Thiers (1971),
Singer (1986) and Sutara (1989), we downloaded a large sample of 28S sequences of
Boletales available on GenBank. We increased the sample size to 84 taxa, as opposed to
34 accessions in the original data set of Binder & Besl (2000). Not only did we increase
the sample size of some accessions of genera that have been considered closely related
to or even part of Leccinum (Tylopilus, Xerocomus, Boletus p.p.), but we also included
the gasteromycete genus Chamonixia, since the results of Bruns et al. (1998) suggested
this gasteromycete is closely related to species of Leccinum. We are aware of the fact
that sequences submitted to Genbank can be subject to misidentification (Bridge et
al., 2003; Vilgalys. 2003) and therefore results of a study based on these data have to
be used with caution before using these data for taxonomic changes. Although there
is a chance that part of the tree is based on wrongly identified accessions, for which
we will provide likely examples below, we emphasize that re-analyzing data that have
previously been used to propose taxonomic changes can provide valuable insights in
the phylogenetic robustness of these data. Recently, Binder & Hibbett (2004) published
a tree, based on 457 (28S nrDNA) sequences representing 333 species, of which 293
belong to the Boletales. As several sequences are not yet publicly available. we refrain
from including this analysis in this chapter. We note, however, that the conclusions with
regard to Leccinum as proposed here, do not seem to need any substantial modification
based on this larger data set.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The downloaded sequences were aligned using POA (Lee et al., 2002; http://www.
bioinformatics.ucla.edu/poa/POA_Online/Align.html), and adjusted by eye. Model-
test 3.4 (Posada & Crandall, 1998) and MrModeltest (Nylander, available from http:
Ílwww.ebc.uu.se/systzoo/staff/nylander.html) were used to determine the least rejected
model of sequence evolution. The likelihood ratio test as implemented in Modeltest and
MrModeltest (P » 0.05) was used to select the model that was subsequently used in the
Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses. PAUP*4.0b 10 (Swofford, 2002) was used to
perform the Maximum Parsimony (MP) and the Maximum Likelihood analyses, MrBayes
3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist, 2001) was used to perform the Bayesian analysis. The
analyses were performed as described in Den Bakker (2004b). MP bootstrap support values
were calculated based on 1000 bootstrap replicates, and 1000 trees were kept per replicate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results#Misc-exposition*]

[@The alignment of the sequences contained 947 sites, of which 332 were variable and
229 were parsimony-informative. The MP analysis resulted in 1902 MP trees of 1335
steps (C.I. — 0.367, R.I. — 0.687). Based on the outcome of Modeltest the Tamura-Nei
(Tamura & Nei, 1993) model with invariable sites and variable sites following a gamma
distribution was chosen. For this analysis the following settings were used: base fre-
quencies A: 0.2789, C: 0.2089, G: 0.2769, T: 0.2344; substitution rates A«»C: 1, A«»G:

-In L score 8021.60869. For the Bayesian analysis the general-time reversible model
(Rodriguez et al., 1990) was used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 1 shows a phylogram in which the results of the phylogenetic analyses are sum-
marized. With respect to the position of Leccinum the trees obtained from the different
analyses did not differ. Almost all species that were placed in Leccinum by Singer (1986)
are found in a well-supported clade, except for Boletus eximius®. Boletus eximius, a
species that has a strongly squamulose stipe ornamentation, differs from species of
Leccinum by the overall dark purplish colour of its fruit-body.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Remarkably, the branches that form the Leccinum clade are all long in comparison
to other Boletales in the phylogram, which could indicate that some of the accessions
are wrongly placed in Leccinum because of a phenomenon called long-branch attraction
(Felsenstein, 2004). Mainly phylogenies based on a MP optimalisation are susceptible
to this phenomenon (Felsenstein, 2004). However, the fact that more or less the same
topology is also recovered under ML and Bayesian optimalisation criteria pleas against
long-branch attraction.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the genus Leccinum is represented as a well-supported clade, 28S seems
to lack sufficient information to resolve the phylogeny of the Boletales. A putative
sistergroup to Leccinum can therefore not be assigned. According to this phylogram
Leccinum is a north-temperate genus with several species in Australasia (mainly in sect.
Roseoscabra) and Central America. Various species in Leccinum have been described
from tropical Africa (Heinemann, 1964), but the delimitation from tropical African
species of Tylopilus in still unclear (Th.W. Kuyper, pers. comm.). No molecular data
are available of these species and their position can therefore not be assessed. A phylo-
genetic analysis of tropical African species that have been described in Leccinum and
Tylopilus is urgently needed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discussion#Misc-exposition*]
[@Morphological distinction of Leccinum from other boletes seems to be difficult,
even if we omit the recently derived sequestrate genera Chamonixia and Octavianina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@516 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@In Europe species of the genus Leccinum can be recognized by the combination of the
following characters: a squamulose stipe ornamentation, pores that are either brownish,
whitish or yellowish (not reddish as in Boletus erythropus’), and, if the hymenium
contains yellowish pigments, the context of the stipe usually discolours greyish or
blackish when bruised.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to the phylogram depicted in Fig. 1, L. chromapes'® is sister to the
remainder of Leccinum plus Chamonixia. Its taxonomic position is still doubtful. Halling
& Mueller (2003) considered it a member of Ty/opilus, at the same time treating another
species closely resembling it as Leccinum cartagoense 9. Curiously, in the cladogram
produced by Binder & Hibbett (2004) Tylopilus chromapes (AF139709) belongs to
the Leccinum clade, while accession AY 612834 is placed in a clade with various other
Tylopilus species. Evidently, the taxonomic identity of both accessions needs to be
determined before the position of L. chromapes can be elucidated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sequestrate (truffle-like) Chamonixia caespitosa" is nested within Leccinum. In
the MP analysis it is found in a strongly supported clade with amongst others L. corsicum,
L. crocipodium and L. pseudoscabrum. The ML and Bayesian analyses do not support
this placement and place Chamonixia basal to the clade containing sections Leccinum and
Luteoscabra. Analyses of mtDNA (Bruns et al., 1998) and chemotaxonomic evidence
(the presence of the cyclopentenones gyrocyanin and gyroporin) is consistent with such
a placement (Gill & Steglich, 1987). Remarkably this is not the only sequestrate genus
that is derived from a Leccinum-like ancestor. Binder (1999) and Binder & Hibbet (2004)
showed (based on the phylogenetic analysis of 28S-sequences) that Octavianina is also
nested within Leccinum. These sequences are at present not yet available on Genbank,
making it impossible to reassess their phylogenetic position. The phylogenetic position
of these sequestrate genera implies that the evolutionary step from a normal fruit-body
to a truffle-like fruit-body is a relatively small one. Evidence for such rapid evolutionary
transitions from boletoid and agaricoid ancestors to sequestrate taxa is not uncommon
(Bruns et al., 1989; Peintner et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2001; Binder & Bresinsky,
2002). Interestingly, both Chamonixia and Octavianina have ornamented spores, while
Leccinum has without exception smooth spores. A taxonomical consequence of the
phylogenetic placement of Chamonixia (and maybe Octavianina) in the Leccinum clade
could be to sink these sequestrate taxa in Leccinum. Other options would be to remove
L. chromapes from Leccinum or to subdivide the genus Leccinum into smaller genera.
However, lack of sufficient resolution of the cladogram and different results from the
MP. ML and Bayesian analyses make it hardly recommendable to propose taxonomic
changes for the time being.#Misc-exposition*]

sect. Luteoscabra and sect. Leccinum. The MP analysis showed high bootstrap support#Misc-exposition*]

[@(77%) for the clade that largely coincides (if we do not consider the sequestrate genera)
with section Luteoscabra Singer (1947). The posterior probability of this clade is less
than 90 %, which may indicate that the strong MP bootstrap support might be caused
by long-branch attraction and may falsely suggest a monophyletic (natural) group. The
only difference with the original section Luteoscabra is that, as already indicated by
Lannoy & Estades (1995), species like L. pseudoscabrum and L. albellum!! also belong
to this clade. Bresinsky & Besl's genus Leccinellum overlaps with the Luteoscabra
clade found in this analysis, consisting of L. pseudoscabrum, L. albellum and L. cro-
cipodium and related species, but for unclear reasons they exclude L. subglabripes '2,
L. rubropunctum © and ‘Boletus’ longicurvipes ‘4 from Leccinellum, thereby leaving
the genus Leccinellum paraphyletic. Also from a morphological point of view we do
not think there are grounds for assuming that Leccinellum as defined by Bresinsky &
Besl forms a monophyletic group that can be discriminated from other boletes by one
or more diagnostic characters. Moreover, the 28S data seem to be insufficient or even
contradictory for the recognition of Leccinellum as a distinct genus. Taking monophyly
of a genus as an essential criterion for generic recognition, our delimitation of the genus
will be more or less congruent with that of Singer (1986).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The group of North American species (A. /ongicurvipes, B. rubropunctus, B. sub-
glabripes and B. hortonii !5 in the analysis) that has previously been classified as Boletus
section Pseudoleccinum by Smith & Thiers (1971) seems to pose a problem. Species
of this section have a squamulose stipe ornamentation, a yellowish hymenium, but do
not show the blackish/greyish discoloration of the context that is found in European
species of Leccinum with a yellowish hymenium. The 28S analysis indicates that
B. longicurvipes, B. rubropunctus, and B. subglabripes are well nested within Leccinum
and should therefore be considered species of Leccinum. Boletus hortonii on the other
hand, even though morphologically very close, is found in a clade together with spe-
cies of Xerocomus, B. impolitus and B. depilatus. While molecular data put most of the
species of section Pseudoleccinum in Leccinum, chemotaxonomic data (the presence
of the pulvinic acid derivatives xerocomic acid and variegatic acid) suggest a relation-
ship with Boletus and not with Leccinum (Gill & Steglich, 1987). To what extent these
molecular and chemotaxonomic results are influenced by misidentifications and other
errors in sequence databases remains to be investigated.#Misc-exposition*]

claim that some species can also be associated with Salix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SPECIFIC DELIMITATION#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Flora agaricina neerlandica a strictly morphological species concept is used
(Kuyper, 1988). In this sense Van Steenis’ (1957) statement is followed: a ‘good’ species
differs in at least two, independent morphological characters. However, from Kuyper's
essay it can be deduced that we are not dealing with a typological view, but that actually
the use of the morphological species concept should be seen as a hypothesis of what
the boundaries of ‘natural’ species (biological (Mayr, 1957) or evolutionary species
(Simpson, 1951; Wiley, 1978) are. Here we use the term ‘natural’ species for species
as individuals in a philosophical sense, i.e. we assume that species exist in nature,
independent of our ability to recognize them, and that species are able to evolve and
speciate. This is in contrast to a strict typological species concept where species are
more or less considered natural kinds, constructions of the human mind, without any
necessary real existence, and evolution of the taxon is only possible when this results
in a new class (species). Because we are not only interested in recognizing species, but
also in their ecology and their evolutionary history, we consider species individuals. As
such we see a taxonomy based on morphology as a hypothesis of what the boundaries#Misc-exposition*]

[@Combining biological (breeding experiments), evolutionary (molecular phylogenies)
and phenetic (morphology) data in one species concept is by no means easy. Aanen &
Kuyper (2004) described their approach in arriving at an operational species concept in
the Hebeloma crustuliniforme complex. Their approach involved the use of a phenetic#Misc-exposition*]
[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European species of Leccinum 521#Page-header*]

[@concept that is at least consistent with biological criteria (intercompatible collections
should not be classified as different species) and evolutionary criteria (species that turn
out to be polyphyletic should be rejected). In the case of Leccinum, a similar approach
to arrive at consistency between phenetic and evolutionary data was used. It is important
to reassess the status of morphospecies if molecular data show that the morphospecies
is clearly polyphyletic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basically two classes of explanations for polyphyletic morphospecies can be distin-
guished. The first class of explanations are biological causes for polyphyly, like hybridi-
sation. The second class of explanations is that we are actually dealing with artificial
species (natural kinds) and that the morphological character states that are considered
diagnostic for such a taxon fall within the phenotypic variability of more than one spe-
cies. Careful reassessment of other morphological characters usually shows that other
characters are indicative for the monophyletic groups that can be considered species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Regarding the names of these groups, type specimens were used as reference points
and if more than one type specimen was present in a monophyletic species, the classical
nomenclatural rules with respect to priority and synonymy of names were applied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Practical application#Misc-exposition*]

[@The practical application of the operational species concept as practised here will
be illustrated with the examples of L. scabrum, L. holopus and L. pulchrum and two
gene trees (Figs. 2, 3). In these trees the individual accessions are named on the basis
of traditional morphological criteria (Lannoy & Estades, 1995) to the left, and to the
right the accepted names are given as a result of the current species concept.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum scabrum#Misc-exposition*]

[@Traditionally, L. scabrum is considered a Betula-associate with a blackish stipe orna-
mentation and a brownish pileus. The most important diagnostic criterion, however, is
the fact that the context does not change colour when bruised or becomes at most a little
pinkish. The gene trees (Figs. 2, 3) show that accessions named L. scabrum are found
in three well-supported clades in the Gapdh tree (the L. snellii !6 clade, the L. schis-
tophilum and the L. scabrum/L. melaneum clade) and in one well-supported clade
(L. snellii clade) and one weakly supported clade (L. scabrum/L. rotundifoliae) in the
ITS2 tree.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As indicated above, the polyphyly of L. scabrum can mean two things, either L. sca-
brum is an artificial species or L. scabrum is a ‘real’ taxonomic entity and the characters
that are generally considered diagnostic for the species need to be reconsidered. Of
course there is a trivial third alternative explanation, viz. that the whole clade constitutes
just one very variable species. However, patterns of morphological differences, cor-
related with molecular divergence, militate against that solution. In the case of L. sca-
brum the second option was chosen. The accessions that were named L. scabrum but
were placed in the L. snellii and L. schistophilum clade were not microscopically differ-
ent from accessions of these species that showed a typical (bluish and pinkish) discolora-
tion of the context. Therefore it can be concluded that characters based on discoloration
of the context cannot be used to discriminate L. scabrum from some (atypical) forms#Misc-exposition*]

[@of other species. Morphological comparison of accessions of the L. snellii, L. schis-
tophilum and the L. scabrum/L. melaneum clade in the Gapdh tree showed that mainly
microscopical characters (pileipellis structure, spore shape and caulocystidia) can be
used to distinguish accessions of these clades from each other (see key).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum holopus#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both the Gapdh (Fig. 2) and the ITS2 gene tree (Fig. 3) show a monophyletic clade
for L. holopus and both trees suggest that the eastern North American accessions form
a monophyletic group on their own. Morphologically, however, there is no character
that can be used to tell accessions of the North American clade apart from European
collections, and therefore, because basically a morphological species concept is used,
this clade cannot be considered a species on its own.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum pulchrum#Misc-exposition*]

[@Specimens identified as L. pulchrum are found in three monophyletic clades in the
Gapdh tree: one accession is in the L. scabrum clade, the accessions of the type material
are found in the L. rotundifoliae clade and one accession designated as L. pulchrum is
found in the £L. /tolopus clade. For this reason we see L. pulchrum as circumscribed by
Lannoy & Estades (1995) as an artificial taxon. The morphological characters (mainly
the pileus colour and the discoloration of the context when bruised) on which the
identification of L. pulchrum is based are apparently not diagnostic for a molecular
monophyletic taxon. Based on the sequence data L. pulchrum has to be synonymized
with L. rotundifoliae, a boreal, subalpine and arctic taxon that has been confused with
L. holopus in the past (hence the presence of some L. rotundifoliae accessions in the
L. holopus clade in the Gapdh and ITS2 gene trees). These results show that the morpho-
logical variability of L. rotundifoliae is wider than previously understood, Re-examina-
tion of the L. pulchrum accessions, on the basis of a set of different characters, in the
L. holopus and the L. scabrum clade showed that these fit the morphological concept
of these species, and must be considered as misidentifications.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INFRASPECIFIC DELIMITATION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species that are delimited according to the species concept that is previously
discussed show a continuous variability of morphological characters like pileus colour
and discoloration of the context. In L. holopus we observe a different pattern. In this
taxon fruit-bodies that are found in Sphagnum bogs or other wet acidic environments
have the typical slender habitus of L. holopus, have pale whitish stipe squamules and
do not show any noticeable discoloration, except for some tiny bluish spots in the stipe
base or the basal mycelium. Fruit-bodies of the same species found in drier habitats,
like marshy forest, usually have a less slender habitus (comparable to L. scabrum),
brownish to blackish stipe squamules and pinkish to reddish discoloration of the stipe
context and a green bluish discoloration in the stipe base. In Europe the latter form has
been described as L. nucatum Lannoy & Estades. Microscopically the two forms are
not distinct, neither are they in the Gapdh and ITS2 trees. Moreover in Europe inter-
mediates between L. holopus and L. nucatum can be found, and therefore we do not
consider L. nucatum of any taxonomic value. The situation in North America seems to
be different. Here we find apart from the normal slender, whitish form of L. holopus,#Misc-exposition*]
[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European species of Leccinum 523#Page-header*]

[@L. holopus var. americanum "7 Smith & Thiers (see discussion under L. holopus for diag-
nostic characters of L. holopus var. americanum). Both gene trees indicate that there is a
geographical distinction between accessions of L. holopus from eastern North America
and from Europe and the arctic regions. However, there is no relation with the varieties
recognized. In North America, the varieties seem to be rather constant throughout the
distribution area. We therefore think it is legitimate to recognize them taxonomically.#Misc-exposition*]

[@HYBRIDISATION AND INTROGRESSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two taxa seem to pose a serious problem when we apply the criterion of monophyly
in at least one gene tree without this monophyly being significantly contradicted by
other gene trees. The first problematic taxon is L. cyaneobasileucum (as L. brunneo-
griseolum in Den Bakker, 2005). This taxon is morphologically distinct from L. holopus
in most of its microscopical and macroscopical characters. The Gapdh tree shows that
accessions of this species form a highly supported monophyletic clade and indicates
that this species diverged from L. holopus long before a divergence of European and
North American L. holopus took place. Moreover, the divergence between L. holopus
and L. cyaneobasileucum (1.7 to 2.3 96 divergence) is comparable to the divergence
between L. scabrum and L. rotundifoliae (1.5 to 2.3 % divergence), which indicates
Shots f npo "amb 5. cyanedpasiencin tiverged wong ume ago, given the tact that
Gapah evolves Cock-like im Leccinwm subsect. Scabra (Den Bakker, 2005). Ine ITS2
tree, however, shows that L. cyaneobasileucum is placed in the European/arctic clade
of L. holopus. Other studies (Binder, 1999; Den Bakker et al., 2004a) show that the
sequence of ITS1 of this species is also identical to that of European accessions of
L. holopus. Considering the morphological distinctness of L. cyaneobasileucum and the
fact that Gapdh seems to indicate that this taxon diverged from L. holopus a long time
ago, we consider this taxon a species with minimal phylogenetic quality. Probably recent
hybridization between L. cyaneobasileucum and L. holopus and subsequent introgres-
sion has resulted in the introduction of an L. holopus-ITS in the L. cyaneobasileucum
genome.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second problem is L. melaneum. Collections of this species differ mainly from
L. scabrum in the greyish colour of the stipe. In other macroscopical and microscopi-
cal characters it is identical to L. scabrum. The ITS2 tree shows that L. melaneum
accessions form a well-supported clade of their own. Visual comparison of the ITS2
sequences with other sequences of species of subsection Scabra showed that, besides
several autapomorphic character states, a deletion that is present in L. scabrum and
L. rotundifoliae, but absent in other species of subsection Scabra is also absent in
L. melaneum. Given the fact that L. melaneum shows several molecular autapomorphic
characters, we think that L. melaneum represents an ancient hybrid between L. scabrum
and a L. holopus-like ancestor. The molecular data indicate that this taxon is evolving
independently from L. scabrum. Strictly, if we were to apply the two character rule to
L. melaneum, we would have to consider it a variety of L. scabrum. However, given its
putative hybridogenic origin we prefer to give it specific status, until further molecular
research has resolved its taxonomic status.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopical and ecological characters#Misc-exposition*]

[@The discussion of the macroscopical and ecological characters is mainly based on
personal observations of the authors; the descriptions of the individual species are based
on our own observations, sometimes supplemented with descriptions from literature or
fieldnotes and descriptions of other mycologists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopical characters#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileipellis was studied in radial section of the pileipellis and mounted in water.
All observations that are discussed are made in this way unless indicated otherwise.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores were mounted in demineralised water and observed under oil-immersion.
Only spores from the (pileal) hymenium were used and an attempt was made to measure
only mature spores. Spores were considered mature when a clearly developed, slightly
(brownish) coloured spore wall was present and guttules could be observed within the
spore. Sometimes extremely elongate spores (Q > 4) were present in the hymenium of
older fruit-bodies. These are considered anomalies, probably associated with unnatural
aging of the fruit-bodies. These were not included in the measurements. Circa 30 spores
per collection were measured. Hymenocystidia were observed in a solution of 5% KOH.
To observe caulocystidia a stipital squamule was picked from halfway the stipe with a
pair of fine tweezers, mounted in a 5% KOH solution and squashed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MACROSCOPICAL CHARACTERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Discoloration of context#Misc-exposition*]

[@In many species the context of the pileus and stipe changes colour when exposed to
the air. Traditionally the discoloration of the context has been considered an important
character in the classification of Leccinum. The most important discolorations of the
usually white context are a blackish, a bluish and/or a pinkish to reddish discoloration.
Especially the pinkish-reddish and blackish discolorations of the context are often eas-
ily observed when a fruit-body is cut in half and the exposed surface is bruised with a
blunt object, for instance the blunt side of a knife. Usually the discoloration starts within
seconds after the context is bruised, however, the bluish discoloration can sometimes
appear after several hours and is sometimes only visible in parts of the fruit-body that
have already been damaged by snails or arthropods.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The absence of a blackish discoloration has been used by Lannoy & Estades (1995)
as a diagnostic character of subsection Scabra. Although our ITS results showed that
subsection Scabra, if defined by this character, is probably polyphyletic, Gapdh-data
show considerable support for the monophyly of subsection Scabra as defined by Lan-
noy & Estades (1995). At the species level the intensity of the blackish discoloration
seems to help with species identification within subsection Leccinum. The context
of L. vulpinum darkens generally less intensively than that of related species such as
L. insigne'8, L. aurantiacum and L. versipelle.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European species of Leccinum#Misc-exposition*]

[@A pinkish, sometimes reddish, discoloration of the context is considered to be a
diagnostic character for species within subsections Scabra and Leccinum. Smith &
Thiers (1971) made a distinction in their keys between species in subsection Leccinum
that show a pinkish discoloration before turning blackish (like L. aurantiacum sensu
Smith & Thiers) and those that do not show a pinkish discoloration, but only a blackish
discoloration (like L. insigne). We found that this pinkish discoloration was often lacking
in species that were supposed to have it according to literature and found that usually the
European species can be recognized by other, more stable characters. Watling (1970)
and Lannoy & Estades (1995) considered the intensity of the pinkish discoloration a
distinctive character to distinguish L. scabrum and related species. Leccinum scabrum
is supposed to display no or only a slightly pinkish discoloration, while species like
L. roseofractum are supposed to show a rapid reddish discoloration. We found samples
identified as L. scabrum and L. roseofractum in one clade and could not find any phy-
logenetic signal that these were two distinct species. Moreover, we found that the inten-
sity of the pinkish discoloration of the context of the accessions in this clade is a
gradual one and can therefore not be used as a diagnostic character of any of these spe-
cies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A bluish discoloration is present in most species of subsections Leccinum, Fumosa
and Scabra, except in L. scabrum and L. rotundifoliae. This blue discoloration is usually
found in the cortex of the stipe base and/or in the basal mycelium, though in some species
like L. variicolor, it is found in the cortex of the lower half of the stipe. The colour is
usually blue (K. & W. 23A7) or greenish blue (24A5, 25A5). In L. variicolor the greenish
blue discoloration usually changes to yellow in dried fruit-bodies, a phenomenon rarely
observed in other species of subsection Scabra. The absence of the bluish discoloration
is diagnostic for L. scabrum and L. rotundifoliae. However, the bluish discoloration is
not always clearly observable and should therefore be used with caution.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other colour changes of the context, such as yellow and red discolorations in the
stipe base and an olivaceous discoloration in the apex of the stipe are variable within
species. In particular the olivaccous discoloration in the apex of the stipe seems to be
associated either with a wet growing habitat or continuous wet weather. For this reason
they are considered of very limited diagnostic value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macrochemical reactions#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lannoy & Estades (1995) considered the reaction of the context with FeSO, and
Formol to be of importance for the identification of certain species groups. When FeSO;
crystals are rubbed against the context of (preferably) the apex of the stipe, a green-
ish grey to blackish discoloration may appear. Formol, when applied to the context,
sometimes induces a pinkish to reddish discoloration of the context. The usefulness of
FeSO, as a reagent for the identification of species in subsection Scabra has been tested.
It was often found to be very gradual, and difficult to assess whether the discoloration
was greyish green or greyish. Moreover, there seems to be a relation between age and
humidity of the fruit-body and the intensity of the reaction with either formaldehyde
or FeSO,. Therefore these macrochemical reactions have not been used in the present
work.#Misc-exposition*]
[@526 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 4, 2005#Page-header*]

[@Colour of pileus and overall colour of fruit-body#Misc-exposition*]

[@The colour of the pileus has always been an important diagnostic character in Lec-
cinum taxonomy. In particular new species have been based on an overall pale appear-
ance or very pale pileus colour. Often authors considered these species as pale-coloured
sister species to darker coloured species. Lannoy & Estades (1995) suggested that
L. cyaneobasileucum is a pale form of L. brunneogriseolum, by indicating that it resem-
bles the latter species except for the overall colour of the fruit-bodies. The molecular
data (Den Bakker et al., 2004b, 2005) suggest that most species display a whole colour
range from light to dark. Based on these findings it can be concluded that for instance
L. cyaneobasileucum is a pale variant of L. brunneogriseolum, and that L. avellaneum
and L. roseofractum represent the lightest and darkest limits respectively of L. scabrum.
Also L. roseotinctum and L. percandidum are just pale-coloured forms of L. versipelle. In
addition, molecular data show that the generally white or light-coloured species L. holo-
pus may form fruit-bodies with a brown pileus and dark squamules on the stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within subsection Leccinum, however, there is a clear distinction between species
with a dark reddish pileus colour that changes to dark reddish brown in exsiccates (like
L. aurantiacum and L. vulpinum) and species with a orange-brown pileus colour that
changes to light brown in exsiccates (like L. versipelle and L. albostipitatum).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Stipe squamules and stipe surface colour#Misc-exposition*]

[@While the colour of the pileus is variable in most species, the colour of the stipe
surface can be useful in the identification of Leccinum species. Care should be taken
with overall pale-coloured fruit-bodies and fruit-bodies that are found in high and
dense vegetation. In the first case fruit-bodies might be from a mycelium that produces
a limited amount of dark pigments, in the second case shade can prevent the formation
of dark pigments (personal observation of the first author).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In subsection Leccinum a distinction can be made between species with a basically
greyish to blackish stipe ornamentation (L. vulpinum and L. versipelle) and species with
a whitish to reddish brown stipe ornamentation (L. aurantiacum and L. albostipitatum).
In subsection Scabra most species have a greyish to blackish stipe ornamentation, with
the exception of L. holopus var. holopus, which has an initially white stipe ornamenta-
tion that becomes darker in mature fruit-bodies, and L. cyaneobasileucum, which has an
initially whitish stipe ornamentation that becomes dirty greyish in older fruit-bodies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The shape and pattern of the stipe squamules is of diagnostic value as well, especially
in subsection Scabra. The stipe squamules are usually fine at the apex and coarser at the
base of the stipe. Leccinum scabrum and L. holopus usually have overall fine squamules
on the stipe, whereas L. cyaneobasileucum usually has a stipe covered with coarse,
flocculose squamules. While in most species the squamules are more or less conical,
some species (like L. rotundifoliae) have more warty squamules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The colour of the stipe surface beneath the squamules is white or whitish in most
European Leccinum species with the exception of L. crocipodium with yellow back-
ground colour, and L. melaneum in which the surface is distinctly greyish.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pileus surface#Misc-exposition*]
[@The pileus surface in species of subsections Leccinum, Fumosa and Scabra is felted
to fibrillose. In subsection Leccinum the fibrils on the pileus surface may develop into#Misc-exposition*]
[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European species of Leccinum 527#Page-header*]

[@a pattern of appressed squamules. The surface may become viscid or slightly slimy
in mature and wet fruit-bodies. The surface of L. pseudoscabrum is often distinctly
rugulose, especially when young, whereas that of L. crocipodium is tomentose. Both
in L. pseudoscabrum and L. crocipodium the surface of the pileus usually cracks with
age, especially during dry periods. Other species only show a cracked surface under
extremely dry circumstances.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pileus margin#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of Leccinum have an entire margin that, especially in younger fruit-
bodies, projects a few millimeters beyond the tubes. In subsection Leccinum the margin
of the pileus is inflexed in young fruit-bodies, becoming disrupted and appendiculate
when the fruit-body ages.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Host specificity#Misc-exposition*]

[@Host specificity is often considered an important character for taxonomy (see Den
Bakker et al., 2004b for further references). Species of subsection Scabra are associ-
ated with Betula, while species of subsection Fumosa are associated with Populus.
Leccinum montanum® and L. californicum ?° are two species of the Sierra Nevada
(California, USA) associated with Populus (Thiers, 1975). Based on the absence of a
blackish discoloration of the context and their entire pileus margin Thiers referred them
to subsection Scabra. The habitus of these species and their association with Populus
suggests that they are actually more closely related to species of subsection Fumosa.
In subsection Leccinum species are found that are exclusively associated with Populus
(L. albostipitatum), with Betula (L. versipelle and L. atrostipitatum?'), with Pinaceae
(L. vulpinum, L. piceinum) and with Ericaceae that form arbutoid mycorrhizas (L. man-
zanitae ?? and L. monticola ??). In Europe the only species that is not host specific is L.
aurantiacum. This species is associated with Quercus and other Fagaceae, Populus and
Salix, Betula and sometimes with Tilia. Although many species within Leccinum are
host specific, the use of host associations in the field as a diagnostic character is often
difficult, since usually more than one host is present in the vicinity of a fruit-body.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Edaphic factors#Misc-exposition*]

[@Especially in subsection Scabra the acidity and the humidity of the soil appear to be im-
portant factors determining the distribution of the different species. While most species of
subsection Scabra are found in acidic habitats, L. schistophilum is found in basic habitats.
Leccinium holopus var. holopus is found in waterlogged Sphagnum vegetation, L. holo-
pus var. americanum is found in less wet, marshy Betula forests. Also in wet but not
waterlogged habitats species like L. schistophilum, L. cyaneobasileucum, and L. varii-
color can be found, whereas L. scabrum seems to be a species of drier habitats.#Misc-exposition*]

L. variicolor, as depicted here, is mainly composed of so-called *cylindrocysts'.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MICROSCOPICAL CHARACTERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anatomy of pileipellis#Misc-exposition*]

[@The anatomy of the pileipellis has received much attention in the taxonomy of
Leccinum (Blum, 1970; Smith & Thiers, 1971; Lannoy & Estades, 1995). Within the
genus Leccinum, two basic types can be recognized, viz. (1) a trichoderm of erect
chains of elements, sometimes forming a palisade, typical for L. pseudoscabrum and
L. crocipodium (see Fig. 4A) and (2) a complex type of intricate trichoderm, often with
a cutis-like suprapellis, typical for subsections Leccinum, Fumosa and Scabra (Figs. 4
C, D and E). Although this cannot be considered a real cutis, and in young fruit-bod-
ies of species of subsection Scabra sometimes a real trichoderm without a cutis-like
suprapellis can be observed, we will for convenience call this type of pileipellis a cutis
in the species descriptions. Particular in subsection Scabra pileipellis structures appear
to be rather variable. Lannoy & Estades (1995) considered the presence or absence of
so-called cylindrocysts in the pileipellis an important character for certain species in
subsection Scabra. They defined cylindrocysts as hyphal elements that are maximal 80
µm long and minimal 10 zum wide and have length/width ratio of less than 4. According
to Lannoy & Estades the presence of cylindrocysts is diagnostic for their subsection
Pseudoscabra.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study revealed that the occurrence of cylindrocysts is not consistently
correlated with the current species concept. Furthermore, no indication was found that#Misc-exposition*]
[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European species of Leccinum 529#Page-header*]

[@subsection Pseudoscabra forms a natural group. Species with and without cylindrocysts
have been synonymised (L. rigidipes and L. scabrum, L. aerugineum and L. holopus).
However, in some species, like L. variicolor and L. cyaneobasileucum cylindrocysts
are usually abundant, and may facilitate identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pigmentation of pileipellis#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pigmentation of the pileipellis elements can be granularly incrusted, plaque-like
incrusted or vacuolar. The pigmentation type varies within species. Certain pigmenta-
tion types occur more frequently in certain species. For instance the pileipellis elements
of L. schistophilum and L. aurantiacum are often plaque-like incrusted. The colour of
the pigments observed usually corresponds to the overall colour of the pileus. Smith et
al. (1967) and Watling (1970) introduced another character for discriminating species
in subsection Leccinum, viz. the capacity of the pigments to form globules when the
pileipellis is mounted in Melzer’s reagent. This reaction did not appear to be constant
within species, and could not be used as diagnostic character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spore size and spore shape#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spore shape appeared to be a better diagnostic character than spore size in discrimi-
nating species. In subsection Leccinum the mean Q-value (length : width ratio) varies
between 3.1 and 3.5, and in subsection Scabra between 2.7 and 2.8, with the exception
of the European collections of L. scabrum and L. cyaneobasileucum in which a mean
Q-value of 3.0 and 3.2 was observed. In the collections of L. scabrum from eastern
North America the mean Q-value was 2.8. Since the mean Q-value was observed to
be constant in the species of subsection Scabra in Europe, this could be used as an ad-
ditional character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hymenocystidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hymenocystidia in the tubular hymenium (pleurocystidia) are usually lageniform.
The hymenocystidia found on the pore surface (cheilocystidia) have various shapes,
being either clavate, utriform or lageniform. In subsection Leccinum the cheilocystidia
usually have a brownish content. Size and shape of hymenical cystidia were found to
be of no diagnostic value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caulocystidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thus far, caulocystidia have remained relatively unstudied in Leccinum systematics.
Smith & Thiers (1971) considered caulocystidia too variable to be of major taxonomic
importance, with the exception of a certain type of caulocystidia in L. snellii, Smith
& Thiers considered the presence of lageniform cystidia with a septum (secondary
crosswall) on the transition between the swollen part of the cystidium and the neck
diagnostic for this species. Examination of other species of subsection Scabra showed
that in most species of this subsection this septate-lageniform type of caulocystidia can
be found, but always in small numbers. In L. snellii and in L. variicolor, these septate-
lageniform cystidia are usually common and easy to observe. This is a pattern that is
seen repeatedly, as in most species in subsections Leccinum and Scabra various types of
caulocystidia can be found, but in some species certain types seem to be more numerous
than other types. As such caulocystidia can therefore be used as an additional character
in the identification of individual species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notwithstanding intensive molecular and morphological studies of collections (in-
cluding holotypes) that were associated with Populus, Quercus and Betula, no clear
support could be found for the recognition of L. populinum and L. quercinum as distinct
species. Therefore we merge these taxa into one species, L. aurantiacum, with a broad
host range (Den Bakker et al., 2004b). No obvious differences in spore size or in spore
dimensions were found between collections that were associated with either Populus or
Quercus (Fig. 6), in contrast to the observations by Korhonen (1995). Kibby (2002) in-
dicated that the shape of the caulocystidia of L. populinum differs from those of L. quer-
cinum. Leccinum populinum is supposed to have inflated, clavate caulocystidia, while the
caulocystidia are usually fusiform capitate in L. quercinum. The present study revealed#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum salicola Watling was described by Watling (1971) and, according to the
author, could be "... distinguished from all other members of the L. aurantiacum com-
plex by the cinnamon to brick-coloured pileus, coupled with the habitat and (small and
stocky) stature and the (pallid or sepia) pore colour when young...". The small stocky
stature of this taxon is probably a result of the exposed nature of its habitat (Salix re-
pens vegetation on cliff-tops), and both pileus and pore colour do not differ from our
concept ot L. aurantiacum. N study of the type material showed that Leccinum salicola
fits well into our concept of L. aurantiacum. Leccinum salicola is therefore considered
a synonym of L. aurantiacum.#Misc-exposition*]

we followed the recommendations of Redeuilh (1990) and called L. aurantiacum sensu
Korhonen L. leucopodium (Pers.) Dórfelt & G. Berg. Careful examination of the study
of Dórfelt & Berg (1990), however, showed that their interpretation of L. leucopodium
is the same as our concept of L. aurantiacum. They had introduced the name L. leuco-
podium for the taxon growing under Populus, as the name L. aurantiacum was applied
for the taxon associated with Quercus. Therefore L. aurantiacum sensu Korhonen is
described as a new species (L. albostipitatum), in order to avoid taxonomic confusion
about this taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum aurantiacum has for a long time been broadly interpreted and until re-
cently at least two European species that are associated with Populus were included in
the interpretation of this name. The importance of the colour of the stipital squamules
has not been sufficiently appreciated. Korhonen (1995) was the first author to separate
these species. However, his proposal to use the name L. aurantiacum for the taxon with
pale squamules can not be accepted for various reasons. Consequently, the recently de-
scribed species L. populinum has to be reduced to a synonym of L. aurantiacum, while
L. aurantiacum sensu Korhonen is described here as new, viz. L. albostipitatum. The
main difference between L. aurantiacum and L. albostipitatum is found in the colour
of the stipital ornamentation and the pileus colour both in fresh and dried fruit-bodies.
The first species has generally a brownish-reddish stipital ornamentation that is already
reddish in young fruit-bodies, whereas L. albostipitatum starts with completely white
stipital ornamentation that darkens slightly in older fruit-bodies. Care should be taken
in using this character when the fruit-bodies are found in high vegetation. We have ob-
served that the stipital ornamentation of L. aurantiacum can be almost white when the
stipe is covered with grass. In these cases the pileus colour provides a better character
to separate the two species. Leccinum aurantiacum has a vividly red to reddish brown
pileus, and when dried the pileus is reddish brown. The pileus colour of L. albostipitatum
is generally vividly orange and changes to a dull light brown in dried fruit-bodies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum aurantiacum and L. albostipitatum are the only two European representa-
tives ofa group (clade) of closely related species with a (sub-)boreal distribution, While
the species boundaries of the two species encountered in Europe are clearcut both mor-
phologically and molecularly (Den Bakker et al., 2004b), the situation in North America
is still taxonomically confusing and in need of a revision, which needs to be supported
with additional molecular data. Leccinum aurantiacum is probably a European species,
and no records are known from North America. The descriptions of L. aurantiacum
in North American literature represent a mixture between a L. vulpinum-like, conifer
associated taxon and North American species that are associated with broad-leaved
trees, such as L. insigne, and L. brunneum?4. One L. aurantiacum-like collection from
Ontario, studied by Den Bakker et al. (2004b), belonged to the clade of L. albostipitatum.
However, with the current literature (Smith & Thiers, 1971) it was impossible to assign
a name to that collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum vulpinum can readily be recognized in the field on account of its dark red-
dish brown pileus and distinct black squamules on the stipe. The intensity of the blackish
discoloration of the context is only a fraction of the intensity of the discoloration as seen
in L. versipelle and L. aurantiacum, which, together with its association with conifers,
can help to facilitate identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@from central Europe. Most collections from Sweden that were collected in Picea for-
est and therefore identified as L. piceinum did not differ in their pileus colour or other
morphological characters from L. vulpinum. The collections from central Europe dif-
fered from L. vulpinum mainly by a duller pileus colour, a character that is also used by
Lannoy & Estades (1995) to distinguish L. piceinum from L. vulpinum. The holotype of
L. piceinum was not sufficiently well preserved to make a morphological study possible,
however, material from the /ocus typicus did not differ from our concept of L. vulpinum,
except for the pileus colour. In an Austrian collection of L. piceinum we amplified an
ITS sequence type that differed from the type found in a Norwegian L. vulpinum (see
Den Bakker et al., 2004b). Whether the central European collections associated with
Picea with an aberrant pileus colour represent a truly genetically distinct taxon remains
to be investigated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum vulpinum is probably common in North America. A Gapdh sequence of a
collection from Manitoulin Island (Ontario, Canada, H C den Bakker 415 (L), Genbank
accession AY538793) was nearly identical to the Gapdh sequence of L. vulpinum from
Norway. Apparently this species is in North America commonly confused with L. au-
rantiacum, and the descriptions of Smith & Thiers (1971) of L. aurantiacum and plates
of L. aurantiacum, L. fibrillosum?6 and L. subtestaceum ?? in Bessette et al. (2000) seem
to actually represent L. vulpinum or a closely related species. For a further discussion

[@The number of species around L. versipelle has steadily grown in the past decades.
Several related or similar species have been described, such as L. percandidum with a
white or whitish pileus that becomes pale brownish when mature, L. roseotinctum, with
an initially white pileus that changes to pinkish when mature, L. cerinum with a paler
orange to yellowish pileus and pale, yellowish white pores in young basidiocarps, and
L. callit-richum with a more or less ochre pileus and dark brown elements in the
pileipellis. The outcome of the molecular studies (Den Bakker et al., 2004a, 2004b)
indicate, however, that a broad morphological species concept of L. versipelle fits
better with these results. No consistent morphological and molecular characters sup-
port the recognition of species like L. cerinum and L. callitrichum. The collections of
L. roseotinctum and L. percandidum showed sequences that were (almost) identical to the#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum atrostipitatum A.H. Sm., Thiers & Watling is an originally North Ameri-
can taxon that has been reported repeatedly from Europe (Engel, 1978) based on the
observation of fruit-bodies with an extremely dark and very dense stipital ornamenta-
tion. Several European and American collections identified as L. atrostipitatum have
been studied, but no significant morphological differences between these collections
and European material of L. versipelle could be found. ITS2 sequences show some
consistent differences between North American and European collections. We therefore
think that these differences represent infraspecific, phylogeographic differences and
L. atrostipitatum and L. versipelle are actually conspecific. Further North American
collections should be studied and sequenced to verify this assumption. Given the fact
that L. versipelle also occurs in the arctic we consider L. versipelle a Betula-associate
with a circumboreal distribution.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum scabrum can usually be distinguished from other species of subsection
Scabra by a combination of the following characters:#Misc-exposition*]

[@— the stipital ornamentation is usually coarse in the lower part of the stipe and with
fine, sometimes almost ‘glandular’ squamules in the upper half of the stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@— bluish discolorations of the context are always absent.#Misc-exposition*]

[@— the presence of remarkably large (up to 92 µm long), usually clavate caulocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@— the pileipellis is a loose cutis composed of a mixture of slender and broad, sometimes
elliptical, elements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum scabrum generally occurs in drier habitats than other species of subsec-
tion Scabra. Thanks to monographs like the one of Lannoy & Estades (1995) there is a
general consensus about the identity of L. scabrum. The current concept, however, of
L. scabrum is wider than that of Lannoy & Estades, and includes also L. roseofractum,
L. avellaneum and L. rigidipes, thus including also forms with discolouring context. As
such, L. scabrum is a fairly variable species, and L. avellaneum and L. roseofractum may
be considered the extremes in a series of lighter to darker forms. Gradual differences
were also found in the discoloration of the context when bruised, ranging from not re-
acting to discolouring pinkish to almost reddish. To consolidate the presently accepted
interpretation of L. scabrum an epitype accompanying the iconotype, originating from
the neighbourhood of Paris, is designated here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Europe, the slender spores (Q,, 2 3.0) can help to separate L. scabrum from
L. rotundifoliae. However, the average Q-value of collections identified as L. scabrum
from eastern North America is lower than the average Q-value in Europe, viz. 2.8 in-
stead of 3.0. Therefore the average Q-value can probably not be used in North America
to discriminate this species from Z. rotundifoliae. In North America the large caulo-
cystidia and the irregular pileipellis structure can be used to distinguish L. scabrum from
L. rotundifoliae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Watling (1968) L. roseofractum differs from L. scabrum by the more
robust habit, dark-coloured pileus, the dense black stipital ornamentation and flesh
changing distinctly red. Collections were made of L. roseofractum in Scotland, Norway
and Canada. The European collections matched all of Watling’s criteria for L. roseo-
fractum; the Canadian collection, however, had a slender habit, but a strong reddish
discoloration, an almost blackish pileus and dark blackish stipital ornamentation. The
three collections did not form a separate clade in our molecular phylogenetic analysis
(Fig. 2), but were found dispersed between accessions of L. scabrum. Microscopically
these collections and the type collection of L. roseofractum were not different either
from collections identified as L. scabrum. Therefore L. roseofractum is considered a
synonym of L. scabrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type material and original description of Orton (1988) of L. rigidipes is remi-
niscent of L. scabrum in almost every morphological character, except for the presence
of short hyphal elements (interpreted as cylindrocysts by Lannoy & Estades, 1995) in
the pileipellis. Specimens with abundant cylindrocysts, identified as L. rigidipes, were
molecularly identical with collections without cylindrocysts. Moreover, we noted that
cylindrocysts, though in low numbers, arc often present in the pileipellis of L. scabrum.
In conclusion, L. rigidipes is also considered synonymous with L. scabrum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name L. subcinnamomeum is validly published, since Pilat and Dermek referred

[@Leccinum melaneum does not differ morphologically much from L. scabrum, except
for the fact that the stipital surface generally is greyish or blackish in this species, as
opposed to whitish to brownish in L. scabrum. Three of the four collections also show
an unusually broad stipe base (giving the stipe a broadly clavate shape) and a slightly
malformed pileus. Molecular data indicate L. melaneum might be a hybridogenic taxon
(Den Bakker et al., in prep). In PRM several collections identified as L. melaneum by
Pilät are present, however, as far as we know no type material for L. melaneum has been

[@Leccinum rotundifoliae is a species of arctic, alpine, boreal and subalpine habitats.
Pale-coloured fruit-bodies can be distinguished from L. holopus by the absence of blu-
ish discolorations in the context of the stipe base, and the absence of greenish bluish
tinges in the pileus of older fruit-bodies. In addition to differences in colour there seems
to be an ecological difference in arctic regions. Leccinum rotundifoliae is a species of
dry habitats, whereas L. holopus preters wet habitats. In subalpine and boreal regions
L. rotundifoliae can also be found in wetter habitats.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The concept of L. rotundifoliae of Smith et al. (1967) differs from the original de-
scription of L. rotundifoliae. Singer's original diagnosis states that the context does not#Misc-exposition*]

[@change colour when bruised. Smith et al. (l.c.) described a pale, small species with a
bluish discoloration of the context in the stipe base. Collections from arctic environ-
ments fitting the concept of Smith et al., thus with a bluish discoloration in the stipe
base, appeared, however, in phylogenetic analyses in clades together with L. holopus
(see Figs. 2, 3), and not in the L. rotundifoliae clade. In fact, the concept of Smith et al.
actually represents an arctic phenotype of L. holopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These two different concepts of L. rotundifoliae have coexisted for some time in the
literature and have generated abundant confusion. Kallio (1975), who was among the
first to realise that two different arctic species were involved, followed the interpretation
of L. rotundifoliae by Smith et al. when describing L. scabrum subsp. tundrae. He listed
a number of morphological and ecological differences between L. rotundifoliae and
L. scabrum subsp. tundrae, from which is apparent that his concept of L. rotundifoliae
fits that of Smith et al., while the description of L. scabrum subsp. tundrae perfectly fits
the present concept of L. rotundifoliae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum rotundifoliae is generally considered a pale brown to almost whitish spe-
cies. However, specimens with a dark pileus and dark stipital squamules were also
sequenced. The first of these specimens to be sequenced (a collection from Borgsjó,
Jümtland, Sweden) was erroneously called L. scabrum (Den Bakker et al., 2004a) based
on the minor sequence divergence in ITS between L. scabrum and L. rotundifoliae.
Analysis of an additional gene (Gapdh), however, supported the recognition of L. rotun-
difoliae as a separate species. When type material of L. pulchrum was sequenced, these
accessions surprisingly appeared in the L. rotundifoliae-clade. Upon closer inspection
of the morphology and a comparison of photographs of dark specimens of L. rotun-
difoliae from Greenland and Sweden with the picture of L. pulchrum in Estades & Lannoy
(2004: 62) these pictures show a perfect resemblance. Leccinum pulchrum is therefore
reduced into the synonymy of L. rotundifoliae. This demonstrates that L. rotundi-
foliae not only occurs in Northern Europe, but also in the Alps. One accession from
the French lowlands which was identified as L. pulchrum, appeared, however, in the
L.scabrum clade. Morphological data confirmed that the collection belongs to L. scabrum,
and the name that was initially provided (L. pulchrum) must therefore be considered
a misapplication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In their description of L. pulchrum, Lannoy & Estades (1995) stated that occasionally
bluish discolorations can be found in the stipe base. A collection from a marshy birch forest
in the Netherlands fitted their discription well with respect to this character. But the mo-
lecular and microscopic characters placed this collection in the current concept of L. holo-
pus. This normally pale-coloured species usually has bluish discolorations in the stipe
base. It has been collected in the same locality as the above mentioned L. pulchrum and
ended up in the same clade. Apparently the concept of L. pulchrum by Lannoy & Estades
is merely based on non-diagnostic macroscopical characters, and represents a mixture of
different species, including L. scabrum, L. rotundifoliae and L. holopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum variicolor can be easily recognized in the field on account of its variegated
pileus and distinct blue-green discoloration of the context of the stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species occurs in North America and could even be locally common, given the
fact that the first author observed that this was one of the most common species of the
subsection Scabra at the Cain Foray (Mycological Society of Toronto) near Huntsville
(Ontario, Canada) and on Manitoulin Island (Ontario, Canada) in the fall of 2003. It has
long been unnoticed because it has been confused with L. snellii. Both species have a
similar discoloration of the context, and also the septate caulocystidia, that were thought
to be diagnostic for L. snellii (Smith et al., 1967) are found in L. variicolor. Molecu-
larly, however, the two species cannot even be considered closely related (Den Bakker
et al., in prep.). Based on a limited number of herbarium collections and the original
description of L. snellii, the most important differences are found in the pileipellis, in
particular in the shape of the terminal elements. The pileipellis of L. snellii is charac-
terized by the presence of 8— 10 µm broad cylindrical elements and clavate to conical,
terminal elements with dark brown vacuolar pigment. The pileipellis of L. variicolor
is also characterized by the presence of short, cylindrical hyphal elements, but usually
they are less broad (4.5 — 9.0 µm) and the terminal elements are conical. In particular the
clavate terminal elements are distinctive for L. snellii, and have never been found in
L. variicolor. There may also be an ecological difference between the two taxa. In the
Great Lakes region of Canada the first author generally found L. variicolor in the same
habitat as in Europe, viz. in humid, acidic habitats. Leccinum snellii was found only once,
and in a completely different habitat, viz. a rich, slightly humid forest on alkaline soil.
The locality of the specimens on which the original description of L. snellii is based can
also be interpreted as a rich forest, consisting of beech, maple and yellow birch. More
study is needed to understand the morphological delimitation of these two species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lannoy & Estades (1995) recognized three infraspecic taxa within L. variicolor.
viz. var. bertauxii differing from var. variicolor by an evenly coloured blackish pileus
and the absence of pinkish discolorations of the context in stipe and pileus, f. atrostel-
Jatum, differing from the typical form by a dark star-shaped pattern on the pileus, and
f. sphagnorum, a form with uniformly coloured brownish pileus. Since all these character
states fall within the normal range of variability of L. variicolor examined during this
study, these taxa are not considered of taxonomic value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum cyaneobasileucum is easily recognized already in the field by the generally
dull-coloured greyish brown pileus and woolly stipital surface. Pale and albino forms
occur, which is confirmed by phylogenetic comparison of ITS and Gapdh sequences
of material of L. brunneogriseolum and L. cyaneobasileucum. These pale and albinistic
forms can be confused with L. holopus in the field, but differ from this taxon by their
slender spores (Q,, z 3.0), and the abundant cylindrocysts in the pileipellis. Due to the
fact that the name L. cyaneobasileucum was published earlier than L. brunneogriseolum,
the first name has priority and, unfortunately, has to replace the latter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lannoy & Estades (1995) recognized two infraspecific taxa within L. brunneogri-
seolum, viz. var. pubescentium, a variety that differs from var. brunneogriseolum by a
darker brown pileus and a robust stipe, and f. chlorinum a form that shows olivaceous
colours in the margin in older fruit-bodies and also olivaceous, greenish tinges in the
stipe. Darker brown pilei fall within the variability of the species, and greenish tinges
like in f. chlorinum can also be observed in other taxa when they form fruit-bodies dur-

[@The typical form of L. holopus is a slender, pale, almost whitish bolete, without any
clear discoloration of the context when bruised, occurring in Sphagnum-bogs in mon-
tane, sub-boreal and boreal regions. Another, sturdier form with a darker, sometimes
brownish pileus, darker stipital ornamentation and bluish discolorations in the stipe
base, is found in wet, acidic birch woods. This last form has been described as a separate
species by Lannoy & Estades (1993) as L. nucatum. No molecular evidence to support
the existence of L. nucatum as a separate species was found. Moreover, the differences
between both forms are not always clearcut and intermediates occur. For this reason
the nucatum-type populations do not justify a formal taxonomic status and L. nucatum
is placed into the synonymy of L. holopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum holopus can be distinguished from related taxa by a combination of the
following microscopic characters: a pileipellis that is composed of slender hyphal ele-
ments of relatively even diameter (3.5-5.0 µm), abundant cylindrical caulocystidia
with a flexuose neck in the lower half of the stipe and an average Q-value of spores s
2.8.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smith & Thiers (1971) recognized two varieties of L. holopus: var. holopus and var.
americanum. According to Smith & Thiers var. americanum mainly differs from var.
holopus in the pinkish reddish discoloration of the context when bruised and the blackish
stipe ornamentation. Both varieties have been observed in the field by the first author in
Canada, sometimes close together on the same spot. Though no molecular differences
could be found that were congruent with these varieties, no intermediates were observed
in the field. The absence of (morphological) intermediates seems to justify recognition
of var. americanum as an infraspecific taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most distinctive characters of L. crocipodium are the rather yellow pores.
combined with the blackening context. It is the only species with this combination of
characters known from temperate regions in Europe, where it has a preference for ther-
mophilous deciduous forests. The macroscopically similar L. corsicum and L. lepidum
have an exclusive Mediterranean distribution, and are associated with Cistus spp. and
Quercus ilex respectively. Leccinum crocipodium has only recently been discovered
in the Netherlands in 1999, with a second observation in 2001. Whether this may be
due to climate changes, or whether it has been overlooked in the past, is difficult to
ascertain.#Misc-exposition*]

for the species is L. pseudoscabrum. Note that there is no connection between the name
of the species and the subsection Pseudoscabra, an artificial assemblage of species
characterized by cylindrocysts. The name L. griseum has also been used for this spe-
cies. However, the basionym Gyroporus griseus Quél. is a superfluous name change
for Boletus scaber.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Den Bakker & Noordeloos: A revision of European spectes of Leccinum 571#Page-header*]

[@Ever since Fries (Syst. mycol., Ind. gen., 1832), Boletus fuscoalbus has been con-
sidered a synonym of L. scabrum or as a closely related species. The protologue by
Sowerby (“inside white, sometimes changing to brown, or even black on exposure by
cutting in the air, especially if in a tender state or bruised”) makes clear that the name
is more likely an older name for L. pseudoscabrum or L. duriusculum. Since there
are apparently four different interpretations for Bolerus fuscoalbus/B. leucophaeus (a
synonym of L. scabrum; a closely related species to L. scabrum; L. pseudoscabrum;
L. duriusculum), it seems best to consider the name as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description of Bon (1984) and Lannoy & Estades (1995) is applicable to a number
of species since the greenish tinges and discolorations represent a character complex that
is commonly encountered in several species of subsection Scabra when the fruit-bod-
ies have developed during a cool, humid period. The type material is in poor condition
and not sufficiently well-preserved to study its molecular and microscopical characters.
The spores could be measured and have an average Q-value of 3.1, which is typical for
L. scabrum. lt is excluded as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The holotype of L. murinaceum (Blum 750, PC) is in very poor condition, and imma-
ture, and it proved to be impossible to study any molecular or morphological characters.
The original diagnosis of Blum (1970) does not offer much help to clarify the identity
of this taxon either. The interpretation of Lannoy & Estades (1995: 68) comes close
to the current concept of L. melaneum. According to these authors L. murinaceum is
not only mycorrhizal with Berula, but also with Salix, a mycorrhizal association that is
exceptional in subsection Scabra. It is considered a nomen dubium for these reasons.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leccinum olivaceosum Lannoy & Estades, Doc. Mycol. 24 (94) (1994) 10.#Nomenclature*]

[@The type material is in poor condition and could not be used for further study. The plates of
Lannoy & Estades (1995) show a species that looks macro-morphologically like L. holopus
and L. schistophilum. A molecular study by Binder (1999) based on material provided by the
authors shows that its ribosomal sequences are reminiscent of those of L. holopus. Further

[@The original description L. oxydabile is equally applicable to L. holopus, L. variicolor,
L. cyaneobasileucum, L. snellii and L. schistophilum. Unfortunately, no type material
was designated by Singer. According to Hahn (1997) L. oxydabile is a taxon with a#Misc-exposition*]

[@brownish pileus, a stipe base that sometimes shows traces of blue, and which has broad
(up to 20 µm) pileipellis elements. This decription comes close to L. cyaneobasileucum.
Hahn described the stipe, however, as greyish brown to blackish, which is atypical for
L. cyaneobasileucum. Another option would be that L. oxydabile sensu Hahn represents
L. schistophilum, but the broad pileipellis elements do not fit with our interpretation of
that species. Given the confusion associated with the name L. oxydabile (Hahn, 1996),
we think it is better to abandon the name and consider it a nomen confusum.#Misc-exposition*]

our current concept of L. vulpinum, L. versipelle and L. aurantiacum. Further use of the

Zealand vol. 1. (Fungal Diversity Press, Centre for Research in Fungal Diversity,
The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China; website http://www.hku.hk/
ecology/mycology/FDP.html. 2004.) ISBN 962-86765-6-3. Pp. 498; 16 coloured
plates. In English. Price: USD 80.00.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Surprisingly little is known about New Zealand’s fungi, of which many are believed
to be unique to New Zealand. The authors estimate that about 2/3 of the expected
22,000 species are unrecorded. This first volume seeks to provide a foundation for
understanding New Zealand's fungi, including taxonomic, ecological, historical and
cultural knowledge, along with inventories of recorded species. It is a cooperative
initiative by several New Zealand mycologists and a Swiss mycologist (Horak). The
next volumes will provide monographic treatments of selected taxonomic or ecological
groups of fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book starts with an abstract in English and Maori, and 16 coloured plates which
illustrate some of the more conspicuous, colourful and distinctive species found in New
Zealand. The first chapter of 48 pages gives a general introduction into the diversity
and ecological roles of fungi. Fungi are considered in a broad sense, i.e. including also
the fungus-like members of the Protozoa and Chromista. Attention is also drawn to the
endangered species of New Zealand. The following chapter gives an overview of the
history of taxonomic mycology in New Zealand (31 pages), which began about mid
1800. Chapter 3 reports on the Maori knowledge of fungi (37 pages), which dates from
considerably earlier. A key to the genera of agarics and boleti is given by Horak of 19
pages, followed by pages with references to descriptions, illustrations and keys. Chapter
5 counts 197 pages and contains a bibliographic checklist of agarics, boleti and related
fungi. Chapter 6 gives a bibliography of New Zealand taxonomic mycology (38 pages),
the last chapter gives a checklist of all New Zealand *Fungi' (87 pages), and the book
is completed with an index to Chapter 1—3.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is to be hoped that the start of this series will soon be followed by other volumes
with monographic treatments on fungi from this interesting part of the world. This first
volume is already a must for every mycological library and every mycologist inter-
ested.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This impressive and well-printed book is fully devoted to ascomycetes and basidio-
mycetes growing on dung. The author, Francesco Doveri, a practicing physician
and endocrinologist, spent more than 15 years on the study of fimicolous fungi in#Misc-exposition*]
[@Book reviews 589#Page-header*]

[@Italy. Several preliminary studies on these fungi were published in Italian and French
mycological periodicals, often in co-authorship with his compatriots G. Cacialli and
V. Caroti. During a period of 10 years 90 species of fimicolous basidiomycetes and
217 species of ascomycetes could be identified. A considerable amount of information
concerning recent studies in Italy and from many widely distributed studies and
monographs on these fungi is brought together in this book.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The introduction contains a practical guide to the study of coprophilous fungi with
advice how to grow them in culture and a list of animals that have proven to provide for
favourable substrate sources. An extensive glossary of terms concludes the introductory
part.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The descriptive chapters form the main part of this book (p. 29-1004). All texts, keys,
descriptions, and notes are presented in alternating blocks in English and Italian, which
makes the book widely available, also to mycologists who read Italian less easily. Suc-
cessively, coprophilous representatives of Gasteromycetes, Agaricales, Pezizomycetes,
Dothideomycetes, and Sordariomycetes are treated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As evident from the subtitle, conidial fungi, slime moulds and Zygomycetideae, often
forming an important aspect of the fungi found growing on dung, are not treated. All
keys, descriptions, and notes are presented as alternating blocks of English and Italian
text. Although this study is primarily based on collections found all over Italy, it is of
greater importance because most of the more than 300 coprophilous fungi described
have a very wide distribution and many keys include all species known world-wide.
Each species reported from Italy is presented with its name, an extensive alphabetic syn-
onymy, the original diagnosis as published, a list of specimens examined, macroscopic
and microscopic descriptions, and critical observations. A full page of clear microscopic
line-drawings is added.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On some occasions the author followed his own experience with his previous work
and deviates from results published elsewhere. So in the case of Jodophanus carneus,
contrary to Kimbrough et al. in their treatment of Jodophanus with many hardly separa-
ble taxa, Doveri accepts a rather wide conception of that species. But for the complete-
ness of information a key to 16 species of Jodophanus is presented. The work ends with
an impressive list of references (39 pages), an index with the full names and a series of
158 coloured photographs of good quality on special paper. This book is highly recom-
mended to those who are interested in fungi growing on dung or those who prepare
mycological courses for students.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is the continuation of the Entoloma part of the series Fungi Europaei which

[@key in English and Italian is published. The species are treated the same way as before,
with elaborate bilingual descriptions and are mostly accompanied by drawings of the
essential microscopical characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Supplement starts with an introduction of 4 pages and an enumeration of the
species of Entoloma according to section and subsection of 6 pages. The revised key
occupies 61 pages, the taxonomical part 320 pages, the referencelist is 5 pages. On an-
other 200 pages the 342 coloured photographs are found. The book is completed with
an index to the Supplement and part 5 together.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first impression is of a well-produced book with nice photographs, as we are
used to from Candusso. The keys are greatly improved: more species with conspicuous
characters, for example species with small thin-walled spores, are keyed out first. The
lay-out of the keys is the same as in part 5: by way of a main key the user is referred to
17 other keys. The coloured plates are usually of (very) good quality, but do not depict
all the newly described species. Sometimes species are depicted of which no picture
was available for part 5. Although this Supplement is a must for each mycologist with a
slight interest in Agaricales, some critical remarks can be made: the species in the book
are renumbered, and species described in the previous part 5 are only mentioned without
reference to the page where the description can be found. Of course the index can help,
but it would have been of great help if the page number was given straight away. Some
keys have annoying mistakes, and the line-drawings are not always of good quality.#Misc-exposition*]
