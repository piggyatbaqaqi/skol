[@IN MEMORIAM RUDOLF ARNOLD MAAS GEESTERANUS#Misc-exposition*]
[@DEN HAAG, 20 JANUARY 1911- OEGSTGEEST, 18 MAY 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@On 18 May 2003 Rudolf Maas Geesteranus died peacefully at the age of 92. With him
the mycological world has lost a remarkable and versatile personality, who worked
on the taxonomy of fungi for almost 60 years producing papers and books on a wide
range of topics, including both asco- and basidiomycetes. The bibliographical notes
and publication list printed in this journal on his retirement from active service at
the Rijksherbarium in 1976, and on his eightieth birthday in 1991 (Bas, Persoonia 8
(1976) 335—343, and Persoonia 14 (1992) 353—356) reflect the extent of his profes-
sional interests and output during his long career. After 1991 Maas Geesteranus went
on tirelessly, producing another set of papers on the genus Mycena, which was his main
interest in his last years of mycological activities. Milestones in this period were the
two volumes of the Mycenas of the Northern Hemisphere (1992), a compilation of his
vast knowledge of the genus, and a monograph of the Mycenas occurring in the state of
Paraná, Brazil, produced in close cooperation with André de Meijer (1997). Although
Maas Geesteranus retired from active mycology a few years ago, he was well and active
until his death, still very much engaged with his hobbies, such as the study of minerals,
butterflies, and painting.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rudolf Maas Geesteranus will be remembered not only as an outstanding mycologist,
but above all as a kind and helpful man, who advised and stimulated several genera-
tions of mycologists, both professional and amateur. For this we are very grateful. Our
thoughts are with Martha, his wife, and his children and grandchildren, who will miss
him dearly.#Misc-exposition*]

[@IN MEMORIAM KEES (C.B.) ULJE (1939-2003)#Misc-exposition*]

[@On 6 April 2003 a tragic accident led to the untimely death of Kees Uljé, mycologist
and active member of the Netherlands’ Mycological Society. Kees’ first contact with
mycology dated back some twenty years ago when, not being able to continue his pro-
fession as a roadworker, he became more and more interested in the study of agarics
and taxonomy. In the first few years he acquired a general knowledge of mushrooms
and toadstools, collecting and painting them in his own meticulous style, but gradually
he became more and more involved in the study of ink caps (Coprinus), eventually
becoming one of the world’s leading specialists in this taxonomically and ecologically
interesting and difficult group of fungi. This resulted not only in a series of popular
and scientific papers, but also in a network of personal contacts with mycologists all
over the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kees was typically a self-made man: with only a limited higher education, he nonethe-
less developed all the knowledge and skills necessary for his mycological studies. He
had a gift for drawing and made beautiful illustrations for his publications. His affinity
with computers and programming was put to good use to produce a unique website on
Coprinus, and to develop an identification program, which could be down-loaded from
his site, and not only served for the identification of ink caps, but also a wide range of
other genera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Above all Kees was a very sociable man, always willing to help other people and
pass on his knowledge, without any self-profit. As such he stimulated the interest of
many people, not only in the Netherlands’ Mycological Society, but all over the world
through the Internet.#Misc-exposition*]

[@His contribution to the Flora agaricina neerlandica on the genus Coprinus will be
published in due course. We will also try to keep his website on line and up to date. As
such we will commemorate and honour this remarkable person.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our thoughts are with Ida, his wife, and his children and grandchildren, who still
have great difficulties to accept his untimely passing away.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper is the final one of a series of Contributions’ to be included in a monographic
treatment of the anamorphic genus Phoma based on cultural characteristics. To facilitate
the identification the genus has been divided into nine sections; see Boerema, 1997 for
their differentiating characteristics and keys.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Those previously treated are the sections Phoma (De Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992;
De Gruyter et al., 1993, 1998), Peyronellaea (Boerema, 1993), Plenodomus (Boerema et
al., 1994, 1996; Boerema & de Gruyter, 1999), Heterospora (Boerema et al. 1997, 1999),
Sclerophomella (Boerema & de Gruyter, 1998), Phyllostictoides (Van der Aa et al.,
2000; De Gruyter et al., 2002), Paraphoma (De Gruyter & Boerema, 2002) and Macro-
spora (De Gruyter, 2002).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phoma sect. Pilosa Boerema et al. (Boerema, 1997) treated in this paper, is based on
Phoma betae A.B. Frank, anamorph of Pleospora betae (Berl.) Nevod., well known as a
seedborne pathogen of Beta vulgaris and other Chenopodiaceae (Boerema et al., 1987).
The section name refers to the ‘hairy’ or pilose appearance of the globose pscudopa-
renchymatous pycnidia of this anamorph in vitro (Fig. 1A). They are initially closed,
with late development of a pore (sometimes V-shaped according to Monte & Garcia-
Acha, 1988a: 236), instead of a predetermined ostiole. In vivo the pycnidia usually
develop beneath the cuticle and look glabrous with a flush circular central opening
(Shoemaker & Bissett, 1998). The subglobose-ellipsoidal conidia of P. betae are one-
celled, but, when germination is initiated, the conidium sometimes becomes 1-septate
(Monte & Garcia-Acha, 1988c). Electron microscope observations on the conidiogenesis
(Monte & Garcia-Acha, 1988b) show a conidial ontogeny similar to that in other species
of Phoma. Only the intermediate layer in the papilla preceding the initiation of the first
conidium (Boerema, 1997) could not be observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this extensive publication the taxa described in Phyllosticta are enumerated, based on
literature and herbarium species, type-specimens and living isolates. It is the result of
the studies made by the first author during most of his long career at the CBS in Utrecht
(formerly Baarn), but the project was originally initiated by the late Dr. J.A. von Arx. The
annotated list of accepted species in Phyllosticta, including several new combinations in
Phyllosticta, and the much longer annotated list of species which have been redisposed
and transferred to other genera are impressive. The book offers a short introduction
to the genus Phyllosticta and its current taxonomic position among the amerosporous
Coelomycetes. A key is given to some of these genera which are important for clarifying
this, followed by an overview of the genera concerned with nomenclatural notes and
descriptions of their principal characters. After two chapters dealing with methods and
material, the main part of the book is devoted to an enumeration of species accepted in
Phyllosticta (34 pp.) and species excluded from the genus (Pp. 441 pp.!). A full list of
references concludes the book.#Misc-exposition*]

always thin-walled. Hymenophoral trama regular to somewhat irregular, with cells of
hyphae in central part often inflated, sometimes + dextrinoid. Subhymenium narrow,
rather dense, from ramose to almost cellular. Pileipellis varying from a simple cutis in
some species to an irregular hymeniderm in others, often two-layered and then the thin
and inconspicuous to very distinct suprapellis a cutis made up of comparatively narrow
hyphae, rarely with distinct pileocystidia, and the usually very prominent subpellis made
up of radially to disorderly arranged chains of inflated cells. Pigments predominantly
parietal but minute incrustations reported by some collectors (not observed in dried
material, possibly disappearing in NH4OH and KOH). Caulocystidia present at least
at apex of stipe, clavate, subcylindrical to filiform, or irregularly shaped, thin-walled,
scattered to very crowded. Context of stipe and pileus continuous. Trama of stipe regu-
lar, composed of cylindrical, thin- to slightly thick-walled, frequently septate hyphae.
Clamp-connections usually present in several or all tissues, sometimes completely
lacking, in one species restricted to basidia and subhymenium. In KOH 5% pileipellis
fragments not or hardly changing colour or becoming violet, green, yellow or brownish
with such tinges, rarely first red then yellow-green; other parts of basidiocarps may show
similar colour changes (insufficiently investigated). In several species tissues more or
less dextrinoid (insufficiently investigated).#Description*]

[@Habitat & distribution — Terrestrial, probably non-mycorrhizal, on needle carpets
of conifers, humus, forest litter, wooden debris, once on a fallen branch, among mosses
and grasses (and then sometimes deeply hidden in the vegetation), but also sometimes
on bare soil, most species seemingly preferring calcareous and/or nutrient-rich soils,
but some occurring on peaty soil, from sea level to the subalpine (or even alpine?) zone,
in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions; probably cosmopolitan, in literature
reported from Europe, North and South America, and central and southern Asia; in
Europe fruiting mainly from August - November, very rarely in July and December.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most important emendation of the generic description concerns the greater vari-
ation in pileipellis structures. Two species even appeared to have a hymenidermoid
pileipellis of erect inflated cells, which looks round-celled when seen from above.
Moreover a few species have perfect cheilocystidia and one evident pileocystidia. A
wide range of colour changes of the pileipellis in KOH 5% offers a new set of useful
characters. However, the unity of the genus can hardly be doubted in view of the unique
small spores becoming thick-walled and dextrinoid after their liberation from the basidia.
Only the genus Rhodocollybia Singer (Antonin & Noordeloos, 1997) has similar but
usually larger spores, larger basidiocarps with a simple cutis or more often an ixocutis
and a pinkish yellow to pinkish brown, never white spore print.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some special observations should be mentioned here: some authors record coloured
spore prints, e.g. Favre (1960) for what probably is true P. pillodii ("sporée nettement
lilacin-pourpré"), but that is not the case for the few collections with a spore print or
with notes on the spore print colour studied by the author.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the single collection of P. oligophylla in its present concept, the collector,
N. Dam, noted that some rhizoids were connected with small ochraceous tubers in the

[@TAXONOMIC POSITION OF THE GENUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudobaeospora oligophylla, the type species, was originally placed by Singer
(1938) in Baeospora. Later Singer (1942) excluded this species with dextrinoid spores
from Baeospora (with amyloid spores) and placed it in the new genus Pseudobaeospora,
then thought to belong to the Tricholomataceae (* Marasmioideae"). But in the first edi-
tion of his *Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy' Singer (1951) moved Pseudobaeospora
to Agaricaceae tribus Lepioteae. Even in the latest edition of the same work Singer
(1986) maintained the genus in the Agaricaceae (but then in tribus Cystodermateae),
very recently still followed by Wasser (2002). Kühner (1980), citing good reasons, had
already restored the genus in the Tricholomataceae, and this placement was followed
by Bas (1995) and Kirk et al. (2001).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is not quite clear what made Singer place Pseudobaeospora close to Lepiota. One
would expect that the dextrinoid nature of the thickened mature spore wall would be
stressed as an important argument, but that is not the case. Pseudobaeospora was consid-
ered by Singer (1963) to be closely related to the Lepiota sericea group (= Sericeomyces
Heinemann, 1978); even to such an extent that Locquin’s (1952) transfer of this group
to Pseudobaeospora was accepted by him (Singer, 1975). This taxonomic solution has
been strongly opposed by Kühner (1980: 146) and finally rejected by Singer (1986) too,
when he excluded again the L. sericea group from Pseudobaeospora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Morphological arguments for placing Pseudobaeospora in the Tricholomataceae
are (1) the shape of the basidiocarp, which is more collybioid than lepiotoid; (2) the at-
tachment of the lamellae, which is only exceptionally free, but mostly emarginate, and
sometimes even adnate; (3) the absence of any sign of a veil (but the ontogeny of the
basidiocarp has not yet been studied); and (4) the continuous context of stipe and pileus.
The fact that the spores of Pseudobaeospora become secondarily thick-walled does not
hold as an argument against this option, as thickening spore walls becoming dextrinoid
occur also elsewhere in the Tricholomataceae, e.g. in Rhodocollybia, where, judging
by the five European species described by Antonin & Noordeloos (1997: 119-135),
viz. R. maculata (Alb. & Schwein.: Fr.) Singer, R. prolixa (Hornem.: Fr.) Antonin &
Noordel., R. fodiens (Kalchbr.) Antonin & Noordel., R. filamentosa (Velen.) Antonin,
and R. butyracea (Bolt.: Fr.) Lennox, it might be a generic character too.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Molecular studies on P. pyrifera, and a comparison with members of the A garicaceae
showed that it does not belong to this family, but that its position is still unclear, as the
LSU sequence is close to those of Thaxteromyces and Nolanea species (Vellinga, 2003).
As only P. pyrifera was included in Vellinga’s studies, it is premature to draw conclu-
sions for the genus as a whole.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the moment the best solution seems to accept Pseudobaeospora as a member of
the Tricholomataceae and to place it there near Collybia and its relatives.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of its minute and slender basidiocarps, its strongly translucently striate pileus
when moist, and its pileipellis constructed as an irregular hymeniderm, P. celluloderma
is very well characterized. The only other species with a hymenidermoid pileipellis is
P. mutabilis Adamcík & Bas, but that has cheilocystidia, somewhat larger and more
sturdy basidiocarps (pileus 7-13 mm wide, stipe 20—30 x 1-2 mm) and slightly smaller

[@Pseudobaeospora dichroa is a small, comparatively sturdy, dark species, easily
recognized when a scalp or a radial section of the pileipellis is observed in KOH. The
colour change from red to yellow-green is very striking, but has been tested only on
dried material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the type of forma dichroa no cheilocystidia have been observed and in the type
of forma cystidiata they are abundant and evident, so the formal description of a forma
seems justified. However, the discovery of a few cheilocystidioid cells in K(M) 8101,
inserted here in forma dichroa, renders its status somewhat shaky.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present concept of P. pillodü is based on that of Kühner in Kühner & Romagnesi
(1954) and Horak (1968). Probably the type of Quélet’s Collybia pillodii does not exist
and Quélet’s illustration and very concise original description are difficult to interpret,
particularly after the recent increase of the number of species in the genus. However,
there is nothing in the description and the illustration that excludes the present concept,
except the surface of the spores that is described as minutely spinulose (‘finement
aculéolée"). But as the spores of all species of the genus examined by the author are
glabrous under the light microscope (in the only species tested, also in SEM), Quélet
was probably mistaken.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudobaeospora pillodii is characterized by very small to small, very slender, col-
oured basidiocarps, lacking clamp-connections (even from the basidia), broadly ellipsoid
spores (3.7-4.5 x 2.9-3.6 µm, average Q = 1.15-1.25), and a pileipellis composed of
fairly broad, radial hyphae, with or without a suprapellis of narrow hyphae, and lacking
pileocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although specimens have been found with 2-spored basidia only, nothing is gained
by formally describing a 2-spored variety or forma, as specimens occur with 2- and
4- spored basidia sometimes even on one lamella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The very similar P. oligophylla in its present sense differs from P. pillodii mainly in
à pileipellis with many repent to ascending, pileocystidioid terminal cells. It could very
well represent a variety of P. pillodii (the oldest name of the two). However, although in
Singer's diagnosis of P. oligophylla such a pileipellis is rather precisely described, its
type has not yet been analysed. Therefore, at the moment it seems unwise to introduce
à new combination.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudobaeospora pillodii may have a much wider range of distribution than indi-
cated above, as the name occurs in quite a few publications. But there is little sense in
recording all these reports here, as the available data are often insufficient for a positive
identification. Pseudobaeospora pillodii sensu Redhead (1982) from Canada might
represent perhaps P. oligophylla, because of the presence of rather simple pileocystidia
(unfortunately the absence or presence of clamp-connections is not mentioned).#Misc-exposition*]

[@When Singer (1938) described the present species as Baeospora oligophylla, ap-
parently he had never seen Pseudobaeospora pillodii (Quél.) Wasser, described 48
years earlier by Quélet (1890) as Collybia pillodii. He merely noted that that species
probably belongs to the genus Baeospora too. There has been quite a bit of speculation
about the relation between P. pillodii and P. oligophylla and some authors. e.g. Horak
(1968), considered these only two clampless European taxa conspecific. This is quite
understandable, when Singer's description is compared with the descriptions of P. pil-
lodii in its current concept.#Misc-exposition*]
[@196 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, there is one element in that description that seems to have escaped atten-
tion, viz. Singer's description of the suprapellis, which disagrees with P. pillodii. Dr.
R.A. Maas Geesteranus (in litt.) kindly translated it from Latin as follows: "... terminal
cells somewhat erect, clavate to cylindrical and obtusely rounded, very rarely inflated
to globules, but usually repent, filiform or in chains ...", and he added a small sketch
showing what he thought the suprapellis would look like and which agrees very well
with the suprapellis of the present collection as illustrated here. But the very rare glob-
ules mentioned by Singer have not been found. In the basidiocarps of P. pillodii cited in
this paper pileocystidioid structures are lacking completely. Unfortunately, the present
author has not been enabled to examine the type of P. oligophylla, that, if it exists, is
presumably kept in LE.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collector of the material described above, observed that some of the rhizoids
were connected to very small ochre-yellow grains in the soil “like those of Collybia
cookei, but a bit smaller”, but there were also grains scattered in the soil not connected
to rhizoids. It is very uncertain whether these grains belong to the species or not, but
that possibility should not be excluded.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For a taxonomic study of a genus like Pseudobaeospora, with its many apparently rare species with
their often tiny, inconspicuous basidiocarps, the help of many collectors is a must. Very few European
mycologists have seen more than two species of Pseudobaeospora fresh. Lothar Krieglsteiner must
have a special eye for them, because he provided me with well-annotated collections of six species,
for which I am very grateful. Special thanks are also due to Thomas Lzessoe, who besides sending
in his personal collections of three species, drew the author's attention to the crucial collections of
Pseudobaeospora from England gathered by Alick Henrici, J. C. Leedal, and L. Livermore, conserved
in the mycological herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. These were kindly made available
for the present project by the Director of that Institute.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mycoflora of Nepal, a remote and not easily accessible country, has been poorly
known so far. This book offers a welcome compilation of current knowledge, brought
together by the author, and supplemented with his extensive own research. Introductory
chapters deal with the phytogeography and climate, followed by an overview of the
history of mycology in Nepal so far. The main part of the book is devoted to an annotated
list of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes found in Nepal, giving details on distribution
and sometimes substrate, together with references of the records. The genera Amanita,
Russula, and Lactarius are treated in more detail with notes on the characters and keys
for identification. Also of the Gasteromycetes a key is given to the genera. Chapters
are added on ethnomycology, the value of mushrooms for food and trade, and the book
concludes with an extensive chapter on mycobiogeography, comparing the mycoflora
of Nepal with other regions of the world, ecological factors affecting the mycoflora,
and distribution patterns. A few pages are added on conservation and utilization. The
coloured photographs are informative, though not always of very good quality. The
book is recommended as an important source of information on this region we know
so little about.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bolbitius titubans var. titubans is a common and well-characterized agaric, in general
better known with the name Bolbitius vitellinus. Both names Agaricus titubans and
A. vitellinus were sanctioned by Fries but the former name has priority since it is based
on the oldest name, viz. Agaricus titubans Bull. (Herb. France: 425, 1789).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many authors distinguish two or three taxa (species, subspecies or varieties) within
Bolbitius titubans. For instance, Moser (1983) distinguished var. vitellinus with a deep
yellow pileus, white stipe and spores measuring 12—13 x 6—7 µm, var. titubans with a
lemon-yellow, deeply striate pileus, yellowish stipe and spores measuring 13-15 x 7-9
jam and var. fragilis with a lemon-yellow pileus striate at margin only, yellowish stipe
and spores measuring 9—12 x 6—7 µm. Watling (1982) and Bon (1992) distinguished
B. titubans and B. vitellinus as different species. B. titubans sensu stricto is said to
be characterized by small basidiocarps with strongly striate, bright yellow pileus and
yellow stipe; B. vitellinus by larger basidiocarps with the pileus striate at margin only
and a white stipe. Cetto (1989) and Courtecuisse & Duhem (1994) described these two
taxa as varieties of a single species. On the other hand, Enderle et al. (1985) argued
that all three taxa are only phenotypic variants of a single species without taxonomic
relevance. Their opinion was shared by Ryman & Holmásen (1984), Gerhardt (1997)
and others.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the basis of extensive studies of collections from the Netherlands I support the
view that there is only one, variable species. The size of the basidiocarps is quite var-
iable indeed with an expanded pileus ranging from 10—65 mm diameter. This variation
can be explained by differences in nutrient status of the substrate (Enderle et al., 1985).
Large basidiocarps were usually collected from heaps of dung or wood chips, small
basidiocarps from dead grass remains or manured soil. Similar variation is found in
other coprophytic species, for instance in Psilocybe semiglobata (Batsch: Fr.) Noordel.
with a pileus size ranging from 3-30 mm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is true that in general the pileus of smaller basidiocarps is paler yellow and
stronger striate than the pileus of larger basidiocarps, but this is a normal phenomenon#Misc-exposition*]
[@204 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@among agarics. No correlation between yellow colours on the stipe and the size of basi-
diocarps was found. The spore size showed considerable variation with a minimum size
of (8.5-)9.5-11.5 x 6.0-7.5 µm, on average 10.4 x 6.7 µm (collection Arnolds 7114,
WBS) and a maximum of 10.5-15.0 x 6.0-9.0 µm, on average 12.5 x 7.3 µm (collec-
tion P.B. Jansen 82-240, L) (Fig. 1). However, a continuous range of collections with
intermediate spore size exist. Spore size is correlated neither with the size of basidiocarps
(Fig. 1), nor with any other morphological character. Conclusively, there is no reason to
distinguish several (intraspecific) taxa on the basis of morphological characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bolbitius titubans var. olivaceus is often regarded as a separate species under the
well-known, correct name B. variicolor, for instance by Watling (1982), Furrer-Ziogas
(1990), Courtecuisse & Duhem (1992). Bolbitius variicolor is said to differ in (1) duller
colours of the pileus, ranging from olive-brown to olivaceous yellow or brownish yellow
when young; (2) the pileus surface that is often darker brown radially rugulose or reticu-
late at centre; and (3) regular occurrence in fascicles of several basidiocarps. Basidio-
carps combining all these features are quite characteristic and illustrated by e.g. Cetto
(1979), Enderle et al. (1985), Furrer-Ziogas (1990), Ludwig (2000, pl. 14, fig. 5.5A).
However, the darker veins on the pileus are lacking in many collections with olivaceous
colours, as illustrated by Breitenbach & Kriinzlin (1995) and Ludwig (2000, pl. 14, fig.
5.5B). On the other hand, large basidiocarps of B. titubans var. titubans may have a
bright yellow pileus with conspicuous concolorous, radial veins, occasionally even with
darker brown veins. Such collections have been depicted by Dühncke (1993: 586, as
B. vitellinus) and by Courtecuisse & Duhem (1994: pl. 1309, as B. variicolor).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both var. olivaceus and var. titubans may occur fasciculate on large, homogeneous
substrates, such as soil mixed with dung and on wood chips. On excrements B. titubans
var. olivaceus grows solitary, like var. titubans.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopic characters of var. olivaceus are identical with var. titubans. The
average spore sizes of the collections studied are indicated in Fig. 1. A collection made
by Huijsman in 1938 near Domburg with macroscopical characters of var. olivaceus
differs in very large spores: (13.0—)14.0—17.5 x 8.0—10.0 x 7.5—9.0 µm, av. 14.9 x 9.1
x 8.2 µm. It may represent in fact a different taxon. Unfortunately the exsiccatum is in
bad condition, heavily damaged by moulds.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Krieglsteiner (1991) reduced B. variicolor to a variety of B. vitellinus. His sugges-
tion was accepted by e.g. Breitenbach & Kriinzlin (1995) and Ludwig (2000). In view
of the described variation I follow this proposal. In fact the only remaining difference
with B. titubans var. titubans is the duller pileus colour with olivaceous tones in the
former taxon. Such a taxon was described before by Gillet (Rea, 1922) with the short#Misc-exposition*]

herbarium material could be traced but there is little doubt that this variety is identical
with B. variicolor. The epithet olivaceus has priority in the rank of variety, as Watling
(1982) suggested before.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boibitius lacteus is a little-known species and subject of both taxonomic and nomen-
clatural confusion. After its introduction by Lange (1940) it was not redescribed until
Watling & Knudsen (1981) and Watling (1983), based on a single collection from
Denmark. Watling claimed that his material agrees with the original diagnosis in
every way, but in fact it differs considerably in spore size (Watling 8.5-10.0(-11.0) x
5.0-6.0(-6.5) µm; Lange 10.5-11.5 x 6.0—6.3 µm). Moreover the collection was not
made in grassland, as Lange did, but in a shady place under Sambucus nigra. In my
opinion B. lacteus sensu Watling is identical with B. reticulatus var. pluteoides. Several
Dutch collections, labelled as Bolbitius lacteus, appeared also to belong to B. reticulatus
var. pluteoides. The two taxa can be easily separated by differences in spore size and
colour and thickness of the spore wall, and usually also by habitat. B. reticulatus var.
pluteoides occurs in forests, usually on decayed wood but sometimes on soil, whereas
B. lacteus grows on dead grass remains or soil in meadows and roadside verges.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In nomenclatural respect Bolbitius lacteus has been confused with Conocybe apala
(Fr.: Fr.) Arnolds, until recently better known as C. lactea J.E. Lange. C. apala is placed
by some authors in the genus Bolbitius, for instance by Bon in (1992). The plate of
B. lacteus in Bon (1987) erroneously represents Conocybe apala, readily recognized
by the elongated, campanulate pileus and microscopically by the lecythiform cheilo-
cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

7.5-8.75 µm. A full description of B. coprophilus will be published in Flora agaricina
neerlandica (Arnolds, 2003).#Description*]

[@Bolbitius coprophilus has been described and illustrated in recent years from various
European countries, e.g. by Daams (1967) from the Netherlands, Watling (1982) from
Great-Britain, Hübsch (1985) and Gerhardt (1997) from Germany, Rald & Strandberg
(1991) from Denmark and Hausknecht & Zuccherelli (1993) from Italy. In the Nether-
lands it has only been observed in glasshouses so far, where it may occur in large quanti-
ties in places (Daams, 1967). In Germany, Denmark and Italy it was recorded from
gardens and other places in open air. According to Gerhardt (1997: 318) it is common
in Berlin. Bolbitius coprophilus has been probably introduced in Europe, possibly from
North-America from which it was originally described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bolbitius incarnatus Hongo was originally described from Japan. In Europe it has
been recorded from Italy (Moser & Cetto, 1987; Cetto, 1989). It was also described
and illustrated under the incorrect name B. demangei by Narducci & Petrucci (1994)
(see description of B. demangei above). B. incarnatus is said to be different from
B. coprophilus in the considerably darker, flesh-coloured pileus, but it may be identical
with the latter species. More research is required.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basionym: Bolbitius pluteoides M.M. Moser, Fung. rar. Ic. col. 7 (1978) 27.#Nomenclature*]

[@Bolbitius reticulatus is easily recognized in the field by the delicate basidiocarps
with a viscid, greyish, violaceous or brownish pileus, free, orange-brown lamellae and
habitat on woody substrates, ranging from small twigs and wood chips to decaying
trunks. Moreover, the spores are considerably smaller and paler than in the other Euro-
pean species of Bolbitius (Fig. 1). However, size, colour and structure of pileus surface
are exceedingly variable and have lead in the past to the distinction of several species
or intraspecific taxa. Already Fries (1821) described B. reticulatus and B. aleuriatus
as different species. Moser (1983) and Courtecuisse & Duhem (1994) distinguished
3 species, B. reticulatus, B. aleuriatus and B. pluteoides. Watling (1982) and Bon
(1992) recognized two species, B. pluteoides and B. reticulatus, the latter including
B. aleuriatus. Bon (1992) distinguished B. aleuriatus in the rank of variety. On the other
hand, Enderle et al. (1985) argued that the characters of these taxa are intergrading and
they recognise only one species, B. reticulatus. Also Ryman & Holmásen (1984) and
Ludwig (2000) considered all variants as belonging to one taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Of this complex 20 collections were studied, mainly from the Netherlands. On the
basis of macromorphology three groups could be distinguished. Part of the collections
had very small and pale basidiocarps in agreement with the description of B. pluteoides
by Moser (1978). According to this author, Watling (1982) and Bon (1992) B. pluteoides
differs from B. reticulatus not only in small and pale basidiocarps, but also in smaller
spore size. However, this character could not be confirmed (Fig. 4). Since size and
colour of the basidiocarps appears to be the only difference, B. pluteoides is reduced
to a variety of B. reticulatus. Occasionally basidiocarps are found that are more or less
intermediate between var. reticulatus and var. pluteoides, for instance combining a pileus
over 20 mm wide with pale pinkish colours (see e.g. Ludwig. 2000, plate 13, fig. 5.3B).
However, the large majority of the collections studied could be easily assigned to one
of the varieties.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several collections in Dutch herbaria, identified as B. lacteus, appeared to belong to
B. reticulatus var. pluteoides. See also notes on B. lacteus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Amolds: Notulae F.A.N. XXXIX — Bolbitius 211#Misc-exposition*]

[@The remaining collections of the B. reticulatus complex had larger basidiocarps with
a more intense violaceous, greyish or brownish pileus. They could be separated in two
groups, viz. a group with a smooth pileus, 12—30 mm broad, and a group with a wrinkled
to reticulate pileus, 25—45 mm broad. However, these groups are intergrading to some
extent and may be only phenotypic variants of a single taxon. For the time being they
are distinguished in the rank of forma, as suggested also recently by Enderle (1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bolbitius ferrugineus is unique among the European representatives of Bolbitius in
the orange-brown colour of the pileus. The spore size is much smaller than in B. titubans
and related species (see Fig. 1) and falls into the range of B. reticulatus (Fig. 4). Also
the pale colour and thin wall of the spores may indicate affinity to the latter species.
However, B. reticulatus differs macroscopically markedly in the pinkish to violaceous
brown or grey pileus and white stipe that is not striate lengthwise. Besides, that species
is usually found on woody substrates, not on soil.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Amolds: Notulae F.A.N. XXXIX — Bolbitius 213#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the pileipellis in B. ferrugineus resembles that of B. titubans and
allies since it is made up of only clavate and pyriform elements. However, in B. titubans
these elements are much larger, measuring 26-84 x 8.0-26 zum (Arnolds, 2003). Their
size is in better agreement with B. reticularus (14-40 x 10-30 µm; Arnolds, 2003), but
in that species the clavate elements are intermixed with branched, trichodermal hyphae
with short, subcylindrical elements. Such hyphae are lacking in B. ferrugineus. The
numerous clamp-connections may also be distinctive for B. ferrugineus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES ON SOME TYPE MATERIALS OF DISCISEDA
(LYCOPERDACEAE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@G. MORENO!, A. ALTÉS! & C. OCHOA?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type collections of four species of Disciseda have been carefully re-examined. This
has lead us to propose the synonyms Disciseda pedicellata = D. hyalothrix and
D. arida 2 D. verrucosa. Our findings are supported by photographs of the macro-
scopic characters and spore ornamentation with scanning electron microscope of
the collections studied.#Abstract*]

[@Disciseda Czern. 1845 is a widely distributed genus of the family Lycoperdaceae (Gas-
teromycetes) and comprises 15 species (Kirk et al., 2001) originating from different
continents. The genus was created with the type species Disciseda collabescens Czern.
1845, in addition to D. compacta Czern. 1845, and subsequently included species of
the genus Catastoma Morgan (Morgan, 1892), a later synonym.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The principal character which distinguishes Disciseda from similar genera (i.e.
Abstoma G. Cunn. 1926, Bovista Pers. 1794 : Pers.) is the particular mode of develop-
ment of the basidiomes (Morgan, 1892; Lloyd, 1903; Smith, 1951; Mitchel et al., 1975).
According to these authors the stoma in this genus typically develops in the basal zone
of the peridium. When the basidiomes reach maturity, their exoperidia fissure in a way
more or less irregularly circumscissile, leaving the lower half in the substrate with the
remainder forming a kind of cap enclosing the upper part of the endoperidium. The
weight of the substrate, which usually remains agglutinated in the said upper cap, facili-
tates the overturning of the liberated basidiomes, thus exposing the stoma in the ‘apical
zone’ to achieve an effective spore dispersal. The difficulty of verifying these details in
situ, has, however, caused some authors to doubt this character or, indeed, to attribute it
only to certain species of Disciseda (Coker & Couch, 1928; Cunningham, 1942).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although species of Disciseda have been included in numerous works, hardly any
have been revised or comparisons have been made between the described taxa. This
therefore implies that a number of taxonomic problems still have to be resolved in this
genus. In this contribution the type collections of four species of Disciseda originating
from Australia, New Zealand (Australasia), Europe and North America are revised.
The object has been to study and to redefine their differential macro- and microscopical
characters in order to ascertain whether they can be maintained as independent species.
In this sense, although it is not a problem exclusive to Disciseda, we must emphasize
the sparsity of characters which can be used in the taxonomy of this genus. These are#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The revision of the type collections of these four species of Disciseda allow us to
reach some conclusions which correct and simplify their taxonomic situation. The first
two, D. hyalothrix and D. pedicellata, are well differentiated from the remainder by their
spores having characteristic long pedicels, normally 10 µm or more in length. Cunning-
ham (1942) mentioned this character in his study of the Gasteromycetes of Australia and
New Zealand, establishing the difference between both species in some minor details.
The most important difference is, without doubt, the spore sizes: 8-10 j/m in diameter
in D. pedicellata and 10—13 µm in D. hyalothrix. Taking into account the scarcity of
available morphological characters to distinguish the different taxa of Disciseda more
clearly, we might justify the separation of the two species by their different spore sizes.
However, the spores we observed in the type of D. Ayalothrix are smaller (8-9 µm in
diameter, including the ornamentation) than given by Cunningham (1942). It is true that
there is a certain difference in the length of the spore pedicels between the two species,
being normally somewhat longer in D. pedicellata. But this difference of length is not
so clear as Cunningham indicated, in no case exceeding 15 µm in length. The length of
the pedicels is a variable character in these species of Disciseda, probably dependent on
the degree of ripening of the gleba and the conditions under which it was observed. In
relation to this, Coker & Couch (1928) gave a measurement for the spore pedicels in the
type collection of D. pedicellata of up to 6 µm long, markedly lower than described here,
while Bottomley (1948) mentioned pedicels up to 37.4 µm long in South African mate-
rial. In this way, the principal differential features between the two species disappear.
The variation which, according to Cunningham (1942), exists in the other characters,
does not appear important to us but is probably the result of ripening and preservation
of the material. For example, Cunningham considers the type of stoma found in each
species to be different: a plane and poorly defined aperture in D. pedicellata, and a
tendency towards a laciniated-denticulated stoma in D. hyalorhrix. In our experience
in the study of Disciseda, the stomata, in the process of Mpening of the basidiomes,
have a tendency to tear into small lacinia or teeth (sometimes a simple mechanical tear).
This does not therefore appear to be a good taxonomic character for distinguishing the
two species. Examination of the morphology of the spore ornamentation (Figs. 4, 5, 8,#Misc-exposition*]
[@nm#Misc-exposition*]

[@nN#Misc-exposition*]

[@PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@9), which is the most important character to take into account in the taxonomy of this
genus, shows no considerable differences, though the ornamentation is slightly more
developed in D. pedicellata. For these reasons, we consider no justification in maintain-
ing of these two independent taxa, and thus propose the synonymy of D. pedicellata and
D. hyalothrix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Disciseda pedicellata has been reported in North America, Africa, Australia (Bot-
tomley, 1948; Moravec, 1958) and Europe (Rydberg, 1949) though the European report
is somewhat doubtful according to the illustration of its spores and the short description
of the specimen given by Rydberg, as already mentioned by Eckblad (1955). Known
only from Australian records (Cunningham, 1942), D. hyalothrix appears to have a
rather restricted distribution.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With respect to the other two species, D. verrucosa and D. arida are characterized
by having large spores, up to 10 m in diameter, sparsely pedicellate and ornamented
with digitiform elements up to 2 µm long. This last feature distinguishes them from
other species of Disciseda. Until now, the records of D. arida are scarce and exclusively
from former Czechoslovakia (Moravec, 1958). Despite the foregoing, Moravec believed
the previously mentioned Swedish record of D. pedicellata to be D. arida. Only SEM
examination of its spores can confirm this. The Spanish collections studied, which
perfectly fit the description of D. arida, significantly extend its area of distribution in
Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Though also little known, Disciseda verrucosa actually has a larger distribution,
having been reported in New Zealand, Australia (Cunningham, 1942), South Africa
(Bottomley, 1948) and Mexico (Aparicio-Navarro et al., 1994; Pérez-Silva et al.,
2000). Comparative study of the type collections of these two taxa, and also of mate-
rial originating from Mexico and Spain, has allowed us to conclude that in neither case
exist sufficiently important morphological differences to justify their maintenance as
independent species. Certainly, the digitiform elements ornamenting the spores of the
type of D. verrucosa are somewhat more developed. However, more important is that
the morphology of this ornamentation is very similar in both species, and we consider
this to reflect variation within a single taxon. In the remaining material studied, it is also
possible to observe these small differences in the degree of development of the spore
ornamentation, which reinforces our opinion. Consequently, it appears to us appropriate
to synonymize D. verrucosa and D. arida.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is entirely dedicated to the functional role of fungi in all kind of ecosystems.
and it attempts to show how the world would function if fungi were not there. It is
conceived as an introduction to the subject for students in mycology and ecology. The
introductory chapters deal with fundamental themes, and define fungi, ecosystems and
their interaction. The two following chapters deal with fungi and primary production,
elucidating the way fungi make available nutrients, and the roles symbiotic and para-
sitic relations play with regards to plant growth and carbon fixation. Chapter 4 gives
an overview of secondary productivity: fungi as food for secondary producers, and
fungal-faunal interactions such as ant and termite fungus gardens, bark beetle fungus
interactions, and the role of fungi as faunal pathogens. Chapter 5 has population and
community regulation by fungi as central theme, dealing with the role of mycorrhiza
with regard to plant successions and plant fitness, saprotroph-pathogen interactions,
the role of endophytes and nematophagous fungi. Chapter 6 has the interaction of fungi
with humans as subject, focussing on fungi and the environment: their interaction with
acidifying pollutants, heavy metals, radionucleotids, and their reaction on climatic
changes. The final chapters are a synopsis and outlook to the future, in which sugges-
tions are made for further research in the subject, using new methodology and tools.
In conclusion, the book offers a lot of information on the subject, and will serve as a
great source of information on fungi in ecosystems. The large number of references
may facilitate further reading.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe apala is one of the most widespread and casily recognised species of Coro-
cybe in Europe, readily characterised by the whitish, non-striate pileus, pubescent white
stipe, very thin and crowded, easily collapsing lamellae and very soft, quickly decaying
context. This fungus is at present generally known under the name Conocybe lactea
(J.E. Lange) Métrod, based on Galera lactea J. E. Lange (1940). It would be surprising
in fact if no earlier name was available for such a striking agaric. Indeed, Hausknecht
(1998: 102) found out that Bolbirius albipes G.H. Otth is an earlier synonym, published
in 1871. He made the combination Conocybe albipes (G.H. Otth) Hauskn.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One may wonder whether Elias Fries knew this fungus as well, since it occurs in the
temperate and hemiboreal zone of Sweden (Watling, 1992: 274). Indeed, when reading
the original description of Agaricus apalus by Fries (1818: 142), it very much resembles
the descriptions of C. lactea and C. albipes. The epithet apalus itself, meaning ‘soft’,
is already indicative in view of the remarkably soft consistence of basidiocarps of this#Misc-exposition*]
[@226 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@fungus. The pileus was described as campanulate, not expanding, obtuse and whitish.
sometimes yellowish at centre; the lamellae as narrowly adnate to almost free, whitish
at first then orange-ochre; the stipe as 75-150 x 4 mm, slender, slightly thickened at
base, fragile, white and entirely pubescent when young; the context as thin and white:
the spore-print as ochraceus. Also the habitat and periodicity, mentioned by Fries, are
in good agreement with C. lactea: in ruderal, grassy place in Femsjó, July - September.
Fries (1818) added that Agaricus apalus is probably related to Agaricus vitellinus
(2 Bolbitius vitellinus). Also, at present Conocybe lactea is sometimes considered to
belong to the genus Bolbitius, e.g. by Bon (1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sanctioning description of Agaricus apalus by Fries in Systema (1821) is largely
identical but more concise. The pileus is then described as submembranaceous, 25 mm
high and wide, the lamellae as rusty brown when mature. Obviously, Fries described
the same fungus as in his Observationes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One may wonder why the epithet apalus has not been accepted earlier for Cono-
cybe lactea. Kühner (1935: 121) used in his fundamental study on Conocybe the name
C. lateritia (Fr.: Fr.) Kühner for this fungus with the addition "sensu Ricken". Appar-
ently Kühner was not sure whether his interpretation was identical with the original
description of Agaricus lateritius by Fries (1821: 265). Indeed, Fries' diagnosis differs
from C. lactea in at least three significant characters: the pileus is described as rusty
brown, becoming paler (“ferrugineo-expallente”), the stipe as glabrous and the habitat
as dung in forest. It is impossible to identify this fungus with any certainty as one of the
other modern species of Conocybe. The interpretation of Agaricus lateritius by Ricken
(1912) and Kühner (1935) as identical with Conocybe lactea can be better understood
in connection with the plate of Agaricus lateritius in Fries" Icones (pl. 127, fig. 2, 1884).
The third depicted basidiocarp represents a fungus with the characteristic elongated-
campanulate, white pileus of C. /actea. It is quite remarkable, however, that the next
basidiocarp is a fungus with similar shape of the pileus but with a dark orange-brown
colour that never occurs in C. lactea. The pileus of Agaricus lateritius is, in agreement
with the name, described as "plus minus obscure lateritius" (lateritius 2 brick-red),
not as white. Consequently, Fries’ plate represents either a heterogeneous collection,
or it represents a strongly hygrophanous species that cannot be identified as one of the
species, distinguished at present in Conocybe. In addition, it should be noticed that
A. lateritius Fr.: Fr. is an illegal homonym of Agaricus lateritius Schaeff.: Fr. (= Hypho-
loma or Psilocybe (sub)lateritia).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kiihner (1935: 123) discussed the name Agaricus apalus in his observations on Cono-
cybe lateritia and implicitly regarded it as a synonym (*... ces distinctions nous parais-
sent de bien faible valeur ..."), consequently also as identical with C. lactea. Watling
& Gregory (1981: 164) in their nomenclatural survey of Bolbitiaceae listed Agaricus
apalus under the rejected names: "Although obviously distinct with its pubescent stipe
this species is unknown; the recently described Conocybe inocybeoides Watling closely
resembles figures in Icones Select. Hymenomycetum II: 127 (1884)". The plate, quoted
by Watling & Gregory, is in fact difficult to interpret. The sporocarp to the left, showing
à robust basidiocarp with a convex, non-striate, white pileus and a white, pubescent
stipe, might represent Conocybe lactea sensu lato indeed. However, the basidiocarp
depicted at the centre with a rather dark, grey-brown pileus and white, pubescent stipe,
is strongly deviating. The description of the pileus, reading "udus livido-pallescens,#Misc-exposition*]
[@Amolds: Notulae F.A.N. XL — New combinations in Conocybe and Pholiotina 227#Misc-exposition*]

[@siccus omnino albus", indicates a strongly hygrophanous species, quite different from
both C. /actea and the original description of Agaricus apalus. One cannot escape the
conclusion that Fries changed his concept of this species over the years and/or that the
quoted plate is based again on a heterogeneous collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is evident that the plates of both Agaricus apalus and A. lateritius are misleading,
but they are not relevant from a nomenclatural point of view. Only the original descrip-
tions are decisive for interpretation of these names. Since the diagnosis of Agaricus
apalus by Fries (1818) fits in well with Conocybe albipes and C. lactea s.l. I propose
to replace these names by the older and sanctioned name Conocybe apala (Fr.: Fr.)
Arnolds.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe apala is a variable species concerning the shape of the pileus. In the
Netherlands two types can be distinguished. The pileus in the most widespread form
has a characteristic, elongated conical or campanulate shape that is always higher than
broad and hardly expanding in age. This form corresponds with C. albipes and C. lactea.
However, other populations are characterised by a hemispherical to convex, expanding
pileus, being broader than high. This form was described by Watling (1983: 262) as
a separate species, Conocybe huijsmanii. On the other hand, Hausknecht (1998: 102)
synonymised C. huijsmanii with C. albipes, although he indicated that he never came
across collections with both types of pileus intermixed. Also in the Netherlands the pop-
ulations with elongated and convex pileus are always clearly separated. Since no other
differences could be found, I prefer to distinguish these taxa in the rank of varieties.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The question remains to which variety the original Agaricus apalus Fr. belongs.
Fries (1818) described the pileus as equally high as broad. This is in better agreement
with the variety with the convex pileus (= C. huijsmanii). Interestingly, the latter variety
seems to be more common in southern Scandinavia than the variety with elongated
pileus (= C. /actea) (Hausknecht in letter). Also Watling (1992: 274) wrote in Nordic
Macromycetes: “Many of these records [of Conocybe lactea] undoubtedly refer to
C. huijsmanii Watling ...". Consequently, C. Auijsmanii is considered to be identical
with C. apala var. apala and C. lactea with C. apala var. albipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both Conocybe subalpina and C. subpallida belong to section Conocybe with pre-
dominantly lecythiform caulocystidia. Within this section these taxa are characterised by
the remarkably pale yellow-brown, thin-walled, fairly large spores (on average 9.6-11.4
x 5.4—6.0 µm), cheilocystidia with small capitulum (less than 5.0 µm) and the formation
of needle-like crystals in ammonia. Conocybe tenera (Schaeff.: Fr.) Fayod is closely
related but has much darker, thick-walled spores. Conocybe subalpina has also been
described as C. macrocephala var. macrospora Hauskn. (Hausknecht, 2000: 92) but
C. macrocephala differs rather strongly in smaller spores and in cheilocystidia and
caulocystidia with larger capitulum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Later on Hausknecht (2002: 69) described Conocybe subalpina and C. subpallida
as separate species, differing in the considerably darker pileus colour in C. subalpina
and in the covering of the stipe, made up of (almost) exclusively lecythiform cystidia
in C. subalpina, whereas in C. subpallida the lecythiform cystidia are intermixed with
cylindrical hairs. However, in material from the Netherlands the two characters are
intergrading to some extent. Some collections combine a dark brown pileus with the
occurrence of hairs at the stipe and the proportion of hair-like caulocystidia is quite
variable from one collection to the other. Therefore, C. subalpina is reduced to a variety
of C. subpallida.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe siliginea (Fr.: Fr.) Kiihner forma rickenii Arnolds, comb. nov.#Nomenclature*]
[@Basionym: Galera rickenii Schaeff., Z. Pilzk. 6 (1930) 171.#Nomenclature*]

[@Conocybe siliginea s.l. is well-characterised by the combination of the pale, pu-
bescent, non-striate pileus, pubescent stipe without or with few lecythiform cystidia,
2-spored basidia and large spores, measuring (10.5-)12.0-19.0(-22.5) x 7.0-10.5
µm. It is a variable species concerning size and general appearance of basidiocarps.
The pileus size ranges from 5—30(—40) mm, the stipe from 15-80(-100) x 1-4 mm.
In view of this variation, many authors distinguish two species, viz. C. siliginea with
small basidiocarps and C. rickenii with larger basidiocarps (e. g. Watling, 1982; Moser,
1983; Hausknecht & Passauer, 1997). Large basidiocarps are usually found immediately
on dung or compost whereas small basidiocarps mainly grow on fertile soil in fields,
gardens and ruderal sites. A similar morphological variation is often found in dung-
inhabiting species. Enderle & Hübner (1999: 9) suggested therefore that C. rickenii is
probably only a luxuriant form of C. siliginea due to a richer substrate and recognised
only one taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, there seem to be some other subtle differences between the two taxa. In
larger basidiocarps the pileus surface often has a shiny, somewhat greasy appearance#Misc-exposition*]
[@Arnolds: Notulae F.A.N. XL — New combinations in Conocybe and Pholiotina 229#Misc-exposition*]

[@and the colour of the pileus tends to be slightly darker, often with an olivaceous tone.
In Dutch collections the characters of the two taxa are more or less intergrading. The
microscopic characters are identical. Therefore the taxa are distinguished at the rank
of forma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nomenclature of C. siliginea has been much disputed. Enderle & Hübner (1999:
9) stated correctly that the identity of Agaricus siligineus Fr. cannot be established
with any certainty on the basis of the authentic descriptions by Fries (1818, 1821) and
therefore they preferred the use of the name Conocybe rickenii (Schaeff.) Kühner. On
the other hand, there are no obvious discrepancies between Fries’ diagnosis and the
current use of the name Agaricus siligineus. Recent interpretations of this name are
consistent and always concern the taxon described above. In addition, a neotype has
been designated by Hausknecht & Passauer (1997: 36) in agreement with current inter-
pretations. Therefore the name Conocybe siliginea is maintained for this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@This species is characterised by the combination of a yellow fruit-body, small cheilo-
cystidia with finger-like outgrowths and cuboid crystals.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the hitherto known European species with cystidia of such shape and size
are C. carpaticus and C. roseoornatus. While the latter is a reddish-coloured species.
C. carpaticus with cream-buff fruit-bodies may also display yellowish tints. However,
its cheilocystidia lack crystals. In addition the SEM pictures show a slightly different
type of spore ornamentation: isolated hemispherical warts in the new species (Fig. 3
a-—c), irregular, confluent warts at times decorated with small outgrowths in C. carpati-
cus (Senn-Irlet, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the North American mycoflora (Hesler & Smith, 1965) Crepidotus contortus Hesler
& A.H. Sm. seems to come close with pale olive buff colours, globose spores and small,
exceptionally strongly contorted cheilocystidia. The cystidia in our species cannot be
described as contorted, they form a dense band not easy to detach for a microscopic
analysis as the outgrowths sometimes intermingle. In addition the presence of crystals
is not reported for C. contortus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crystal bearing cheilocystidia are known from several species in the Crepidotus epi-
sphaeria-complex from the Southern hemisphere (Reid, 1975; Horak, 1977). However,
none of these species have the same shape of cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus citrinus Petch, a species with a mainly (sub-)tropical distribution, has
larger, intensely coloured golden-brown spores and two-spored basidia (Singer, 1973).
There is a difficulty in the unequivocal interpretation of this species, as hitherto pub-
lished type studies do not mention the shape of the cheilocystidia (Pilát, 1951) nor the
crystals and the thick-walled hyphae of at least parts of the pileipellis (Pegler, 1986).
These structures seem to be destroyed in the type collection. Singer (1973) illustrates
quite bizarre cheilocystidia shapes from a collection from Argentina which have the same
antler-like pattern as our species. Own observations on several collections from all over
the world with distinct yellow fruit-bodies have convinced us that C. citrinus should
be interpreted as a species with antler-like cheilocystidia, scattered crystals at least in
the cheilocystidia and often in addition in the pileipellis, and thick-walled epicuticular
hyphae especially near the point of attachment.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In contrast to the original description of C. citrinus, Japanese authors offer a more
exhaustive description of another similar species, C. sulphurinus Imazeki & Toki.
Already the original description mentions rare incrustations of the cheilocystidia. The
study of Japanese collections of C. sulphurinus showed utriform cheilocystidia with
scattered small crystals and the presence of thick-walled hyphae in the epicutis. Yet, the
basidia are all two-spored, the spores larger (see Table I) and in one collection coarse
yellow agglutinated crystals were present in the trama. In contrast to Singer (1973) who
interpreted C. sulphurinus as a synonym of C. citrinus we treat these two as distinct
species, with the main difference found in the shape of the cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@EEF ARNOLDS! & ANTON HAUSKNECHT?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Four interesting species of Conocybe and one species of Pholiotina, recently recorded
from western Europe, are described and illustrated. Conocybe merdaria, related to
C. pubescens, is described as a new coprophytic species with the type locality in
Westfalen, Germany. Another coprophytic species, C. magnispora, was found in the
Netherlands and had not been reported from Europe before. The collections of C.
farinacea in the Netherlands represent the first records of this species in continental
Europe. It is demonstrated that the European records under the name C. fragilis.
originally described from North America, in fact belong to a different species, viz.
Galera incarnata. The new combination Conocybe incarnata is made. The species,
known in Europe under the name of Conocybe plicatella or Galerella plicatella,
appears to be different from the original description of Agaricus plicatellus from
North America and to belong to the genus Pholiotina. The new name Pholiotina
sulcata is introduced.#Abstract*]

[@In volume 6 of Flora agaricina neerlandica the Bolbitiaceae will be treated, including
the genera Conocybe and Pholiotina (Armolds, in prep.). During the revision of fresh
and dried collections of the Netherlands by the first author a number of taxonomic and
nomenclatural problems were encountered that were studied and discussed in close
cooperation with the second author, who is preparing a monographic treatment of
Conocybe and Pholiotina in Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

new species, Conocybe merdaria, and two species that had not been recorded before

[@The Latin diagnosis of C. merdaria is exclusively based on the type collection. The
English description includes also data of other collections of this species, made by the
second author.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe merdaria is close to C. pubescens (Gillet) Kühner in its coprophytic habitat,
macroscopical appearance and stipe covering of lecythiform cystidia and hairs, charac-
teristic of section Mixtae (Watling, 1982; Arnolds, in prep.). It differs from that species
mainly in the predominantly 2-spored basidia. In addition the spores are smaller than in
the 4-spored C. pubescens (in collections from the Netherlands (13.0—)14.0—18.5(-20.0)
x (7.0—)7.5—10.0 µm, on average (14.6—)15.8—17.0 x 8.2—9.2 µm). Therefore we think
that C. merdaria is not merely a 2-spored form of C. pubescens. In that case one would
expect that the spores in 2-spored basidiocarps are larger than in 4-spored basidiocarps.
Moreover, it seems that in the genus Conocybe 2-spored and 4-spored populations usu-
ally belong to different species, as is the case in Coprinus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within sect. Mixtae, Conocybe ambigua Watling is another 2-spored species with
spores in the same size range. However, that species differs from C. merdaria in the
terrestrial habitat and narrower spores (in collections from the Netherlands (10.0—)
10.5-15.5(-16.5) x 5.5-7.5(-8.5) µm, on average 12.5-14.0 x 6.3-7.0 µm) which
are moreover subamygdaliform in side-view. The related C. rubiginosa Watling has
considerably longer spores and also grows on soil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is the first report of Conocybe magnispora in Europe. This species has originally
been described from North America and was later also recorded from South America
(Singer, 1950). It is characterized by the very large spores in combination with 4-spored
basidia and stipe covering exclusively with cylindrical hairs and clavate to lageniform
elements, without lecythiform cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second author investigated the holotype and two other collections from the
southeastern USA and found no essential differences with the European collections.
The spores in the holotype, collected by Murrill, were orange-brown, thick-walled and
measured 15.0—16.5 x 8.5-10.5 µm, on the average 15.6 x 9.6 µm (Fig. 2F). The stipe
was only covered with clavate, lageniform and filiform cystidia (Fig. 2H). In Meyer's
collection the spores were intensely ochre-brown, averaging 15.1 x 8.7 µm, in Singer's
collection they were pale reddish brown and measured on the average 16.0 x 8.8 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe magnispora belongs to section Pilosellae. In that section two other spe-
cies combine very large spores with 4-spored basidia. Conocybe singeriana Hauskn.
grows also on dung, but differs in much larger basidiocarps with the pileus 10-40 mm
and the stipe (45—)60—90(-110) mm with a distinctly bulbous base (Hausknecht &
Krisai-Greilhuber, 1997; Arnolds, in prep.). Conocybe watlingii Hauskn. is another
coprophytic species in this group with very large spores (14.5—18.0 x 7.5-9.5 µm, on
average 16.0—16.7 x 8.5—9.0 m), but it has a rooting stipe base and the stipe covering
is intermixed with some scattered lecythiform cystidia (Hausknecht, 1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe magnispora may also be easily confused with C. pubescens, a much more
common coprophytic species with similar habit and comparable spore size, viz. (13.0—)
14.0-18.5(-20.0) x (7.0-)7.5-10.0 µm, on average (14.6-)15.8-17.0 x 8.2-9.2 µm.
However, the latter species always has a considerable proportion of lecythiform cystidia
among the caulocystidia and therefore belongs to section Mixtae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe farinacea was originally described from three localities in Scotland (Wat-
ling, 1964) and later collected in the New Forest in England (Watling, 1982). Outside
Great Britain it was recorded from Iceland (Watling, 1985), but not from continental
Europe. The species is characterized in the first place by the farinaceous smell and taste,
a unique feature in the genus Conocybe. It should be noticed that in the collection from
the Netherlands this smell was absent or weak in undamaged basidiocarps. It became
much more apparent when basidiocarps were crushed or cut.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopic characters of the quoted collection were compared with those of
the holotype and dried basidiocarps from cultures of the type collection, harvested in
1960 and 1961. All essential characters were similar. The spores in the holotype meas-
ured 13.5-17.0 x 7.0-9.5 µm, on the average 15.6 x 8.2 µm (Fig. 3F); the spores in the
cultured collection from the holotype in L measured (12.0-)13.0-15.0 x 7.5-9.0 µm,
on average 14.1 x 8.3 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the original description of C. farinacea, Watling (1964) stated: “The stipe has
long narrow hairs, 1.5-2.5 µm in diameter, as well as similar cells to those on the gill
edge and/or elliptical, subglobose, non-capitate and slightly capitate cells". Therefore
the species was placed by Watling (1982) in section Mixtae. In the collection from the
Netherlands lecythiform cystidia were absent on the stipe. In the type collection, the
second author found only two slightly capitate caulocystidia (Fig. 3H) and such cells#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conocybe farinacea may be confused at first sight with the common coprophytic
species C. pubescens. The latter species differs not only in the absence of the fari-
naceous smell, but also in the larger spores, measuring (13.0-)14.0-18.5(-20.0) x
(7.9-)7.5-10.0 m, on average 15.8—17.0 x 8.3—9.2 µm, and the frequent occurrence of
lecythiform caulocystidia. Watling (1964) demonstrated that cultures of C. farinacea are
incompatible with cultures of C. pubescens, as well with two non-coprophytic species
of section Mixtae, viz. C. pseudopilosella Kiihner & Watling (= C. pulchella (Velen.)

[@Conocybe incarnata is à striking and beautiful species with its pink to vinaceous
pileus. Another important diagnostic character is the clearly rooting base of the stipe.
Schaffer (1930) supposed that his Galera incarnata could be identical with Galera
fragilis Peck, described from North America. This hypothesis was accepted by Kiihner
(1935), who therefore named the European collections Conocybe fragilis (Peck) Singer.
That name was also adopted by Watling & Gregory (1981), Watling (1982), Moser
(1983) and other European authors, although nobody compared the European collec-
tions with the type of C. fragilis from North America. The American mycologist Hesler
indicated already in unpublished notes that the stipe in the holotype of Galera fragilis
is covered with numerous lecythiform cystidia, intermixed with few non-lecythiform
cystidia and cylindrical hairs. Recent examination of the type collection [USA, Kansas,
Rooks County, on ground in short grass, E. Bartholomew 2313 (NYS)] by the second
author confirmed this observation (Fig. 5D). In addition, three specimens in this col-
lection had a slightly bulbous stipe base without pseudorhiza.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the well-preserved holotype of Conocybe incarnata, lecythiform caulocystidia
are completely lacking. The stipe covering is a mixture of non-lecythiform elements
and hairs (Fig. 4H). In addition, at least two out of six type specimens show a distinct,
although broken, pseudorhiza (Fig. 4E). This character of great taxonomic significance
was neither mentioned in the original description, nor noticed by other authors. Also
the studied collections from the Netherlands, Austria and Finland show a stipe without
lecythiform cystidia and a pseudorhiza up to 30 mm long. The spores in the type col-
lection of C. incarnata measured 7.0—9.5 x 4.5—6.0 µm, on the average 8.7 x 5.2 µm
(Fig. 4F). The size of the spores in the type of Galera fragilis was almost identical,
measuring 8.5-10.0 x 5.0-6.0 µm, on the average 9.1 x 5.4 µm (Fig. 5A). However,
the spores of C. incarnata have a considerably larger germ pore (1.0—1.5 µm) than the
spores of C. fragilis (0.5—0.8 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is evident that C. fragilis and C. incarnata are distinct species that are probably not
even closely related: In view of the stipe covering the former species belongs to section
Mixtae whereas C. incarnata is a member of section Pilosellae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Latin diagnosis is based on the type collection (also Fig. 6A-C). The English
description is a compilation of data of all collections studied by us.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pholiotina sulcata is a characteristic species with its soon expanding pileus that is
irregularily sulcate-plicate, often also split at the margin in places. In view of the absence
of any veil it belongs to Pholiotina section Piliferae (Kiihner) Singer. The collections
from the Netherlands differ from most earlier descriptions in the presence of exclusively
2-spored or mixed 4-and 2-spored basidia. This variation explains the large range in
spore size in this species (Fig. 6A, E). Also Kühner (1935: 139) described a collection
(as Conocybe plicatella) with partially 2-spored basidia. The exclusively 4-spored and
2-spored collections do not deserve a taxonomic status since many basidiocarps combine
variable proportions of the two types of basidia. It is a notable exception within the
Bolbitiaceae where usually 4- and 2-spored taxa are clearly separated and distinguished
in the rank of species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pholiotina sulcata has been synonymised by European authors with the North Ameri-
can species Agaricus plicatellus Peck in the past. That name was introduced by Peck in
1878 in order to replace the name Agaricus coprinoides Peck (1873), a later homonym
of Agaricus coprinoides Corda 1831, representing a quite different fungus. Agaricus
coprinoides was originally described by Peck (1873) as a small agaric with “membra-
naceous, soon expanded pileus, often split on the margin, plicate-sulcate to the small
even disk, yellowish inclining to ochre ... the appearance of the pileus is suggestive of
some of the smaller Coprini". The aberrant appearance of the basidiocarps was reason
for Earle (1909) to erect the genus Galerella, typified by Agaricus coprinoides Peck.
Singer (1951) accepted this genus in his world wide survey of Agaricales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second author studied the holotype (New York State, Cayuga County, Sterling,
C.H. Peck, NYS) and concluded that the pileus surface in Galerella plicatella, as well as
in other tropical species assigned to Galerella, is in fact completely different from that
of Pholiotina sulcata. In Galerella the pileus margin is minutely and regularily crenulate
and the pileus is deeply and densely sulcate-striate up to the centre, as in Coprinus plica-
tilis and allies (see also Thomas et al., 2001; Horak & Hausknecht, 2002). In Pholiotina
sulcata the pileus margin is irregularily wavy-lobed and sulcate only in places up to a var-
iable proportion of the radius. It does not remind to Coprinus spp. at all. Watling & Gre-
gory (1981) already noticed that the European collections, named Conocybe or Galerella
plicatella, are *doubtfully the same’ as the North American species. Watling studied
also the type collection of Agaricus coprinoides Peck and added a note to the exsic-
catum, reading: "After examining European material attributed to this species I doubt#Misc-exposition*]
[@252 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@whether this fungus has even been seen in Europe”. More extensive research is needed
to evaluate whether Galerella deserves the status of an independent genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pholiotina sulcata and Galerella plicatella differ also in some microscopic charac-
ters. The spores in the latter species are clearly flattened and in part slightly rhomboid
to slightly hexagonal in frontal view, measuring 7.0—8.5 x 5.0—6.0 x 4.5—5.0 µm, on
the average 7.4 x 5.5 x 4.6 µm in the type collection (Fig. 7A). The cheilocystidia are
rather similar. In the type of G. plicatella they are lageniform and measure 20-50 x
7.0-10 µm with a neck 3.0—5.0 µm broad (Fig. 7C).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Anew species of ascomycetes, Phaeotrichosphaeria minor, is described, illustrated
and compared with the closely related species within the genus and a modified key
is given.#Abstract*]

[@A new species of ascomycetes was found amongst collections obtained during the ongo-
ing study of the ascomycetes of Argentina (Romero, 1987, 1998; Romero & Samuels,
1991; Romero & Carmarán, 1997; Romero et al., 1999). This species is identified as a
member of the genus Phaeotrichosphaeria Sivan. Itis still uncertain in which order and
family this genus should be placed. Barr (1990) placed it in Sordariales, Lasiosphaer-
iaceae, although Réblová (1999) arranged it in Trichosphaeriales, Trichosphaeriaceae,
mainly based on characters of the peridial wall, asci, ascospores and conidiogenesis
of the anamorph.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phaeotrichosphaeria was erected to accommodate some unitunicate pyrenomycetes
with Endophragmiella anamorphs (Sivanesan & Sharma, 1983). It contained three
species, Phaeotrichosphaeria indica Sivan. & N. D. Sharma from India, being the type
species, P. hymenochaeticola Sivan. & N.D. Sharma from New Zealand and P. britan-
nica Sivan. & N.D. Sharma from England.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One remarkable feature of this new taxon is the presence of peridial pores. These
pores are apparently similar to Munk pores, which are hitherto known only in Vialac-
aceae and certain groups of the Sordariales, notably Nitschkiaceae and a few species
of the Lasiosphaeriaceae. Cannon (1995) listed fungi with this kind of pore and also
studied their systematic significance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This Argentine fungus is unique on account of a combination of ascus and ascospores
morphology and peridial pores. After the examination of holotypes of the species be-
longing to the genus Phaeotrichosphaeria, we conclude that it is a new species which
is described here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The material considered here is deposited at the BAFC and IMI herbaria. Specimens
from IMI (herbarium abbreviations follow Holmgren et al., 1990) were also studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomic position of this fungus has been difficult to ascertain. In the type
of ascus, especially the structure of the apical ring, it resembles members of the Sor-
dariales. The presence of an ostiole and of peridial pores further suggest the family
Lasiosphaeriaceae (Barr, 1990). Réblová (1999) placed Phaeotrichosphaeria in the
Trichosphaeriaceae but she did neither study the type nor notice the presence of peridial
pores. Nevertheless, our examination of the holotype of Phaeotrichosphaeria indica
Sivan. & N.D. Sharma revealed the presence of these peridial pores and until more
research is done we follow Barr (1990) and place Phaeotrichosphaeria in Lasiosphaeria-
ceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The asci and ascospores of Phaeotrichosphaeria indica and P. minor are both very
similar but P. indica has larger perithecia, asci and ascospores than P. minor, Further-
more, the ascomata of P. indica are completely covered by hyphal hairs and they also
differ in the type of peridial pores. In P. indica these are simple holes, one or two per
cell, which are very easy to overlook. They were not described by Sivanesan & Sharma
(1983). In P. minor the pores are very abundant along the peridial cells (Figs. 5, 6),
conspicuous, one or more per cell and very evident with a dark red rim around the
hole (Fig. 7). According to Sivanesan & Sharma (1983) the anamorph of P. indica is
Endophragmiella spec. We could not affirm that P. minor also has an Endophragmiella
anamorph but some free conidia of the Endophragmiella type are present around the
perithecia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@256 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 2, 2003#Misc-exposition*]

[@Peridial pores are also present in the other two species of Phaeotrichosphaeria, P. bri-
tannica and P. hymenochaeticola. But in longitudinal section of the ascoma they can
be hardly seen and are very scarce, only one or two in very few cells. These pores are
very simple, similar to those of P. indica and even more inconspicuous. It is necessary
to examine additional specimens of all species to confirm the presence of pores in the
genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sivanesan & Sharma (1983) suggested a close relationship between Phaeotrichos-

phaeria (Cannon, 1995) reinforces this suggestion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The peridial pores and the dark, 1-septate ascospores also invite comparison with
Nitschkia phaeospora described from Taiwan (Hsieh et al., 1998). However, the asci
are different: in Nitschkiaceae they are simple without any apical structure, in the new
species Phaeotrichosphaeria minor there is an apical ring. The presence of an ostiole
in P. minor further suggests that it cannot be referred to the Nitschkiaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The 4th volume in this series, which was initiated by German J. Krieglsteiner, is
completed and prepared for print after Krieglsteiner's death by Andreas Gminder.
The present volume treats several families of Agarics, viz. Amanitaceae, Lepiotaceae,
Entolomataceae, Pluteaceae, Bolbitiaceae, Strophariaceae and Crepidotaceae. Within
the families, genera are treated in alphabetical order. Keys are presented to all species
occurring in Baden-Wiirttemberg, followed by short descriptions or notes to the species,
including details on ecology, threat and distribution in the state Baden-Wiirttemberg.
Many species are also presented in the form of colour photographs, which are generally
of good to excellent quality, and distribution maps are often given. The taxonomy used
in this book generally follows the traditional concepts in modern literature, with a few
exceptions. Krieglsteiner had a rather rigid opinion about species concept, which leads
also in this volume to the lumping of closely related or morphologically similar, but not
necessarily related species, treating them as varieties of each other. Examples in this
volume are Macrolepiota procera var. konradii, and Entoloma hirtum var. dysthaloides.
Whether these changes are justified will have to be proved in future. Apart from this
tiny bit of criticism, the book can be highly recommended, and will serve as a valuable
source of information, not only for those who want to name a fungus from Baden-
Württemberg.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this species particularly the shape and the size of the spores are characteristic.
None of the other species with cylindrical veil elements has spores as small as Ulje
926. The central germ pore is the most important difference with other species (except
C. hiascens) which possess cylindrical veil elements. Coprinus hiascens, however, has
spores with a conical apex, lageniform cheilocystidia and tapering pileocystidia, whereas
Uljé 926 has spores with a rounded apex, vesiculose cheilocystidia and pileocystidia,
that are broadened at the apex. Because of the very small size of the fruit-bodies and
the greyish colour of the pileus this species is very inconspicuous and difficult to find.
Another species that agrees somewhat is C. Aeterothrix, but that species have larger
spores with Q — 1.65—1.70 (Uljé 926: 1.35—1.40) and lageniform cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Psychotria asiatica L. (Rubiaceae) is one of the most common native understorey shrubs
in Hong Kong and South China (Davis et al., 2001). It occurs widely in shrubland and its
fruits are small and fleshy, presumably dispersed by birds (Corlett, 1996). Its abundance
and successful colonization in degraded landscapes makes it one of the suitable candi-
dates for studies of fructicolous fungi, due to the potentially conflicting relationship
with frugivorous birds and microbes (Herrera, 1982; Cipollini & Stiles, 1993; Cipollini,
2000). The fruits need to attract dispersers after ripening, but repel microbes. In the
current study, the mycota of different wild fruits species are being investigated. An
ascomycete was found on a decaying fruit of Psychotria asiatica, belonging to the genus
Lophiotrema Ces. & De Not. It is described and illustrated here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Decaying fruits of Psychotria asiatica were collected from Lung Fu Shan, in Hong
Kong. The fruits were returned to the laboratory and incubated at room temperature
(~23°C) in ‘zip lock’ plastic bags with added sterile moist paper at room temperature.
Fruits were examined under the stereo-microscope periodically. Squash mounts and sec-
tions of fungal fruit-bodies were mounted in water for measurement and photographed
with a digital camera. Fungi were isolated and are maintained in the University of Hong
Kong Culture Collection (HKUCC) and fruits with fungi were dried and deposited in
the University of Hong Kong Herbarium (HKU(M)).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Lophiotrema has been treated as a synonym of Lophiostoma by several
authors (Chesters & Bell, 1970; Hawksworth et al., 1983; Eriksson & Hawksworth,
1987). Holm & Holm (1988) separated Lophiotrema from Lophiostoma by the differ-
ences of peridium and ascospore morphology and five species were described. Barr
(1992) accepted this classification, with three additional species. The new fungus
found in the current survey shares characters which are typical of Lophiorrema species.
Lophiotrema psychotrii is characterized by having typically small ascomata (85-140
µm), a peridium composed of textura angularis, up to 15 µm wide, cylindrical asci,
and hyaline ascospores with a mucilaginous sheath. These characteristics differ from
typical Lophiostoma species, where the ascomata are generally larger (200—700 µm).
the peridium comprises several layers of parallel, long, prismatic cells, asci are mostly
clavate and ascospores often have terminal appendages rather than a mucilaginous
sheath (Holm & Holm, 1988; Liew et al., 2002; Hyde et al., 2002).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Presently, there are 8 species of Lophiotrema (Holm & Holm, 1988; Barr, 1992).
Holm & Holm (1988) provided a key to five species, but two of these were not formally
described (named only as Lophiotrema sp. 1 and 2). Therefore a key to the six named
species is provided here. Lophiotrema psychotrii is similar to L. alpinum in spore mor-
phology. However, the former differs in having smaller ascospores (14 —17 x 4—4.5 µm
vs. (15—)18-20 x 4—4.5 µm), asci (64 —80 x 6—7.5 µm vs. 80-100 x 7-11 µm), and a dif-
ferent type of mucilaginous sheath (Barr, 1992). The sheath in L. psychotrii is narrow in
the middle and drawn out to form pad-like appendages at both ends, while ascospores of
L. alpinum are surrounded by a condensed sheath. Lophiotrema neohysterioides should
also be compared with L. psychotrit; they have fusiform spores with a similar size range,#Misc-exposition*]

lipid guttules per cell. The mucilaginous sheath, if present, is narrow and condensed,
and does not form pads as in L. psychotrii (Chesters & Bell, 1970; Barr, 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A NEW AGROCYBE ON WOODCHIPS IN NORTHWESTERN EUROPE#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the scope of a revision of the genus Agrocybe for Flora agaricina neerlandica
volume 6, a new species was discovered from heaps of woodchips in Rotterdam,
the Netherlands. The species, Agrocybe rivulosa, spec. nov. is here described and
is characterized by the strongly radially rugose cap, a large but thin ring and large
spores of 11.5-12.0 x 7.0-8.0 µm on average. It belongs to subgen. Agrocybe sect.
Agrocybe on account of the spores with a conspicuous and wide germ pore and the
clavate to sphaeropedunculate cystidia. The species has been found on several locali-
ties in the (north)west of the Netherlands. Recently, the species has also been found
in the eastern part of the Netherlands and in Luxembourg.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Furthermore, a key is provided to the species on woodchips in the Netherlands and
adjacent countries.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Agrocybe has been revised recently for the project ‘Flora agaricina neerlan-
dica' (Nauta, 1987; in prep. a), resulting in 13 species recorded for the Netherlands.
Remarkably enough, two new species were found among the material from the Nether-
lands already present in L. One of them is described here, the other new species, which
belongs to sect. Pediadeae, is described elsewhere in this volume (Nauta, in prep. b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1999 an unknown Agrocybe was collected from a heating heap of woodchips in
the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands by Gerrit Keizer. Since then, the Agrocybe has
been found on several places in the western part of the Netherlands, always on (heaps
of) woodchips. It is now also known from the eastern part (Dam, 2003), and recently
from Luxembourg (M. T. Tholl, pers. comm.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original collection had a noteworthy radially venose yellow-brown cap, a large
but evanescent ring, and a remarkable striate stipe with a thick ball of mycelium at the
base. Microscopically the new Agrocybe is characterized by large spores, on average
11.5-12 x 7-8 yam, and the clavate to pedicellate globose cystidia. No pileocystidia could
be found. The robust fruit-bodies reminded a bit of Agrocybe putaminum, another species
on woodchips which is now very common in the western part of the country. Because
of an increased use of woodchips on footpaths in woods and parks, several species
growing on woodchips have become more common now. The velvety cap and lack of
ring distinguishes Agrocybe putaminum morphologically from the new species, besides
microscopical differences. On the other hand the morphological resemblance with a
remarkably wrinkled Agrocybe cylindracea is also striking, but again, the microscopy is
rather different. Agrocybe cylindracea var. rugosovenosa Singer (1953) is distinguished
by the wrinkled cap, but also this taxon has a different microscopy. Agrocybe putaminum
and A. cylindracea have smaller and narrower spores with a less conspicuous germ
pore, differently shaped cheilocystidia and pileocystidia are present. Comparison with
other species occurring outside the region covered by the Flora agaricina neerlandica,#Misc-exposition*]

Scandinavia is described by Watling (1988). But also this species differs in sporesize
and shape of cystidia, viz. spores 7.5—9.5 x 5-6 µm and cheilocystidia vesiculose.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is remarkable that this is the second new agaric which is discovered on heating
heaps within a short period of time. In 1997 Agaricus rufotegulis was discovered in
the Netherlands and south England on heating heaps of rotting leaves (Nauta, 1999),
Meanwhile, that species has also been found in Portugal (Hausknecht, 2002), but un-
fortunately it has not been found since in the Netherlands.#Misc-exposition*]

line-drawings. Price: EUR 85 excl. EUR 10 postal charges.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Mycena specialist Robich, known from many publications, created his magnum
opus with the present book, which, according to the title, covers all species known from
Europe. Although many of his observations are based on southern European collections,
his studies extended to other parts of Europe as well, and an attempt has been made to
study the available type collections. His intensive contacts with the late Dr. R. A. Maas
Geesteranus are reflected in the overall infrageneric taxonomy and species concepts. A
comparison with Maas Geesteranus' Conspectus of Northern Hemispheric Mycena is
therefore unavoidable. Robich book has a practical approach, with keys to the sections,
and within sections to the species, both in Italian and English, which greatly improves
the use of the book outside Italy. The descriptions are all in the same format, and include
a nomenclator with the valid name, basionym and synonyms, with literature references,
and the original diagnosis with a translation in Italian. A rather complete iconography
facilitates comparison with literature. The descriptions are elaborate, listing macroscopi-
cal characters and habitat, followed by the microscopic characters. Observations, when
necessary, complete the species description, followed by a list of examined specimens.
As such, Robich book forms a perfect supplement to that of Maas Geesteranus cited
above. For detailed information on nomenclature, types and history the latter publication
has of course more to offer. The great value of the present book, apart from its accurate
and elaborate text, is the iconography. All species are illustrated with line-drawings of
excellent quality, supplemented with at least one coloured photo in situ, and often also
with one or more photographs of microscopical structures. Also for those who do not
master the Italian language, this book is of great use. Students in Mycena are therefore
greatly advised to purchase this very valuable publication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new Coprinus species in subsection Setulosi, Coprinus parvulus is described and
illustrated.#Abstract*]

[@During an inventory of fungi in a coniferous forest in the Netherlands, in the autumn of
2001, a very small species of Coprinus was found on dung. Incubated dung produced
more carpophores, which made it possible to complete the description. On account of
the presence of lageniform to fusiform pileocystidia it belongs in the subsection Setulosi
J. E. Lange of section Pseudocoprinus P. D. Orton & Watling. In addition spherical cells
of veil are present on the pileus. This Coprinus could not be assigned to any species in
literature and is therefore described as new.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The presence of lageniform pileocystidia places C. parvulus in subsection Setulosi.
In that subsection only C. pellucidus P. Karst., another small dung inhabiting Coprinus
species, is rather close to C. parvulus. That species, however, lacks veil consisting of
sphaerocysts on the pileus, has larger spores and globose cheilocystidia. Cacialli et
al. (1999: 234) mention another taxon close to C. pellucidus, having some lageniform
cheilocystidia between the globose ones, but with much larger spores similar to these
in C. pellucidus. Other species of the subsection have considerably larger spores, often
with eccentric germ pores, larger fruit-bodies or a non-coprophilous habitat (Uljé &
Bas, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]
