[@A COMPARISON OF THE APPLICATION
OF A BIOLOGICAL AND PHENETIC SPECIES CONCEPT
IN THE HEBELOMA CRUSTULINIFORME COMPLEX
WITHIN A PHYLOGENETIC FRAMEWORK#Misc-exposition*]

[@DUUR K. AANEN! & THOMAS W. KUYPER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@A method is presented to derive an operational phenetic species concept for the Hebe-
loma crustuliniforme complex in northwestern Europe. The complex was found to
consist of at least 22 biological species (intercompatibility groups; ICGs). Almost
none of these biological species could be recognised unambiguously by morpholog-
ical criteria. It is therefore necessary to base a phenetic species concept on combina-
tions of biological species. However, such species delimitation must be performed
within an explicitly phylogenetic context. It is crucial therefore to have a reliable
estimate of the phylogeny of 22 biological species in that complex. Based on two
nuclear sequences, we present a best estimate of the phylogeny of biological species
within the complex. Using this phylogeny, on the basis of strict monophyly only two
species can be morphologically recognised among 22 biological species. Relaxing the
criterion of monophyly and allowing paraphyletic groupings of biological species as
phenetic species would result in the recognition of three phenetic species. A tree, with
the five ICGs of the previously defined morphospecies H. crustuliniforme (1, 2, 3,
4 and 5) constrained as a monophyletic group, can not be rejected. This constrained
tree, together with the relaxed criterioon that allows for paraphyletic groupings of
biological species, leads to the recognition of four phenetic species, viz. H. crustu-
liniforme, H. helodes, H. incarnatulum and H. velutipes. These phenetic species are
described and a key is provided. Other taxon names are briefly discussed. The very
limited ability to translate a biological species concept into an operational phenetic
species concept is explained by the lack of qualitative characters and the plasticity
of quantitative characters. Recency of common evolutionary history is also a major
factor. Intercompatibility tests and DNA based phylogenies indicate that most bio-
logical species are very closely related and hence provide support for the claim that
correspondence between a biological species concept and a phenetic species concept
in the H. crustuliniforme complex is not likely to be forthcoming. In an Appendix
morphological descriptions are provided of the 22 ICGs.#Abstract*]

[@Among the various genera of the Agaricales the genus Hebeloma (Fr.) Kumm. has often
been regarded as taxonomically difficult. The status of a number of described species
is uncertain, and taxonomic controversies abound. This somewhat frustrating situation
has been eloquently described by Favre (1960): "Il n'est pas de genre oü la taxonomie

[@parler des hébélomes (...), je me trouve dans le plus grand embarras.” Within the genus
the complex of taxa around H. crustuliniforme (Bull.) Quél. has been particularly prob-
lematic. For the purpose of this paper that species complex is operationally described
as follows: Very small to large mushrooms. Pileus viscid, ranging from white to dark
reddish brown, but often with a paler margin. Cortina absent. Lamellae clay-brown,
often exuding drops of water (‘lamellae weeping’). Stipe shorter to (much) longer
than pileus diameter, white fibrillose, with a pruinose to flocculose apex. Spore print
clay-brown. Spores ornamented. Cheilocystidia cylindrical to clavate to (sub)capitate,
thin-walled, but sometimes with thickened wall in the median or upper part, hyaline.
Pleurocystidia absent. Ectomycorrhizal with a very wide range of trees, under a large
range of ecological conditions.#Description*]

[@In the framework of a study on species and speciation in the H. crustuliniforme com-
plex (Aanen & Kuyper, 1999; Aanen et al., 2000a, 2001) the question about an optimal
taxonomy was also addressed. However, an optimal taxonomy can only be defined in
relation to species concepts (Levin, 2000). Discussions on species concepts are as old
as the taxonomic practice. Even a classification of the various kinds of species con-
cepts is liable to heated debate, because the terms for the various concepts have as much
an ideological as an explanatory function. For the purpose of this paper we recognise two
classes of species concepts, viz. the mechanistic and non-mechanistic or historical spe-
cies concepts. Mechanistic species concepts, often taken together under the denominator
biological species concept, are based on the various processes and mechanisms by which
species originate (speciate) or by which they cohere. Mechanisms of speciation relate to
the origin of reproductive isolation related to the origin of genetic divergence (incompat-
ibility first or divergence first; Aanen et al., 2000b), and mechanisms of cohesion refer
to genetic and ecological mechanisms that allow interbreeding within that species and
simultaneously prevent breeding with members of different species. Among the non-
mechanistic species concepts, which consider pattern instead of process, two concepts
have attracted much attention, viz. a phylogenetic concept, which emphasises mono-
phyly of all the members of the species, and a phenetic concept, which emphasises
morphology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Each of the three species concepts has been applied to the H. crustuliniforme complex.
Aanen & Kuyper (1999) studied intercompatibility groups (ICGs) and arrived at the
conclusion that at least 20 different ICGs (‘biological species’) could be recognised.
However, a subsequent analysis of a subset of these isolates showed that intercompat-
ibility was not a qualitative character (‘all or nothing’), but that degrees of compatibility
could be recognised. One isolate turned even out to be fully compatible with members
of 2 ICGs, which were otherwise incompatible (Aanen et al., 2000b). Apparently, inter-
compatibility may be a plesiomorphous character and the mechanistic species concept
does not always allow to determine unambiguously to which species a certain fungus
belongs. The ICGs were subsequently subjected to a phylogenetic analysis, based on
sequence data of the internal transcribed spacers (Aanen et al., 2000a). This phyloge-
netic analysis also showed that ICGs did not always meet the criterion of monophyly.
The phenetic species concept (*morphological species concept’) has been applied by
different authors (e.g. Bruchet, 1970; Vesterholt, 1995) but, as Favre’s words testify,
consensus was hardly reached.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Aanen & Kuyper: Biological and phenetic species concept in Hebeloma crustuliniforme 287#Page-header*]

[@In this paper we attempt to reconcile the various species concepts, or, if the concepts
are fundamentally incompatible, at least to arrive at an operational taxonomy that is
consistent with genetics, morphology and phylogeny. We compare a mechanistic (*bio-
logical’) and phenetic (‘morphological’) species concept within an explicit phylogenetic
framework. Our ultimate aim is the phenetic species concept as this is the only concept
useful for the general user of a Flora (Kuyper, 1988). The criterion for consistency is
intended to put constraints on the phenetic species concept. First, no intercompatible col-
lections should be classified as different species. Second, interincompatible collections
should be regarded as belonging to the same phenetic species, if there are no morpho-
logical criteria by which these biological species can be separated. Third, combina-
tions of biological species as phenetic species should only be accepted if the group of
biological species forms a monophyletic entity. However, even these conditions can
conflict. For example, if one non-basal ICG can be morphologically separated from a
monophyletic group of ICGs, the remainder of that group automatically turns into a
paraphyletic group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The strict criterion of monophyly of species has therefore been challenged. We
recognise that biological species can form paraphyletic groups. De Queiroz & Dono-
ghue (1988, 1990) have stressed that interbreeding units need not necessarily be
monophyletic. As speciation often involves the splitting off of marginal and/or local
populations (Levin, 1993; Rieseberg & Brouillet, 1994), a consequence is that after
such a speciation event the parent species has become paraphyletic. If the rules of the
cladistic game prevent recognition of such paraphyletic groupings as species, we must
accept a new mechanism of speciation, described by Templeton (1998) as speciation by
remote control. Aanen et al. (2001) noted that ICG 17 (H. velutipes) was paraphyletic,
as it contained two ITS types that belonged to different clades. Paraphyly of biological
species has also been observed in the genus Pleurotus (Vilgalys & Sun, 1994). In that
genus biological species were monophyletic within a continent, but paraphyletic when
investigated over various continents. The same pattern likely has occurred in ICG 17.
The ITS polymorphism occurred in Europe and in North America. A plausible scenario
for this polymorphism in the face of concerted evolution is divergence in allopatry,
followed by bilateral migration to both continents. This could have occurred with the
introduction of plantation forest trees, such as Pseudotsuga menziesii in Europe, where
the phenetic species H. velutipes is regularly found (Aanen et al., 2001).#Misc-exposition*]

[@If, however, one accepts paraphyletic taxa at the level of biological species, one may
wonder why combinations of biological species, forming phenetic species, could not also
form paraphyletic entities. We therefore also considered the consequences of relaxing
the criterion of strict monophyly and decided to recognise paraphyletic phenetic species
as well. Alternatively, we could accept such paraphyletic taxa on infraspecific level.
However, we considered polyphyletic entities unacceptable as phenetic species. To test
for monophyly of groups of ICGs, which have formerly been recognised as morphospe-
cies, the most parsimonious tree(s) were compared with constrained trees in which such
morphospecies (H. crustuliniforme, H. lutense, H. pusillum) were monophyletic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A crucial step in our approach is to have a reliable estimate of the phylogeny of the
biological species. For the H. crustuliniforme complex as a whole, we have estimated
phylogenetic relationships based on ITS sequences (Aanen et al., 2000a). Taxonomic#Misc-exposition*]
[@288 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@resolution based on ITS sequences turned out to be insufficient for a group of nine ICGs
belonging to different morphospecies such as H. crustuliniforme, H. leucosarx and
H. pusillum). For that group the Intergenic Spacer (IGS) was also studied (Aanen et
al., 2000b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Different data sets that have the same evolutionary history are expected to converge
onto the true species phylogeny of the group under study, if analysed using appropriate
phylogenetic methods (Mes, 1995). In principle, such data sets can be combined. Kluge
(1989) proposed that phylogenetic analysis should always be performed using all the
available evidence (the 'total evidence' approach). In this approach, all of the independ-
ent characters available to the systematist should be combined and then analysed using
parsimony. However, others have argued against this approach (e. g. Lutzoni & Vilgalys,
1995). Miyamoto & Fitch (1995) argued that phylogenetic trees should be estimated
separately from each data set and the different estimates should be compared using
taxonomic congruence. Under this separate analysis approach, cach partition represents
an independent estimate of the tree, and these different estimates can be judged for
congruence. It is often argued that congruence among different data partitions provides
some of the strongest evidence that a particular phylogenetic estimate is accurate (Hillis
et al., 1996). A compromise between the 'total evidence' approach and the 'separate
analysis’ approach is the ‘conditional combination’ approach (Huelsenbeck et al., 1996a)
as advocated by Bull et al. (1993) and De Queiroz (1993). Under this approach, data sets
are statistically tested for homogeneity. Heterogeneous data sets are those that result in
significantly different estimates of phylogeny when analysed separately and these data
sets can not be combined. If the test result is non-significant, i.e. the data sets do not
result in significantly different estimates of the phylogeny, then these data sets should
be combined (Huelsenbeck et al., 1996a). As an alternative to combining the data sets,
the resulting trees can be combined (Mes, 1995; Sanderson et al., 1998). A 'supertree"
is an estimate of a phylogeny assembled from sets of smaller estimates (source trees)
sharing at least some taxa (Sanderson et al., 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@To the morphological characters studied belong those traditionally used in Hebeloma
taxonomy (Bruchet, 1970; Vesterholt, 1995). Since many of the characters used are
quantitative, we did not reconstruct phylogenies based on these characters. Instead,
we i) reconstructed organismal phylogenies based on molecular data; and ii) tried to
define morphologically recognisable monophyletic entities. Using the best estimate
of the phylogenetic relationships of ICGs within the H. crustuliniforme complex, we
addressed the following questions:#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. How many morphological taxa, consisting of (strictly) monophyletic groups of ICGs
(biological species) can be recognised in this complex?#Misc-exposition*]

of ICGs affect the number of phenetic species that can be recognised?#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]
[@MATERIAL#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sexual intercompatibility was tested for 110 collections (Aanen & Kuyper, 1999).
This analysis led to the recognition of at least 20 intercompatibility groups (ICGs). Two
collections (isolates 9692 and 9694) were not compatible with any of the other collec-
tions. However, since these collections have neither shown compatibility in intracol-
lection pairings nor in intercollection pairings, the possibility that these two collections
were ‘incompetent’ could not be excluded (R. Petersen, pers. comm.). Therefore, it was
not warranted to give a formal status as ICG to these two collections. However, assum-
ing that the two collections are competent, they represent two other ICGs. We therefore
consider them as representants of two further biological species: ICG 13 and ICG 22.
The macroscopical characters were determined for all 110 collections, the microscopy
for 78 collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MORPHOLOGICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF ICGS AND
MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS USED#Misc-exposition*]

[@Each ICG was described morphologically and the range of character states was describ-
ed for each ICG. The morphological characters used are listed in Table I. Many of these
characters are quantitative. Full descriptions of the ICGs are given in the Appendix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS AND COMBINING DATA SETS#Misc-exposition*]

[@For clade I (the H. velutipes clade), we had only the ITS data to reconstruct an organ-
ismal phylogeny. For clade IIa, we had different data sets. The first estimate of the
phylogeny was based on ITS sequences (Aanen et al., 2000a). Clade Ia, except for the
two ICGs of H. pusillum, was studied in detail using different sequences: the nuclear
IGS and a mitochondrial intron (Aanen et al., 2000b). Here we include IGS sequences
of the two ICGs of the morphospecies H. pusillum, ICG 7 and 9. We performed a new
parsimony analysis with the inclusion of those two additional taxa. For the details of
the parsimony analysis we refer to Aanen et al. (20002). Gaps were coded according to
Hibbett et al. (1995) for all data sets. The reason that we used gap coding for the ITS
data here but not in Aanen et al. (20002) is that the analysis here was limited to a group
of closely related taxa, the alignment of which was straightforward, whereas the align-
ment with the extended data set was more ambiguous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sixteen collections were common for the two nuclear data sets, the ITS and IGS
sequences (ICG 1: 9503, 9618, 9621, 9673; ICG 2: 9570, 9627; ICG 3: 9680; ICG 4:
9602; ICG 5: 9581; ICG 7: 9654; ICG 8: 9538; ICG 9: 9509; ICG 14: 9566; ICG 15:
9624; ICG 20: 9688; ICG 21: 9650). Eleven collections were common for all data sets
(ICG 1: 9503, 9618, 9621, 9673; ICG 2: 9570, 9627; ICG 3: 9680; ICG 4: 9602; ICG 14:
9566; ICG 20: 9688; ICG 8: 9538). The Partition Homogencity Test (Farris et al., 1995;
Huelsenbeck et al., 1996b; implemented in PAUP*) was used (with 1000 replicates) to
determine whether the different data sets were in conflict. In this test, the observed sites
from all genes for each individual are pooled and resampled without replacement to
give an artificial data set in which sites have been swapped randomly among loci. Many#Misc-exposition*]

[@such artificial data sets are produced. MP trees are then made for each newly sampled
partition in each artificial data set. If the data sets have the same evolutionary history,
the sums of the lengths of the gene trees for the observed and resampled data should
be similar, but if they have different evolutionary histories, the sums of the tree lengths
should be longer than that for the actual data, because of extra homoplasy in the data
(Geiser et al., 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Furthermore, some alternative topologies were tested. Three species traditionally
considered to be ‘good’ morphospecies are H. crustuliniforme sensu stricto, H. pusillum
and H. lutense. We first did a parsimony analysis with the constraint that the biological
species of which the morphospecies H. crustuliniforme consisted (ICGs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
formed a monophyletic group. Secondly, an analysis was performed with the morphospe-
cies H. pusillum as a monophyletic group (ICGs 6, 7, 8 and 12). Thirdly, a constrained
analysis was performed with the morphospecies H. /eucosarx as a monophyletic group
(ICG 14 and 15). The constrained trees found were compared with the unconstrained
trees using the Kishino-Hasegawa (1989) test and Templeton’s (1983) nonparametric
test as implemented in PAUP*.#Misc-exposition*]

[@STRATEGY TO ARRIVE AT AN OPERATIONAL TAXONOMY#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first species concept that was tested as an operational species concept was the
biological species concept. We considered the morphology of biological species and
tested if different biological species could be recognised by morphological criteria. We
recognised the possibility that biological species could represent paraphyletic taxa. For
eight ICGs we have included more than one strain in the phylogenetic analysis: ICGs 1,
2, 3,4, 9, 11, 17 and 21. For those ICGs we tested the hypothesis that strains of a single
ICG form a monophyletic group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second species concept that was tested as an operational species concept was
based on combinations of biological species within a phylogenetic framework. On the
basis of an estimate of the phylogenetic relationships within Hebeloma, we tested for
every sister group whether both sister taxa could be morphologically separated. The
morphological descriptions of the ICGs were used to do this. As an initial help, we used
aset of 13 morphological characters, divided into discrete classes (Table II). Sister taxa
were separated if they showed no overlap in at least one of these characters. If both of
them could indeed be unambiguously demarcated, they were (at least provisionally) ac-
cepted as valid phenetic species. The process was then repeated at the next higher level
till all sister group relations had been dealt with. If sister taxa could not be recognised
separately as phenetic species, both sister taxa were lumped and the morphological
variability for the composite species was assessed. Again the process was repeated till
all sister group relations had been dealt with. We introduced an additional criterion for
recognition, viz. that morphological relationships between such provisional morphotaxa
could be upheld across hierarchical levels. Essentially, in this approach the two sister
groups A and B, even when sufficiently different to be kept apart by standard taxonomic
practice, were lumped when clade C, the sister group of AB, could not be treated as
separate from either group A or B.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In cases where the consensus cladogram did not yield sister group relationships but
showed unresolved polytomies, each taxon in a polytomy was compared with every
other taxon. Inevitably, this could result in a complex pattern of relationships within the
polytomy where some taxa could be unambiguously separated from each other whereas
some other ones could not. Again, the criterion of consistency across levels was used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A more relaxed version of this procedure was tested as well. In this version, para-
phyletic taxa were recognised, viz. when the sister groups A and B could be separated,
but clade C could only be separated from A, but not from B, we recognised the mono-
phyletic A, and the paraphyletic (B, C).#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@PHYLOGENY OF ICGs#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the 16 collections for which both ITS and IGS sequences were determined, we
determined whether these data sets were in conflict using the partition homogeneity test.
The actual summed tree length of 171 was equal to or longer than 65.6% of the artificial
data sets, indicating that the gene trees did not have significantly different topologies
(Fig. la). Therefore, we combined the ITS and IGS data sets to reconstruct a nuclear#Misc-exposition*]

[@phylogeny. The sister taxon of clade II, H. sarcophyllum was used as the outgroup. Doing
a parsimony analysis with gaps coded according to Hibbett et al. (1995), four trees were
found of length 237 (c.i. = 0.86; excluding uninformative characters, | = 113, c.i. — 0.69),
the strict consensus of which is depicted in Fig. 2. For the 11 collections for which all
three sequences were determined, we also did the partition homogeneity test. The actual
summed tree length of 134 was smaller than 99.9% of the artificial data sets, indicating
that the gene trees did have significantly different topologies (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we
conclude that the mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies can not be combined. Aanen
et al. (2000b) showed that the incongruence between the nuclear and mitochondrial
tree was mainly due to ICG 1, which had a different position in both phylogenies. As
a possible cause we proposed a hybridisation with different mitochondrial and nuclear
contributions. Here we use the nuclear phylogeny, but we consider the consequences
of other positions of ICG 1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RECOGNIZABILITY AND MONOPHYLY OF ICGS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the appendix morphological descriptions are given of 20 ICGs and two putative
ICGs (ICGs 13 and 22). Hebeloma incarnatulum is the single ICG that can be separated
from all the other taxa of the H. crustuliniforme complex by the shape of its cylindrical
to very narrowly clavate cheilocystidia. All other species of this complex have clavate
to (sub)capitate cheilocystidia. Of the ICGs represented by more than one collection,
ICGs 1, 2, 9 and 21 were monophyletic, and the two strains of ICG 11 had identical
ITS sequences but did not form a monophyletic group. The partially compatible ICGs
3 and 4 did not form monophyletic groups, together they constituted a monophyletic
group, however. Strains of ICG 17 did not form a monophyletic group. Two ITS types
were found within this ICG that belonged to two different clades.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MONOPHYLETIC RECOGNISABLE ENTITIES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since most of the ICGs could not be uniquely characterised, we tested if we could
recognise monophyletic combinations of ICGs. For every sister group we tested whether
both sister taxa could be morphologically separated. The consecutive steps for combin-
ing ICGs into monophyletic units are illustrated in Fig. 3 and described in Table III. Some
of the characters of the morphological descriptions of the ICGs and of combinations of
sister groups are presented in Table II.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To illustrate the procedure, we discuss some examples. At the lowest taxonomic
level some sister groups could not be separated and were combined and others could be
separated and were, at least provisionally, maintained (Fig. 3 and Table III). ICG 1 and
14 could be separated on the basis of general habit and pileus colour and were therefore
maintained at this point. The same was the case for ICG 5 and 7 (stipe-pileus ratio and
pileus colour). However, in subsequent steps, those taxa could not be maintained any
longer, because ICG | could not be separated from 5. ICGs 10 and 15 could be separated
on the basis of pileus colour, spore form, and general habit (stipe-pileus ratio). These
taxa were therefore maintained at this point. However, the sister group of the pair [10,
15], ICG 20, could not be separated from 10, although it could be separated from 15.
Therefore, these three taxa were lumped to g.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This analysis ultimately led to the recognition of 2 morphologically recognisable
monophyletic groups, one consisting of three ICGs (clade I), and one consisting of 19
ICGs (clade II). If paraphyletic species would be recognised, ICG 18 (H. incarnatulum)
could be recognised as an additional monophyletic morphospecies, with the two ICGs
of H. velutipes forming a paraphyletic phenetic species. The acceptance of paraphyletic
taxa (e.g. the pair [1, 5] or [10, 20]) did not have any influence on the final number of
species recognised in clade II. Only the moment of combining ICGs was postponed in
some cases if paraphyletic entities were (temporarily) accepted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONSTRAINED ANALYSIS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The main difference between the nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies was the posi-
tion of ICG 1. In the mitochondrial tree, ICG | belonged to a clade together with ICG
2, 3 and 4 (and probably 5, see hypothesised gain and loss of different introns in Aanen
et al., 2000b). To test the hypothesis that ICG 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 formed a monophyletic
group in the nuclear tree as well, we did a parsimony analysis on the nuclear data set
with the constraint that H. crustuliniforme was monophyletic. A total of 16 trees were
found of length = 241, which could not be rejected in favour of the unconstrained trees
(Kishino-Hasegawa test: p z 0.10, Templeton's test: p z 0.22). Performing the sister
group analysis on the strict consensus tree of those 16 constrained trees did not give other
conclusions than the analysis of the unconstrained trees. However, under the relaxed
version of the sister group analysis, viz. if we recognised paraphyletic taxa as well, the
5 1CGs of H. crustuliniforme could now be recognised as a monophyletic group versus
the paraphyletic rest of clade II.#Misc-exposition*]

in both cases). We conclude that the ICGs of the morphospecies H. lutense do not form
a monophyletic group and that H. /utense can not be maintained as a valid species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most biological species could not be recognized using morphological characters. Only
ICG 18 could be separated unambiguously from the remaining taxa. ICG 18 is accepted
as the phenetic species H. incarnatulum (Smith, 1984). The remaining ICGs could not
be uniquely characterised, implying that cryptic biological species are the rule within
the H. crustuliniforme complex. Similar observations have been made in other species
groups such as the Corticiaceae (Hallenberg, 1991) and the genera Paxillus (Fries,
1985) and Laccaria (Mueller, 1991; Mueller & Gardes, 1991), although in some cases
morphological differences could be found between ICGs. The biological species of
the H. crustuliniforme complex are also not meaningful ecological entities. Most col-
lections (70%) of H. crustuliniforme and H. helodes were made with members of the
Salicaceae as the ectomycorrhizal host tree while most collections of H. velutipes (93%)
were made with other trees as ectomycorrhizal hosts. As the first group consisted of 19
biological species, with very short branch length in the molecular phylogeny, we conclude
that extensive speciation took place after a host switch. Extensive speciation after host
switches is apparently not uncommon. The same phenomenon has been reported for Suil-
lus (Kretzer et al., 1996) and Leccinum (H. den Bakker, pers. comm.). It is also known to
occur in several species complexes in the genus Lactarius (three spp. of the L. obscuratus
complex associated with A/nus; four spp. of the L. torminosus complex associated with
Betula (Molina et al., 1992)). Interestingly, extensive speciation after host switches to the
Salicaceae has occurred at least in three clades in Hebeloma, viz. the H. crustuliniforme/
H. helodes clade, the H. mesophaeum complex ( Vesterholt, 1989) and the H. sacchariolens
complex (Gróger & Zschieschang, 1981). One would be tempted to speculate whether
there is a causal relationship between the host switch to Salicaceae and fungal speciation.
Salicaceae belong to the monophyletic order Malphigiales. All families in this order form
arbuscular mycorrhiza, except Salicaceae that form predominantly ectomycorrhiza. The
most parsimonious explanation for this pattern of host tree colonisation is that Salicaceae
have been colonised by ectomycorrhizal fungi separately and probably relatively recently.
The colonisation of this new and empty niche may have been the factor that favoured rapid
speciation. Rapid speciation in the genus Hebeloma may also be related to a recent eco-
logical switch from saprotrophy to the mycorthizal symbiosis. Both the genus Hebeloma
and its sister group Alnicola (Aanen et al., 2000a; Peintner et al., 2001) contain species
that live as ectomycorrhizal symbionts and species that have (maintain) a saprotrophic life
style, e.g. on old fire places. The sister group of that clade may be the saprotrophic genus
Agrocybe (Aanen et al., 2000a; Moncalvo et al.. 2000).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Aanen & Kuyper: Biological and phenetic species concept in Hebeloma crustuliniforme 299#Page-header*]

[@Since most of the biological species in this species complex could not be recog-
nized, we tested if monophyletic (or paraphyletic, but not polyphyletic) combinations
of biological species could be recognized by morphological criteria. Crucial in this ap-
proach was to have a reliable estimate of the phylogeny of the biological species. The
two nuclear data sets were shown to be not significantly different and were therefore
combined. The mitochondrial based phylogeny, however, was shown to be significantly
different. We used the nuclear phylogeny as our best guess for the phylogeny of the
ICGs, but we considered the mitochondrial based tree as well. If paraphyletic taxa are
recognised, three taxa can be recognised. Under the constraint that the five ICGs of
H. crustuliniforme (ICOs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) form a monophyletic group, trees are found
that can not be rejected against the most parsimonious tree. The idea that the five ICGs
of H. crustuliniforme form a monophyletic group is in agreement with the mitochon-
drial tree.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After evaluating the pros and cons of a phenetic species concept that allows inclusion
of paraphyletic groupings of biological species and groupings of biological species that
can not be rejected as belonging to a monophyletic group, we decided to accept four
phenetic species in the H. crustuliniforme complex. They are keyed out as follows.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Aanen & Kuyper: Biological and phenetic species concept in Hebeloma crustuliniforme 301#Page-header*]

[@Notes — 1. Hebeloma velutipes is well recognized by relatively broad, dextrinoid
spores and clavate, non-capitate cheilocystidia. Many collections also show a number
of the following characters: pileus with hygrophanous spots; stipe distinctly bulbous
(H. bulbiferum Maire); stipe hollow with pendent marrow strand; part of the cheilo-
cystidia with bifid apex. The taxon is accepted as a paraphyletic phenetic species, con-
sisting of ICG 16 and 17. Hebeloma leucosarx sensu Vesterholt and H. longicaudum
sensu Keizer & Arnolds are identical (ITS-RFLP patterns of both taxa studied, D.K.
Aanen, unpubl. obs.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. In the literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi the name H. crustuliniforme is very
repeatedly encountered. It is likely that many, if not most, of these cultures actually
refer to H. velutipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. Hebeloma longicaudum has originally been characterised by a pale pileus and
a long stipe. However, the case of H. pusillum serves as a warning with regard to the
taxonomic value of habit characters. Descriptions of several pale-coloured ICGs also
indicate that habit can be very variable. The name is therefore considered a nomen ambi-
guum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. Hebeloma leucosarx was described by Orton (1960) as a species with relatively
slender spores, distinctly capitate cheilocystidia and associated with Salix. On the
basis of that description it has been considered a member of the H. helodes complex
by Dutch mycologists. Vesterholt (1995), however, noted that the holotype had dis-
tinctly dextrinoid spores and non-capitate cheilocystidia, which makes this collection
a member of the H. velutipes clade. Vesterholt also suggested that H. velutipes might
be identical. We have not studied the type. Considering the divergent interpretations
of the name H. leucosarx, the name is not accepted in our paper; instead we con-
tinue to use the name H. velutipes. Hebeloma leucosarx sensu auct. neerl. belongs to
H. helodes (q. v.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. Hebeloma fragilipes Romagn. was defined on the basis of the shape and median
wall thickening of the cheilocystidia. The microscopical characters mentioned by
Vesterholt (1992, 1995) on the basis of a large number of collections from a number
of European countries, suggest both elements of H. velutipes (spores distinctly dextri-
noid, cheilocystidia that are not much swollen apically) and H. helodes (spores index-
trinoid, oblong to fusiform). Slightly thick-walled cheilocystidia have been observed in
both ICG 16 and 17 (H. velutipes) and in various ICGs of the H. helodes complex (also
mentioned by Vesterholt); our collections with a somewhat thickened cheilocystidial
wall (in median or apical part) were completely interfertile with specimens with thin-
walled cystidia, so we think that at least some doubt exists whether this morphospecies
could be maintained. No collections have been made by us that exactly fit Vesterholt's
descriptions, so we refrain from a conclusion about its taxonomic status.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat — Usually associated with Salix, sometimes with other deciduous trees (Popu-
lus, Quercus, Betula, Fagus, Tilia), exceptionally with conifers (Picea, Pinus).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes — 1. Hebeloma helodes was originally described as a taxon very close to
H. pusillum (same habit, same size, and same colour). Subsequent authors have
gradually enlarged this circumscription (H. helodes sensu Vesterholt, 1995, is paler) or
misinterpreted the name (H. helodes sensu Keizer & Arnolds). Bruchet (1970) did not
treat H. helodes. On the basis of our cladogram H. helodes is accepted as the name for
a paraphyletic grouping, as a sister group to H. crustuliniforme, which is considered
a separate phenetic species. Species circumscription of H. helodes is still quite broad,
which is consistent with the relatively high amount of molecular variation (compared
to H. crustuliniforme). Intermediates between H. helodes and H. crustuliniforme
could possibly occur (cf. H. cavipes, note 3). Considering the wide circumscription of
H. helodes, it becomes inevitable that H. pusillum and H. lutense have to be included;
this conclusion is not surprising, considering the enlarged description of H. helodes by
Vesterholt. As a consequence, variation in morphology and microscopical characters
is substantial. The phenetic species is comprised of ICGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15,19, 20, 21, 22.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. The name H. helodes is not the oldest name available. We decided to use it as a
name that is less liable to confusion over its application and circumscription than e.g.
H. pusillum or H. hiemale.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. Hebeloma cavipes was accepted by Vesterholt (1995) as a valid species, only
known from the type collection in an open vegetation under Cistus. Vesterholt noted
that in its microscopical characters it was very similar to both H. crustuliniforme and
H. helodes, and these three taxa could only be kept apart on the basis of size, hollow
stipe (also a supposed characteristic of H. alpinum, see under H. crustuliniforme),
and cheilocystidia that are often widened in the basal part. As the species is known
trom one collection only, it is likely therefore that finding additional collections of
H. cavipes could either collapse the distinction with H. crustuliniforme (if somewhat
larger specimens were found) or with H. helodes (if smaller specimens were found).
Vesterholt further suggested that H. cavipes could be conspecific with H. lutense (note
6), a species that is usually regarded as having a darker pileus and for that reason was
not treated in Vesterholt (1995). A culture collection of H. cavipes had the same ITS
sequence as collections of H. hiemale, H. lutense (ICG 15), and H. helodes (ICG 10).
The taxon is therefore accepted as a synonym of H. helodes.#Misc-exposition*]
[@304 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@4. Hebeloma hiemale was not treated by Vesterholt. According to Bruchet (1970) it
is a xerophilous species, usually associated with Cistus in the Mediterranean region,
although he also cited a note from Huijsman that the species is common in the Dutch
dunes (which raises suspicion that it is very close to H. /utense, see note 6). On the basis
of the species description, it seems to come very close to H. helodes. The ITS sequence
of a culture collection of H. hiemale was identical to those of H. cavipes, H. lutense
(ICG 15) and H. helodes (ICG 10). The taxon is therefore accepted as a synonym of
H. helodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. Hebeloma leucosarx was described by Orton (1960) as a species with relatively
slender spores, distinctly capitate cheilocystidia and associated with Salix. On the basis
of that description it has been considered a member of the H. helodes complex by Dutch
mycologists. Vesterholt (1995), however, noted that the holotype had distinctly dextri-
noid spores and non-capitate cheilocystidia, which makes this collection a member of
the H. velutipes clade. Vesterholt also suggested that H. velutipes might be identical.
We have not studied the type. Considering the divergent interpretations of the name
H. leucosarx, the name is not accepted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. In the Netherlands H. lutense (= H. leucosarx sensu auct. neerl.) is recognized
mainly by habit (relatively stout specimens, compared to H. pusillum) and habitat (usu-
ally associated with Salix repens often in early successional, relatively open sites). The
first character may reflect an adaptation to the relatively open structure (and hence drier
microclimate) of S. repens vegetation. The species also differs from several interpreta-
tions of H. helodes by darker colours. Collections that fit the description of H. lutense
belong to two different ICGs. ITS sequence of ICG 15 is similar to that of H. cavipes,
H. hiemale, and H. helodes (ICG 10). A constrained tree in which both ICGs with the
characteristics of H. lutense were combined, had to be rejected. Morphological vari-
ability within some of the ICGs also suggests that H. /utense can neither be separated
from H. helodes nor from H. pusillum. Vesterholt (1995) suggested that H. lutense could
be a synonym of H. cavipes (note 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@7. The name H. pusillum is used for small and slender specimens with a dark pileus,
associated with Salix. The species is somewhat variable in spore size. This species also
gota slightly enlarged circumscription, e.g. by Bruchet (1970; where it almost certainly
includes H. helodes) and Phillips (1981; which also seems to fit better into the concept of
H. helodes). H. pusillum consists of four different ICGs. A tree, constrained to make
Hebeloma pusillum a monophyletic entity, must statistically be rejected against the most
parsimonious trees, indicating that the defining characters of H. pusillum (slender habit
with small basidiocarps) have likely arisen repeatedly.#Misc-exposition*]

[@8. Hebeloma fragilipes Romagn. was defined on the basis of the shape and median
wall thickening of the cheilocystidia. The microscopical characters mentioned by
Vesterholt (1992, 1995) on the basis of a large number of collections from a number of
European countries, suggest both elements of H. velutipes (spores distinctly dextrinoid,
cheilocystidia that are not much swollen apically) and H. helodes (spores indextrinoid,
oblong to fusiform). Slightly thick-walled cheilocystidia have been observed in both ICG
16 and 17 (H. velutipes) and in various ICGs of the H. helodes clade (also mentioned
by Vesterholt); our collections with a somewhat thickened cheilocystidial wall (in
median or apical part) were completely interfertile with specimens with thin-walled
cystidia, so we think that at least some doubt exists whether this morphospecies could#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes — I. Hebeloma crustuliniforme as presently conceived by Vesterholt (1995) is
maintained as an autonomous species, after the criteria of monophyly and parsimony are
relaxed to include paraphyletic groupings of ICGs and less parsimonious trees that can-
not be rejected against the most parsimonious trees. Moreover, the mitochondrial tree
supported the monophyly of ICGs 1, 2,3 and 4 of H. crustuliniforme and did not exclude
the possibility that ICG 5 belonged to it as well. It consists of ICG 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. In the literature on ectomycorrhizal fungi the name H. crustuliniforme is very
repeatedly encountered. It is likely that many, if not most, of these cultures actually
refer to H. velutipes.#Misc-exposition*]
[@306 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@3. The application of the name Agaricus fastibilis Pers. :Fr. was extensively discussed
by Kuyper & Vesterholt (1990). They concluded that the name, as originally conceived,
referred to a taxon very close to H. crustuliniforme. However, another interpretation
has been widespread in which H. fastibile is a cortinate species, also recently known as
H. mesophaeum var. crassipes (Vesterholt, 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. Hebeloma alpinum was originally described by Favre (1960) as a variety of
H. crustuliniforme. Favre invoked a number of morphological characters to delimit this
taxon (small habit, broader lamellae, hollow stipe) but wondered whether these characters
might just reflect adaptations to the microclimatic conditions in the alpine zone. However,
as Favre did not observe specimens that were transitional between the alpine variant and
the typical H. crustuliniforme (actually, he did not even observe typical H. crustuliniforme
in the upper subalpine zone), he considered these differences to be genetically fixed and
hence worthy of recognition on varietal status. Bruchet (1970) elevated the taxon to spe-
cies rank and gave an enlarged description of it (much larger size than Favre's taxon, taste
less bitter), whereas Vesterholt (1995), who also accepted species status, used a partly
different set of characters than Favre to keep this taxon apart (spores weakly dextrinoid,
in H. crustuliniforme indextrinoid or nearly so). Our alpine collections from this group
showed substantial variation in size. They belong to three different ICGs, two of which
contained both alpine and lowland collections (ICGs | and 2), and one of which (ICG 4)
was partially compatible with a lowland ICG (ICG 3). Partial intercompatibility between
these four ICGs furthermore strongly suggest that H. alpinum can not be maintained any
longer. Moreover, in a phylogeny between populations of these ICGs, the alpine popula-
tions did not form a distinct monophyletic group (Aanen et al., 2000b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A CONSENSUS TAXONOMY FOR THE H. CRUSTULINIFORME COMPLEX?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the characters used, traditionally and also in this study, in Hebeloma taxonomy,
are quantitative. Different types of characters can be recognised. First, there are characters
that are absolutely discriminating between taxa, one taxon always has state A, whereas
the other taxon always has state B. Such characters are rare in this group of ICGs. In fact
the only character of this type is the shape of the cheilocystidia, with a unique state for
H. incarnatulum. A second type of characters are characters that have a rare unique state.
The presence of such a state is informative and can be decisive to place a specimen in
a certain taxon, whereas its absence is uninformative. Examples of such a character are
cheilocystidia with a bifid apex, or the presence of hygrophanous spots on the pileus. Both
characters have only been found in H. velutipes and never in H. helodes or H. crustulini-
forme. However, in H. velutipes these character states do not occur constantly. Therefore,
only the presence of this state is informative, whereas its absence is not. Some combinations
of characters are unique for certain species groups and can be used as well. The combi-
nation of characters, coded in Table IIT, is such a set. This combination of characters, of
which none is necessary, is jointly sufficient to assign a collection to the phenetic species
H. velutipes. The individual characters that comprise a set, however, do not necessarily
uniquely characterise phenetic species. Relatively broad spores, or slender, non-capitate
cheilocystidia occur in H. helodes and H. crustuliniforme, but the combination of these#Misc-exposition*]
[@Aanen & Kuyper: Biological and phenetic species concept in Hebeloma crustuliniforme 307#Page-header*]

[@characters has never been encountered in this clade. The last type of characters we recog-
nise are statistical characters. For example, 74% of the collections of H. helodes and
H. crustuliniforme have been found with Salicaceae, whereas only 7% of the collections
of H. velutipes. The latter species usually occurs in association with members of Pinaceae,
Fagaceae and Betulaceae. Such characters can never be decisive themselves but can give
additional support for doubtful collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The lack of reliable qualitative characters may seem surprising, considering the
number of species described in that group. The almost complete similarity in micro-
scopical characters between the different intercompatibility groups is consistent with a
scenario of a slow evolution (or even stasis) of morphological characters. However, as
the molecular data show a high sequence similarity and consequently short branch length
between biological species, especially in the H. crustuliniforme/H. helodes clade, it is
more likely that the members of the group diverged only recently, with ITS sequences
evolving at slower rates than compatibility characteristics and micro-morphological
characteristics evolving at an even lower rate, while some macroscopical characters
are highly plastic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A scenario of rapid speciation would at first sight contradict the existence of well
recognised morphospecies such as H. alpinum, H. pusillum or H. lutense. However,
both latter taxa had to be rejected because phylogenetic trees, in which these taxa were
constrained to form a monophyletic group, performed significantly worse. It is more
likely, that these morphospecies are recognised on the basis of plastic characters such as
habit (length / width ratio of stipe; ratio of pileus diameter and stipe length) and that these
characters reflect more habitat conditions than genetically fixed characters. A similar
explanation may be true for H. alpinum, where again differences in habit (small pileus,
short and thick stipe) could be more plastic than normally assumed. The high plasticity
and variability in macroscopical characters and the relative uniformity in microscopical
characteristics may ultimately be the explanation for our failure to recognise more than
four phenetic species with a minimal phylogenetic quality in this taxon complex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The comparison of a biological and morphological species concept within a phylo-
genetic framework indicated that these various concepts can not be reconciled to pro-
duce an unambiguous, unique solution to the species problem in the H. crustuliniforme
complex. Even under the assumptions (which not all mycologists would accept!) that
i) the phylogeny estimate is sufficiently accurate and ii) the value of morphological
characters has been exhaustively studied, the number of species ultimately depends
on the rules of the game (acceptability of paraphyletic groupings, acceptability of less
parsimonious trees that can not be rejected in favour of the most parsimonious tree). It
would therefore be necessary to seek consensus about these rules, so that these incom-
patible demands on taxonomy (species should really exist, be recognisable and have
minimal phylogenetic quality) can be sorted out and an acceptable solution can be found
for this complex. Between the Scylla of morphology (which would have forced us to
accept taxa that must statistically be rejected because of lack of phylogenetic quality)
and the Charybdis of the biological species concept (which would have forced us to
produce a taxonomy that can not be applied in daily practice), the recognition of four
species seems a workable alternative.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PRIMORDIUM FORMATION IN HYDROPUS SUBALPINUS
(TRICHOLOMATALES, BASIDIOMYCETES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@H. CLÉMENÇON#Misc-exposition*]
[@Département d’ Ecologie et d' Evolution, Université de Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hydropus subalpinus is exocarpic amphiblemate. The pubescence of the stipe is a
cauloblema that sometimes forms a spurious partial veil in young primordia. The
pileoblema becomes a gelatinised pileipellis with a few more or less erect cells on
the pileus and a few layers of periclinal physalohyphae on the pileus margin. The
stipe and pileus contexts are sarcodimitic, and the morphogenetic function of the
physalohyphae during the expansion of the stipe and the pileus is discussed, based
on specimens with an aborted sarcodimitic structure. The carpogenesis of Hydropus
subalpinus is similar to that of Hydropus anthidepas and Baeospora myosura.#Abstract*]

[@The genus Hydropus (Kühner) ex Singer contains about 100 species of mycenoid,
collybioid or omphalinoid gilled fungi with sarcodimitic stipe trama composed of
spindle-shaped, strongly inflated physalohyphae and very thin, often tortuous genera-
tive hyphae. Most species are tropical (Singer, 1982); only six or seven species occur
in Europe (Moser, 1983). On inspection with a hand lens, an overwhelming number of
species show no trace of a veil, not even in young basidiomes, and are thus considered
gymnocarpic. However, very young fruit-bodies of Hydropus omphaliniformis Singer
show a fugacious, silky veil connecting the margin of the pileus with the stipe (Singer,
1982: 40). This species is therefore considered to be hemiangiocarpic (Singer, 1982:
13) or monovelangiocarpic (Singer, 1986: 415), but no detailed study was made to back
up Singer's statements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comer (1966: 185) gives a more detailed description and schematic drawings of the
development of the tropical Hydropus ( ‘Trogia’) anthidepas (Berk. & Broome) Singer
and concludes that it shows “a very slight, false veil over the incurved pileus margin”.
Nevertheless he calls this species gymnocarpic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species occurring in temperate regions have never been studied. Bas (1999: 166),
probably based on Singer (1986), writes “development gymnocarpic or monovelangio-
carpic", while Watling & Turnbull (1998 : 131) write "development unknown", probably
referring to European species only.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mid May 2003 many basidiomes of Hydropus subalpinus (Hóhn.) Singer developed

[@time storage at about 4°C (Feder & O’Brien, 1968). Thirty-six noduli and primordia were
embedded in a 7 : 3 mixture of glycol methacrylate and butyl methacrylate and serial
sectioned with a microtome. The 5-8 µm thick sections were stained with 0.0146 basic
fuchsine in distilled water or with aluminium zirconium haematoxylin (Clémençon,
2000). Selected sections were photographed with an Olympus DP11 digital camera
mounted on a Leitz Ortholux microscope, and the photographs were prepared for print-
ing using Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh computer (magnification, picture cropping
and contrast were adjusted, small impurities were brushed away, but no morphological
changes were made).#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Development of the primordium#Misc-exposition*]

[@A summary of the early development of Hydropus subalpinus is shown in Fig. 1
& 2. The erumpent nodulus (Fig. 1a) is hemispherical, but noduli may also be more
spherical (Fig. 4a). Noduli soon become conical by apical growth (Fig. 1b). Later the
apex enlarges to form the pileus rudiment (Figs. 1c, d). The pileus and the stipe become
covered with a floccose metablema (Figs. Id-f, li), but later the pileus becomes smooth
again, as the pileoblema is transformed into a gelatinous pileipellis (Figs. Ig. h, j-1). In
normally developing specimens the stipe becomes enlarged and conical, and the pileus
is broadly convex to rounded-conical; but in aborted specimens the stipe remains cylin-
drical and the pileus becomes bell-shaped or parabolic (Fig. 1m). This is due to the
absence of laterally exerted pressure because the turgescent sarcodimitic structure does
not develop. About one third of all studied primordia showed this type of abortion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Four representative developmental stages are shown in Fig. 2: a nodulus with begin-
ning elongation and early cauloblema (Fig. 2a); a young primordium with the pileus
initial, the first pileoblema, and the onset of the differentiation of the sarcodimitic struc-
ture in the stipe (Fig. 2b); an intermediate stage with a smooth prehymenial palisade
and the cauloblema forming a temporary partial veil (Fig. 2c); and an older primordium
with well-developed sarcodimitic stipe context, beginning sarcodimitic structure in the
pileus, well-developed, anticlinal pileoblema and stipitoblema, early gills and basal
hyphal cords (Fig. 2d).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The vegetative mycelium in the substrate (wood of Fagus silvatica) is quite sparse,
each wood cell containing only very few hyphae; but where noduli are formed, the
density of hyphae in the wood becomes very high just beneath the wood surface (Fig.
3). Adense mycelial mass composed of parallel hyphae ruptures the wood surface and
grows out to produce a nodulus (Figs. 4a, 5a, 6. 7). Noduli may be formed on top (Figs.
4, 5) and on the sides of a buried Fagus branch (Fig. 6).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Noduli have a denser core surrounded by a loose outer layer (Figs. 4b, 5b). The
hyphae in the base and in the lower part of the nodulus are intertwined while showing
a general longitudinal orientation. They are more irregularly arranged in the upper part
and in the loose outer layer. All hyphae are thin-walled. The part buried in the wood
consists mainly of inflated hyphae, perhaps a means of breaking the wood surface by#Misc-exposition*]
[@Clémençon: Primordium formation in Hydropus subalpinus 319#Page-header*]

[@pressure; but in the nodulus itself, significant hyphal inflation has not yet occurred.
Noduli grow out vertically to produce a shaft of intertwined but generally longitudinal
hyphae. When a nodulus is located on a horizontal surface of the Fagus branch, a conical
body is formed, as shown in Figs. 1b and 5a. Noduli located at the vertical side of the
Fagus branch also grow out vertically, so that the shaft is upright, parallel to the wood
surface and forms a right angle with the basal mycelial mass bursting out of the wood
(Fig. 6).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Primordium formation begins with the growth of a vertical shaft composed of as-
cending, but slightly interwoven, thin hyphae (Figs. Sa, b). Since the shaft has a smaller
diameter than the nodulus the resulting body is conical with a rounded apex. From the
sides of nodulus and the shaft inflated hyphae grow out and form a floccose metablema;
but when a surface touches a foreign body or the soil, no metablema can grow. Therefore
the occurrence and form of the metablema is very irregular in primordia growing within
the soil. The apex of the primordial shaft is often covered with a very thin, compacted
layer, probably the result of the pressure of the growing shaft against the soil. This layer
can be called a primordial cortex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the length of the primordial shaft reaches about one or two quarters of the
diameter of the nodulus, a pileus rudiment is initiated (Fig. 6). The apical context be-
comes more irregular, and hyphae grow outward in a curved line. The surface hyphae
of the pileus initial are slightly inflated like the ones of the shaft metablema. Over the
pileus margin they form a compact periclinal layer curving down and growing toward
the shaft surface, but on the apex they are usually less compacted and may even produce
some erect end cells. At this stage no prehymenial palisade is present under the margin
of the pileus initial.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the onset of pileus formation, some hyphae in the nodulus and primordial shaft
begin to expand by turgescence. They are the future spindle-shaped physalohyphae of
the sarcodimitic stipe context. Because of this hyphal expansion the stipe initial becomes
even more conical.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When the pileus reaches a diameter of about 500—600 zum, a prehymenial palisade
is already well formed, but gill initials are still lacking (Figs. 7, 8). In the stipe trama
some hyphae begin to inflate enormously, forming spindle-shaped physalohyphae. In
the centre of the pileus the physalohyphae are arranged irregularly, but towards the
pileus margin they take a radial orientation. Therefore, the pileus trama also becomes
sarcodimitic.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hyphae of the upper part of the floccose metablema on the stipe grow obliquely
upward in direction of the pileus margin, and sometimes they reach it (Fig. 9). But as
the pileus expands more rapidly than the metablema grows, the false veil thus formed
is of short duration.#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the underside of the pileus gills begin to grow down from the prehymenial palisade.
The young gill trama is divergent (Fig. 10a), but the descending hyphae are not parallel
when seen in a section parallel to the hymenium (Fig. 10b). In this stage, the pileoblema
is often well-developed and forms a floccose layer of erect hyphae (Figs. 2d, 11).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In older primordia the gill trama contains physalohyphae Fig. 12a). The primordial
hymenium consists of slender, club-shaped cells and big, vesicular cystidia (Fig. 12b).
The gill trama and a thin layer between the pileus trama and the gills are partly or wholly
gelatinous. The stipe elongates and thickens considerably through the inflation of the#Misc-exposition*]
[@320 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@physalohyphae that become the dominant structures by volume. The hyphae of the
pileoblema run parallel to the pileus surface with some more or less erect, club-shaped
end cells towards the pileus margin. Over the centre of the cap the pileoblema is strongly
gelatinous (Fig. 13a). The thickness of the gelatinous layer decreases toward the cap
margin and the number of free end cells increases (Figs. 13b, c). The margin itself is
dry.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The stipe base sometimes contains crystals of unknown composition (Fig. 14a). In
some specimens the crystals are so numerous às to form an opaque cloud; in others only
a few isolated crystals can be seen. The crystals are surrounded by a thin, irregular layer
of a material staining brown-red with zirconium-haematoxylin and vinaceous red with
toluidine blue, indicating a polysaccharide (Fig. 14b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Young primordia lack a strigose basal mycelium. About the time when the pileus
initial appears, hyphal cords begin to grow out from the basal part of the nodulus. This
is clearly visible in Fig. 1d. These hyphal cords do not develop significantly until the
primordium begins to grow gills. They radiate from the stipe base and are composed
of thin, cylindrical, almost parallel, vegetative hyphae only (Fig. 15). Rarely a hyphal
compartment contains some deuteroplasm (Fig. 15c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the stipe and pileus trama of older primordia#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sarcodimitic structure in the sense of Vellinga (1998) is evident in the stipe,
the spindle-shaped physalohyphae being up to 20 j/m wide, with compartments up to
about 1800 µm long. They develop from longitudinal generative hyphae by increase of
their diameter and length without significant increase of the cytoplasm, which becomes
highly vacuolated (Fig. 16). The hyphal cells are multinucleate; some compartments,
although incomplete in the sections, show 8 nuclei. The walls of the physalohyphae are
slightly thicker than the walls of the accompanying generative hyphae and take a more
pronounced red-brown colour when stained with zirconium-haematoxylin, indicating
à firmer wall. It is difficult to measure the walls with the light microscope, but image
analyses with the computer indicate a wall thickness of 0.20—0.24 µm, compared to
0.12-0.15 µm for the walls of nearby generative hyphae. In the bottom of the stipe the
physalohyphae are irregularly arranged and often contorted, but in the upper part they
are straight and morc or less parallel. A sarcodimitic structure is also seen in the pileus,
but here the physalohyphae are irregularly arranged. (Fig. 17). Many physalohyphae
are terminated with a free ending upper cell reminiscent of acrophysalides (Figs. 16a,
18-20). The generative hyphae of the stipe are 3—5 µm thick and frequently ramified.
Lateral branches wind their way between the physalohyphae (Fig. 21). They are clamped
and binucleate, and are the typical *hyphes connectives' of Fayod (1889) and Kühner
(1938), presumably increasing the mechanical cohesion of the stipe context.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development of the hymenial cystidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cystidia of mature basidiomes of Hydropus subalpinus were described by Kühner
(1938, as Mycena subalpina) as being "atténuées supérieurement ou contractées en un
col cylindrique" and by Watling & Turnbull (1998) as "narrowly lageniform with a
subobtuse to obtuse apex ...". Both descriptions fit my own observations of the cystidia#Misc-exposition*]
[@Clémençon: Primordium formation in Hydropus subalpinus 321#Page-header*]

[@of this fungus which is common in my collecting sites (Fig. 23). I have never seen any
other type of cystidium in mature basidiomes of this species, but in young primordia
broadly vesicular cystidia with a rounded apex are common (Figs. 10a, 11a, 12b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In older primordia, the broadly vesicular cystidia of neighbouring gills often meet
at or near their apices, and together they bridge the gap between the gills (Figs. 22a, b).
It is possible that the bridging cystidia have a similar morphogenetic function as the
trabecular cystidia in Coprinus species, as described by Chiu & Moore (1990, 1993),
but positive evidence is missing for Hydropus. Since in mature basidiomes all cystidia
are lageniform and no dead or shriveled cells are present in the hymenium, it is probable
that the vesicular cystidia of the primordium change their form when the gills separate
during maturation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Aborted primordia without sarcodimitic context#Misc-exposition*]

[@About one third of the primordia studied were aborted specimens, characterised by a
non-dilated, about cylindrical stipe and an excessively incurved pileus margin (Figs.1m,
24). Although aborted, they were not entirely dead. They consisted of narrow, often
contorted hyphae embedded in a gelatinous mass, but the spindle-shaped physalohyphae
were totally lacking in the stipe and pileus trama (Fig. 25). Aborted primordia failed to
differentiate the sarcodimitic context. It is possible that the gelatinous mass containing
the narrow, contorted hyphae results from the disintegration of the physalohyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Obviously the stipe remains cylindrical because there are no physalohyphae to extend
the stipe trama. The same is true for the pileus that becomes bell-shaped instead of con-
ical. The pileus margin curls strongly because it is covered by normally inflated hyphae
that presumable exert an inward pressure that is not compensated for. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to assume that the striking physalohyphae of the sarcodimitic context are a
major morphogenetic factor.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most aborted primordia were infested with nematodes, but the cause of abortion is
unknown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@So far the only other Hydropus species studied in some detail is Hydropus anthide-
pas (Berk. & Broome) Singer (Corner, 1966: 185, as Trogia anthidepas). Hydropus
subalpinus and H. anthidepas are both amphiblemate, but the fate of the pileoblema is
different in the two species. In H. anthidepas it remains dry and forms a pruinose layer
of erect cells; and “hyphal ends on the pileus may grow out ... [and] may meet excres-
cent hyphae form the stem or primordial disk and build a very slight, false veil over
the incurved pileus margin” (Corner, 1966). In H. subalpinus the pileoblema becomes
an ixocutis bearing only a few, scattered, more or less erect cells; and no hyphae grow
out to meet the cauloblema. Thus, H. anthidepas is slightly amphicleistoblemate in my
terminology (Clémençon, 1997), whereas H. subalpinus is fleetingly caulocleistoblem-
ate, or does not form any partial veil in some specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

depends on the immediate surrounding of the primordium, narrow contact with the soil
may accelerate the transformation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The development of Hydropus subalpinus is reminiscent of the carpogenesis of Baeo-
spora myosura, which forms similar metablemas and a spurious false veil (Clémençon,
in press). The main differences are the much earlier differentiation of the sarcodimitic
structure and the less pronounced and more fugacious veil in Hydropus subalpinus. Both
genera are phyogenctically closely related sister groups (Hibbett & Binder, 2002; Mon-
calvo et al., 2002). Developmental morphology confirms molecular taxonomic conclu-
sions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The high frequency of nematodes in aborted primordia suggests that the nematodes
feed on the fungus. They may secrete a substance that increases the permeability and/or
decreases the mechanical resistance of the hyphal walls for easier feeding, thus provok-
ing the collapse of the turgescent physalohyphae. This hypothesis remains to be tested,
because the nematodes could also be attracted by the primordia already aborted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genera Fayodia Kühner (1930: 68) and Gamundia Raithelh. (1979: 34) are some-
times considered subgenera of the broader genus Fayodia (e.g. Singer, 1986). However,
Kühner (1980) as well as Bon (1997), Bigelow (1979), and Kuyper (1995a, b) dis-
tinguished both as independent genera. This concept is accepted in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Fayodia is characterised especially by having a very distinct, two-lay-
ered basidiospore wall and a dry, not gelatinised pilei- and stipitipellis. Gamundia is
distinguished by verruculose-echinulate, thin-walled, non-amyloid basidiospores and a
gelatinised pileipellis. The results of the revisions of all type specimens preserved and
available in herbaria and their descriptions in literature are summarised in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

reagent, Congo Red, and KOH. For the basidiospores the following factors are used:

[@Type revision. The type specimen has not been received for revision since it was on
loan for a long time. The type revision by Horak (1962) was therefore used: basidio-
spores 6.5-8.0 x 6.5-8.0 µm, (sub)globose, distinctly of two layers — verruculose-
echinulate epispore and smooth perispore, verruculae 1.0—1.2(-1.5) µm high, hyaline
in KOH. Basidia 22-27 x 5.0-7.0 µm, 2-spored, clavate to subutriform or subfusoid.
Cheilocystidia numerous, 45 —60 x 9.0—15 jem, subutriform, subcylindrical or subfusoid,
+ thin-walled. Pileipellis a cutis made up of radially arranged, cylindrical, thin-walled,
minutely brown incrusted hyphae. Clamp-connections absent in all tissues. Chemical
reactions: no part of tissue dextrinoid or amyloid. Basidiospores with non-amyloid
epispore including verruculae and amyloid perispore.#Description*]

[@Notes. This fungus is similar to Fayodia bisphaerigera, but differs especially in hav-
ing smaller mycenoid carpophores with darker pileus, smaller basidiospores, clampless
tissues, and by its occurrence on burnt ground. Also the warts on the spore wall seem to
be narrower than in F. bisphaerigera. It represents a distinct taxon, and its correct name
is Fayodia anthracobia (J. Favre) Knudsen var. anthracobia.#Misc-exposition*]

spores which are often broadly ellipsoid or subglobose, and by growing in mosses and
lichens in arctic and alpine communities with Dryas or Salix spp. on calcareous soil.
Gulden (1988) mentioned that some Gamundia-species may be connected with a lichen
(Peltigera sp.). SEM-microphotographs showed that basidiospores have low, indistinct
warts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kuyper (1995b) considered it a synonym of G. striatula. However, on the basis of the

constantly smaller basidia (16—21 x 6.5—9.0 µm), more frequently present (broadly)
clavate cheilocystidia, and by growing on peat soil. Its basidiospores often peel in
microscopic preparations and peeled basidiospores (slightly thick-walled perispore)
are sometimes dextrinoid. Other features fully agree with F. anthracobia. Bon (1997)
also mentioned F. anthracobia as rarely growing on peat soil. Fayodia bisphaerigerella

clear if Britzelmayr’s fungus really represents this species. Basidiospores are described

not mention either 2-spored basidia or (of course) amyloidity. Therefore, I propose to

[@Notes. Fayodia hygrocyboides is especially characterised by having small carpo-
phores, a honey-coloured pileus with a well-delimited brown centre and only a few
lamellae (L = 13-16). Having thin-walled and minutely echinulate inamyloid basid-
iospores, it belongs to the genus Gamundia Raithelh. In the SEM-microphotograph,
basidiospores have distinct and sharply delimited warts (in contrast to other Gamundia
species, except for G. lonatii). It represents a well-delimited separate species with the
correct name Gamundia hygrocyboides (Lonati) Bon.#Misc-exposition*]

priority. However, since the type specimen of Omphalia leucophylla Gillet is not pre-
served and the original description (Gillet, 1874) is too short and unclear, I have decided
to use Kühner's name for this taxon. Moreover, the epitheton /eucophyllus has been
used in several senses in literature (for details see Lange & Sivertsen, 1966). I propose
to consider the name Omphalia leucophylla Gillet a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

thick-walled cheilocystidia and by growing in xerophytic stands. It belongs to the genus
Gamundia Raithelh. Bon (1996, 1997) and Bon & Róllin (1999) considered this taxon

variability, F. xerophila differs from G. striatula only in the slightly darker coloured
pileus and a different ecology: basidiospores of both species are identical in SEM
photomicrographs. This difference is considered too small to distinguish two taxa. We
therefore consider it identical with Gamundia striatula (Kühner) Raithelh.#Misc-exposition*]

[@TWO INTERESTING RECORDS OF BOLETES
FOUND IN COFFEE PLANTATIONS IN EASTERN MEXICO#Misc-exposition*]

[@VICTOR M. BANDALA, LETICIA MONTOYA & DANIEL JARVIO#Misc-exposition*]
[@Instituto de Ecologia, A.C., P.O. Box 63 Xalapa, Veracruz, 91000 Mexico#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fresh collections of boletes gathered in coffee plantations from the State of Veracruz
(Gulf of Mexico) were investigated. They belong to species of the poroid genus
Phlebopus (P. portentosus) and the lamellate genus Phylloboletellus (P. chloephorus).
Basidiomata of each species grew on the ground under coffee plants near trees of
Enterolobium, Ficus, Inga, and Spondias. The two species are described and illus-
trated.#Abstract*]

[@The cultivation of coffee is an important agricultural practice in Mexico. Coffee planta-
tions occupy areas of variable extension, and are found in regions dominated by more
than one type of vegetation (Moguel & Toledo, 1999). In the Central area from the Gulf
of Mexico (State of Veracruz) coffee plantations represent one of the most common
agro-systems introduced amongst remnants of native woods which are transformed into
managed forests or into monospecific plantations (Jiménez, 1979; Jiménez & Correa,
1980; Escamilla et al., 1995). Except for the unshaded (or sunny) system of coffee
production, the management of the remaining four recognized types of coffee agro-
ecosystems (Fuentes, 1979; Moguel & Toledo, 1999) involves the maintenance of trees
originally established in the areas or replaced by different plant species. It offers a range
of canopy levels and produces vegetationally and structurally diverse systems which
still embrace an important biological diversity (Moguel & Toledo, 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The documentation published on the diversity of macromycetes from the Gulf of
Mexico region embraces especially information on species occurring in different forests,
and data on the macrofungi inhabiting coffee plantations (under different degrees of
management) are practically absent. These agro-ecosystems are currently a component
of the vegetation covering the sites dedicated to the cultivation of coffee. As part of
the native biological diversity of Mexico, it is of interest to document the diversity of
macromycetes inhabiting these coffee systems. Compared with forest areas, the macro-
mycetes component in coffee fields is perhaps lower in terms of original representatives
(especially ectomycorrhizal). However, a high diversity of species which have found
suitable habitats or even refuge in such systems under both wild or introduced trees can
be expected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As part of our fieldwork undertaken to study the macromycetes inhabiting the broad-
leaved tree forests from Central Veracruz (Gulf of Mexico) (Bandala & Montoya, 2002),
some visits to different coffee-producing localities have been made. We selected some
sites at different altitudes and under different levels of management in order to program
periodical observations. The boletes studied herein grew in two shaded coffee planta-
tions; these latter, according to their characteristics, seem to be intermediate between the
so-called traditional and commercial polycultures (Fuentes, 1979; Moguel & Toledo,#Misc-exposition*]
[@366 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@1999). Both sites are established in a warm region at 1,000 m above sea level. The for-
est cover, remnant of a tropical deciduous forest, comprises native elements like trees
of Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Jacq.) Griseb. (*nacaxtle") and Spondias mombin L.
(‘jobo’), including some native or introduced trees of the genus /nga spp. (‘jinicuil’ and
"chalahuite"). Planted elements found in the sites are Ficus calyculata Mill. (‘higuera’).
and some members of Cedrus, Citrus, Musa, among others. The two boletes studied
represent species of the poroid genus Phlebopus (R. Heim) Singer 1936 and the lamel-
late Phylloboletellus Singer 1951, which are scarcely documented in Mexico and
typically reported from natural (uncultivated) forests (Bandala et al., 1988; Guzman &
Guzmán-Dávalos, 1984; García et al., 1986; Singer et al., 1990), although it is said that
their members are not necessarily forming ectomycorrhiza (Singer, 1986; Singer et al..
1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomes were recorded in fresh condition. Annotations of colours in brackets were
codified following Kornerup & Wanscher (1967) (for the description of Phylloboletellus
chloephorus), and Kornerup & Wanscher (1978) (for Phlebopus portentosus). Colours
codified as 2.5Y 8/8; IOYR 8/4 in PAylloboletellus chloephorus refer to the Munsell
color chart (1994). For the microscopic study hand sections of dry basidiomes were
mounted in 5% KOH, 1% Congo red (aqueous solution) and Melzer's reagent. Line
drawings of microscopic structures were made with the aid of a drawing tube. The desig-
nations used for the basidiospore measurements are: Rm = range of means in n collec-
tions; Qm = range of means of Q (length/ width ratio). All measurements of microscopic
structures were made in KOH (potassium hydroxide). The scanning electron microscope
(SEM) photographs were obtained after mounting small pieces of dry hymenophore
which were previously fixed in glutaraldehyde, critically point dried, and later coated
with gold-palladium. Herbaria acronyms are based on Holmgren et al. (1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The following set of features was found to be distinctive in our collections and
relates with P. portentosus: pileipellis with more or less slender terminal hyphae (in
a trichodermoid arrangement), presence of clamp-connections, absence of pleuro-
cystidia, markedly swollen cheilocystidia, brown pigmented basidiomes, irregularly
stained with brownish red or vinaceous to dark vinaceous colours, and minute pores
(s 1 mm). Mexican specimens (of different sizes) shared a similar range of brown col-
ours (not dark or blackish), with olivaceous tones mainly on the stipe. The pileipellis
in all studied basidiomes is composed of somewhat slender terminal hyphae (Fig. 1b,
€). However, slightly swollen terminal hyphae were detected scattered among the
pileipellis, but even in younger basidiomes, no traces of a hymeniform-like arrange-
ment is present. Singer et al. (1990) were not convinced by the characteristics used by
Heinemann & Rammeloo (1982) regarding the terminal elements from the cover layer
of the pileus (i.e. swollen or not). In reports of P. portentosus (McNabb, 1968; Corner,
1972; Pegler, 1977, 1986; Singer et al., 1983, 1990) the pileipellis is described as bear-
ing cystidiform, clavate, acuminate or otherwise swollen terminal hyphae, with obtuse
or rounded apexes. Although the monospecific subg. Hymenophlebopus s. Heinem.
& Rammeloo was proposed for the group with pileipellis bearing swollen terminal
hyphae, Heinemann & Rammeloo (1982: 397) recognized that in the type specimen of
Phlebopus beniensis (Singer & Digilio) Heinem., “... le revétement piléique semble
formé d'hyphes cylindracées; nouns n' y avons vu aucun élément renflé mais l'état du
matériel ne permet pas d'affirmer catégoriquement leur absence ...". Furthermore, the
material from Martinique (Pegler 2818) referred to by Heinemann & Rammeloo (1982)
with very characteristic swollen terminal hyphae on the pileipellis, was later published
as P. beniensis by Pegler (1983) who described it as having erect, cylindric, lageniform
or fusoid, terminal elements. We agree with Singer et al. (1990) that P. portentosus
exhibits a pileipellis with somewhat swollen terminal hyphae but such elements do not
constitute a hymeniform structure. The basidiome colours, and size and shape of both
cheilocystidia and basidiospores are, therefore, the most reliable characters to distinguish
P. portentosus from P. beniensis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pores of the Mexican specimens consistently presented broadly clavate cheilo-
cystidia, i.e. swollen and apically rounded (Fig. 1c). In the tubes, however, we did
not find any kind of sterile structure that demonstrated the presence of pleurocystidia.
The hymenial cystidia of Phiebopus portentosus have been mentioned as scattered on
the pores, and rare in the tubes, and clavate to more rarely clavate-subglobose, often
basidiole-shaped (Singer et al., 1990) or they were not observed (Pegler, 1977) or were
even mentioned to be absent (Boedijn, 1951; McNabb, 1968; Corner, 1972; Pegler,
1986). The description of P. portentosus by Singer et al. (1990) includes cheilocystidia
12-38.4 x 5.5-16 µm, at times 16 x 6 µm, more or less similar to those found in our
collections. It would be interesting to analyse in future collections the consistency of
the shape of the cheilocystidia, and the presence or absence of these and facial cystidia,
and to correlate this data with other independent characters (micro- or macroscopic,
including basidiome size) in order to verify if populations of different taxa are called
P. portentosus. For example, Heinemann & Rammeloo (1982) underlined that some#Misc-exposition*]

[@specimens that McNabb (1968) placed under P. portentosus presented a net in the upper
part of the stipe surface, but that most samples of this species lack such a structure.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiospores of studied collections when seen under light-microscope are smooth
and with a rather remarkable peripheral darker colour of the wall, hence they appear
moderately thick-walled (up to 1 jem thick). Similar to the report by Pegler & Young
(1981), Mexican samples show smooth walls when analysed under SEM. Perreau (1981)
emphasized this character but demonstrated, using transmission electron microscopy.
that the basidiospores of P. portentosus are partially minutely denticulate. Basidiospore
measurements of our collections fit the lower limit of size dimension reported for
P. portentosus (Boedijn, 1951; McNabb, 1968; Pegler & Young, 1981; Heinemann &
Rammeloo, 1982; Pegler, 1986), although Pegler (1977) and Singer et al. (1983, 1990)
reported a more or less similar size: 6-8.7 x 4.2-6.3 µm (7.7 x 5.4 µm), 6.5-8.7
x 4.2-6.3 µm or 5.5-9,5 x 4.8-6.8 µm, respectively. Three short-spored species
superficially similar to P. portentosus are P. colossus (R. Heim) Singer, P. beniensis
and P. silvaticus Heinem. They are, however, clearly different when compared with the
former species. Basidiomes of P. colossus are often larger, with a very dark brown or even
blackish pileus during some stages of development (Heim, 1936; Heinemann, 1954a;
Heinemann & Rammeloo, 1980; Singer et al., 1983). Basidiomes of P. beniensis and
P. silvaticus completely lack olivaceous tinges, the latter species has basidiomes which
show brown colours but are distinctly red stained (pileus and stipe). context unchanging
on exposure, apparently the cover layer of pileus bears strictly vesiculous terminal hyphae
and has brownish or carmine pigments, and the basidiospores although moderately small
(6.5—8.6 x 5.7—7.3 µm or 6.8—7.5 x 5.7—6.3 µm) are somewhat broader (Q 7 1.18—1.28
in average) (Heinemann, 1951, 1954a; Heinemann & Rammeloo, 1980, 1982). Phle-
bopus silvaticus has, according to Pegler (1977), a pale ochraceous context which
becomes green to brown on exposure, clavate to vesiculose terminal hyphae of the
pileipellis, and basidiospores 8—9.5 x 5.7—7 µm (8.7 x 6.2 µm in average). Furthermore.
P. beniensis has been described with cheilocystidia "... extremely variable, mostly
fusoid-obtuse to subventricose, but some subcylindric-flexuous or clavate ..." (Singer
et al., 1990), but also having an appendiculate apex (Singer & Digilio, 1960; Singer.
1964) or a narrowly mucronate or rounded tip (Singer et al., 1983), even with a resinous
incrustation as illustrated by Pegler (1983, fig. 115n).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most type material supporting the accepted species of Phlebopus, as emphasized
by Heinemann & Rammeloo (1982), is in a poor state of conservation. The present
conditions of the specimens have restricted the analysis of several microscopic fea-
tures, hence at this level those authors found few characters suitable for taxonomic
purposes. However, data on basidiospore dimensions as displayed by Heinemann &
Rammeloo (1982), reveal some tendencies among species (at least with the number
of samples measured) regarding the basidiospore size and shape. These authors state
that basidiospore characteristics (size, shape) prove to be informative at infrageneric
level, however, these characters alone could hardly be discriminating among related
species. Diagnosis of the species provides little information on microscopic features.
and in subsequent descriptions the geographic distribution and colour of basidiomes
may have been overemphasized when distinguishing the populations. The microscopic
variability of the basidiomes has scarcely been documented, and it is more or less well
known in a limited number of species (Heinemann, 1951, 1954a & b; Heinemann &#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylloboletellus chloephorus has only been found to date in two widely separated
areas in the American continent, including a record from Mexico. The species was
described by Singer & Digilio (1951) based on collections gathered in subtropical or
tropical montane forests from Argentina. Since then, subsequent citations by Singer
(1964, 1970) and Singer et al. (1992) were translations of the original description, con-
sidering the same three specimens of the first finding, plus two from the same locality
collected years later by Singer (Singer, 1964, 1970). As acomplement to the diagnosis,
Horak (1968) and Pegler & Young (1981) provided detailed information mainly of
microscopic characters, based on paratype material. The Mexican collections treated
by Singer et al. (1992) were those on which Garcia et al. (1986) previously based their
record of P. chloephorus in Mexico. The latter authors collected their specimens in a
*matorral espinoso', a heterogeneous low forest influenced by dry weather which in-
cludes elements of dry deciduous forests and xerophylous shrubs. This area is situated#Misc-exposition*]
[@378 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@in NE Mexico (State of Nuevo Leon), so our present finding of P. chloephorus in the
central area of the Gulf of Mexico corresponds with the second report of the species in
the country and records the most southern limit of its currently known distribution in
Mexico. The occurrence of P. chloephorus in lowland plantations, amongst remnants of
a tropical deciduous forest, suggests a marked affinity for warm weather conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In all publications by Singer (et al.) referred to above, the type of P. chloephorus is
indicated as R. Singer T 1/26, either as: “... Prov. Tucumán: Rio de Los Sosas, 27.1.1951
..." (Singer & Digilio, 1951; Singer, 1964; Singer et al., 1992), or as: * ... Tucumán:
Quebrada de Los Sosas, Playa Grande, 21.1.1951 ..." (Singer, 1970). We received from
LIL the above mentioned collection Singer & Siemseii s.n., dated 27.1.1951, which is
labelled (in handwriting) as typus. According to information from the curator at LIL.
the sample is kept as the type of the species. Additional data on the label (see above)
agree with published information, therefore, part of our interpretation of the species is
based on this specimen which we consider to be the holotype. It consists of one half of
a more or less well-preserved basidiome (although with a mould on part of the hymeno-
phore and stipe), and in fact, its macro and microscopic features agree with data in the
diagnosis. Nevertheless, the present stage of preservation of the sample did not allow us
to rehydrate the hymenial tissues appropriately, which made it difficult to corroborate
the presence of hymenial cystidia as described by Singer & Digilio (1951). We studied
one of the specimens from Nuevo Leon (Moreno s.n., 8.V1.1984) treated by Singer et
al. (1992), and since that specimen and our collections showed all the distinctive char-
acters found in both the specimen Singer T 3580 (see Singer, 1964, 1970) and Singer
& Siemseii s.n., we interpreted them as being conspecific. The following data are based
on the type study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiospores 10—12 x (8—)9—10 µm (10.9 x 9.6 jem on average), broadly ellipsoid to
short-ellipsoid, without germ pore, ochraceous to yellow-brown, longitudinally costate,
with 16—18, forked or somewhat anastomose, longitudinal ribs, 1—2 µm high, extending
beyond the apex and weakly attenuated towards the hilar appendix, without transversal
lines (Fig. 2a; Plate 2c). inamyloid, some with a greenish tint. Hymenophoral trama
bilateral, with a narrow, slightly gelatinized mediostratum of yellowish, somewhat
compactly interwoven, hyphae 4—6 µm wide, thin-walled, yellowish brown when
grouped; lateral stratum more clearly gelatinized, composed by flexuous or curved,
loosely arranged, thin-walled, hyaline hyphae 2—4 µm wide. Pileipellis a moderately
loose ixocutis in transition to an ixotrichodermium, which consists of a slightly gela-
tinized, variable narrow layer (not refringent) of undifferentiated, more or less parallel,
cylindric to somewhat filamentous, yellowish to hyaline, thin-walled hyphae (3-)4-6
µm wide, in some zones the terminal hyphae are moderately erect and irregularly ar-
ranged, and more abundant in some areas than in other.#Description*]

[@Singer et al. (1992) argued, after studying the collections from Nuevo Leon and
comparing Argentinean specimens, that the former may represent a subspecific taxon
which they provisionally named ‘var. mexicanus’. Critically comparing the combina-
tion of characters pointed out in the different descriptions of P. chloephorus (Singer,
1964, 1970; García et al., 1986; Singer et al., 1992), these specimens appear to be in-
termediate between the type and other Argentinean materials. Our collections consist
of basidiomes which exhibit differences in their development, and were collected under#Misc-exposition*]

[@different conditions (drawings of Fig. 4 show part of the elements of some specimens
examined). These materials allowed à more detailed analysis of their morphologic
features. The set of characters stated by Singer et al. seems not to be of taxonomic help
for distinguishing more than one population. Among the examined samples we found
a consistent macro- and microscopic variation which embraces that of the Argentinean
specimens and that points to *var. mexicanus": a) pileus surface with relative abundance
of fibrils in the centre and margin, less abundant towards the latter after pileus expan-
sion, so the pileipellis appears more markedly trichodermoid in young stages or even
at pileus margin whereas more cutis-like with erect terminal hyphae in most part of
the disc in certain stages of pileus development; b) an intermediate variation of pileus
shape (convex to moderately umbonate or even plane); c) lamellae partially or almost
entirely stained reddish brown (especially in advanced stages or on very bruised areas);
d) flesh with a different degree of bitter flavour; and e) the pileipellis hyphae consist-
ently gelatinized (with a variable degree of gelatinization). We interpret the morphologic
differences shown by the examined samples as being those to be expected as part of the
variation of members of a single species. Although the specimens currently known of P.
chloephorus come from two distant areas, in the absence of any correlated character that
supports robust differences among the samples, we fail to distinguish distinct subspecific
taxa. Singer et al., in fact, were not completely convinced about the taxonomic validity
of the ‘var. mexicanus’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NEW SPECIES OF OCTOSPORA AND SOME FURTHER
REMARKABLE BRYOPARASITIC PEZIZALES
FROM THE NETHERLANDS#Misc-exposition*]

[@DIETER BENKERT! & EMIEL BROUWER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@This article presents an overview of remarkable findings of bryoparasitic Pezizales
in the Netherlands collected in the period 1995-2002. These collections provide
further insight into the distribution, ecology, morphology and host relationships of
the species described, some of which represent unknown taxa. Three new species
are described, primarily or exclusively based on collections from the Netherlands:
Octospora neerlandica, O. fissidentis and O. nemoralis. The following connections
with host-mosses were observed: Tortula ruralis s.str., T. ruraliformis, T. virescens
with O. neerlandica, and Fissidens bryoides with O. fissidentis as well as O. nemora-
lis. As a result of the intensive field survey, the number of species known from the
Netherlands has increased from 14 to 40. This indicates that current knowledge on
the distribution of bryoparasitic Pezizales is very incomplete in many countries.#Abstract*]

[@At the end of the past century it became clear that the number of bryoparasitic Pezizales
in the Netherlands, belonging to the genera Octospora, Lamprospora and Neottiella,
was considerably higher than formerly presumed (Brouwer, 1999). Revision of critical
findings revealed the presence of remarkable and sometimes formerly unknown species,
for example Octospora gemmicola Benkert (Benkert, 1998a). Previously unknown as-
sociations with host-mosses were also observed. Many further interesting collections
have been made since by the second author and examined by the first author. Some of
these specimens again represented unknown taxa. As more specimens of these taxa
became available for examination, the taxonomic significance of their characteristics
could be more fully assessed. Three new species of Octospora as well as some additional
species of more than just regional importance are therefore presented in the following
text. Some additional collections from the Netherlands may also represent new taxa,
but their relationship to other species requires further study.#Misc-exposition*]

subfusiform), and their length-width ratio is less than 1.5 (about 1.9 in O. fissidentis).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Octospora heterosculpturata shares the heterosculpturate spores with O. fissidentis.
It is, however, easily distinguished by wider spores, a smaller length-width ratio of the
spores, a different host-moss and a different colour of the hymenium. The flesh-col-
oured or + violaceous hymenium of O. fissidentis is rather unusual within the genus,
but is found in O. rustica (Velen.) J. Moravec, O. lilacina Seaver, and O. canariensis
Benkert. These species are, however, very different in shape and size of their spores,
spore-ornamentation and host-mosses.#Misc-exposition*]

by features of the spores. Their ellipsoidal-rapaceous shape is very typical, the maxi-
mum spore-width is somewhat eccentric. The two oil droplets of the spores are mostly
of unequal size, probably as a consequence of the spore-shape. The spores appear +
smooth under a light microscope. However, observation with scanning electron micro-
scope reveals that the surface of the spores is slightly uneven (Fig. 3 & 4). The spores
of Octospora leucoloma Hedw.: Fr. and the closely related O. gemmicola Benkert are
of almost identical shape but are slightly longer, 19—24 µm. Furthermore, O. leucoloma
spores usually contain one oil droplet and O. gemmicola spores are somewhat more nar-
row (Q = 2.1—2.4). Both species have smooth spores and very different host-mosses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Svréek & Kubicka (1961) reported the first localities of Octospora lilacina in Europe
and Kubitka (1979) observed that this species is widely distributed in Southern Moravia.
In Germany about 15 localities for O. lilacina were confirmed by the first author (Ben-
kert, 1995, partly), and Engel & Hanff (1985) published a colour photograph of German
material. Also some specimens were collected in Switzerland (B. Senn-Irlet, J. Gilgen)
and in Great Britain (Brouwer,1999). Although it was not known from the Netherlands,
Brouwer (1999) showed that O. lilacina was not rare near the city of Nijmegen. The
numerous records from the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Netherlands indicate
that O. lilacina may be widely distributed in Europe and that the very small apothecia,
immersed in moss-protonema, are easily overlooked.#Misc-exposition*]

[@POSTFACE#Misc-exposition*]

[@The inconspicuous and macroscopically similar apothecia of the bryoparasitic species
of Pezizales are seldom collected. Distribution and ecology of most of the species are
therefore inadequately known. As a result of the present intensive survey in the Nether-
lands, especially in the surroundings of Nijmegen, this is now one of the countries with
the highest number of recognised taxa of bryoparasitic Pezizales. These countries are
Germany (55 taxa), the Netherlands (45 taxa, mainly collected by E. Brouwer), France
(42 taxa), the Czech Republic (38 taxa), Norway (35 taxa, mainly collected by R. Kris-
tiansen) and Great Britain (26 taxa).#Misc-exposition*]

RUSSULA SECTION XERAMPELINAE
WITH A PREDOMINANTLY OLIVACEOUS PILEUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@SLAVOMIR ADAMCIK#Misc-exposition*]

[@Institute of Botany, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dübravská cesta 14,
SK-845 23, Bratislava, Slovakia; e-mail: Slavomir.adamcik € savba.sk#Misc-exposition*]

[@Original material of taxa of Russula sect. Xerampelinae with a mainly olivaceous
pileus are compared with selected specimens. It is demonstrated that Russula clavipes,
thought to be associated exclusively with conifers, may also occur with deciduous
trees and grows from the temperate lowlands to arctic areas. Nomenclature and
taxonomic status of other names used for similar taxa in this group are discussed.
Russula xerampelina var. elaeodes and R. nuoljae are treated as the only validly
published synonyms of R. clavipes.#Abstract*]

[@Kürcher & Seibt (1994) and Kürcher (1996, 1997, 2000a, 2000b) published the most
comprehensive recent studies on R. sect. Xerampelinae (Singer) Jul. Scháff., including
observations on type material. Karcher (2000b) accepted five taxa with a predominantly
olivaceous pileus, viz. R. clavipes Velen., R. cicatricata Romagn. ex Bon, R. fusco-
ochracea R. Schulz, nom. illeg., R. schaefferi Karcher and *R. xerampelina var. olivas-
cens (Fr.) Melzer & Zvara’. According to Karcher, R. clavipes and R. fuscoochracea
grow only in coniferous woods and the other three taxa exclusively in deciduous woods.
The abundance of inflated terminal elements in the pileipellis of R. cicatricata, which are
more rare in R. clavipes and R. fuscoochracea, and lack of these structures in R. schaef-
feri are considered the most distinctive characters to delimit species in this group (the
micro-morphological characters of R. xerampelina var. olivascens were not given). In
addition spore-ornamentation is considered important, R. clavipes and R. fuscoochracea
having short spines frequently connected by lines, R. cicatricata short and more isolated
spines, and R. schaefferi having longer and frequently connected spines.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In other recent literature very different taxonomic concepts of R. clavipes and related
taxa have been presented, including rather different ecological amplitudes of the treated
taxa. Reumaux et al. (1996) treat two similar species with an olivaceous, ochraceous or
brown pileus from coniferous forests and three from deciduous forests. Bon (1988) gives
one taxon with an olivaceous pileus from coniferous and five from deciduous forests.
Keizer & Arnolds (1995) considered all observed fruit-bodies with olivaceous pilei as
forms of R. graveolens Romell, but they studied only collections from roadsides with
deciduous trees. Knudsen & Stordal (1992) treat only one species with an olivaceous
pileus from the Nordic countries, viz. R. elaeodes (Bres.) Bon, which grows in both
coniferous and deciduous forests. Einhellinger (1987) did not have olivaceous taxa from
coniferous forests, but only two species from deciduous forests.#Misc-exposition*]
[@394 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@Numerous collections, made by the present author, of members of the xerampelina-
group with an olivaceous pileus from both coniferous and deciduous forests on moist soil
urged a critical emendation of the current concept of R. clavipes adding a contribution
to a further disentanglement of this difficult species complex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The material observed consists of several personal collections and a selection of
specimens from the herbaria BRA, C, M, PRM and W (including type specimens). The
description of character states and morphometry is extensively given in Adaméfk & Mar-
hold (2000) in which traditionally used characters are precisely defined or modified,
especially micro-morphological characters of spores and pileipellis. Single elements of
spore-ornamentation were observed in a circle of 3 j/m diameter on the spore-surface in
the upper plane of focus. Terminal elements of the pileipellis were observed at the margin
and centre of pileus respectively. All micro-morphological characters were observed
under oil-immersion lens at a magnification of 1600 x. Basidia and pleurocystidia were
observed in a solution of ammonia and Congo Red (according to Fábry, 1979), spores
were observed in Melzers reagent (Melzer, 1945), and the hyphae of the pileipellis were
observed in a solution of sulphovanillin (1 g of vanillin dissolved in 6 ml of distilled
water and 5 ml of concentrated vitriol acid).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DELIMITATION OF RUSSULA CLAVIPES#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fruit-bodies with a predominantly olivaceous pileus have been collected in Picea
forest (Slovakia and Italy) as well as under Betula and Alnus glutinosa (Slovakia). All
collections were made on moist soil. The macro-morphology of these collections and
characters observed on the hyphal termination of the pileipellis are similar to those of
the neotype of R. clavipes. The terminal elements of generative hyphae on the margin
of the pileipellis are subulate, attenuate or subcylindrical, relatively long (on average
longer than 25 jem and mostly exceeding 30 µm) and only rarely inflated to 6 µm or
more. Conversely the centre of pileipellis usually contains more than 20% of inflated
elements (6 µm thick or more). Pileocystidia are numerous, but in dried herbarium
specimens they contain only inconspicuous granules or heteromorphous elements,
for which reason they are sometimes very difficult to distinguish from the generative
hyphae. The sporal characters of all collections are similar to those of the neotype of
R. clavipes and clearly differ from those found in R. schaefferi, R. cicatricata or any other
similar taxa from deciduous forests. Spores of the type specimen of R. clavipes and the
specimens collected by the present author are small (their length rarely exceeds 9 jam);
narrow (on average Q = 1.25—1.35); with short and fine spines (length not exceeding
1.1 µm) which are numerous (6.5—11 spines in a circle of 3 µm diameter on the spore-
surface) and which have occasional line connections. All the characters mentioned
above are considered sufficient for the delimitation of R. clavipes as a species of its
own right, and this combination of characters were not observed in the type material of
other similar taxa of sect. Xerampelinae with a mainly green pileipellis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A large variability in the spores and some characters of the terminal elements of the
hyphae in the pileipellis have been observed. Some fruit-bodies (including the type#Misc-exposition*]
[@Adaméík: Russula clavipes and related taxa 395#Page-header*]

[@specimen) have shorter spines (0.6 µm) or more numerous line connections (1.5—2
line connections in a circle of 3 µm diameter on the spore-surface) than the majority of
other collections. A few of the fruit-bodies studied had occasional inflated elements in
the generative hyphae on the margin of the pileipellis, though the majority lacked them.
The proportion of inflated elements at the centre was also very variable, ranging from
15% to 60%. However, fruit-bodies with these atypical characters could occur within
a single collection or within collections of one ecological type (see habitat of R. clavipes
described in text following description of the species). These variable characters were
therefore not considered reliable for the delimitation of infraspecific taxa. The spores of
the collections from arctic areas of Greenland are usually somewhat larger than spores
of collections from the European temperate zone. This difference was observed also in
the related species R. subrubens (J. E. Lange) Bon and R. pascua (F.H. Moller & Jul.
Schäff.) Kühner, but the difference is only gradual (for both ecological types). The larger
spores of the arctic collections may be considered a climatic adaptation in relation to
the longer hibernation period.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Similar taxa with a green pileus from deciduous forests related to R. graveolens do
not have inflated elements of the generative hyphae at the centre of the pileipellis or any
such elements are very sparse and do not exceed 10% of the total number of terminal
elements. Inflated elements at the centre of pileipellis were only observed in material of
R. faginea Romagn. ex Adaméík (2003), R. cicatricata and R. pascua. Russula faginea,
R. pascua and related taxa differ from R. clavipes in having shorter and often inflated
(up to 6 µm or more) terminal elements of the generative hyphae at the margin of the
pileipellis. Russula faginea differs also in having spores with sparse spines (usually on
average not more than 6 spines in a circle of 3 jem diameter on the spore-surface). In addi-
tion, in this group of taxa the pileus is mainly red with a discoloured, ochraceous centre.
Russula cicatricata (4 collections examined including the type) differs also in often
having the terminal elements of the generative hyphae on the margin of the pileipellis,
which are very long and mostly thicker than 6 µm, with a specific shape (inflated in the
upper part and constricted at the base and the tip).#Misc-exposition*]

[@RUSSULA CLAVIPES IN PUBLISHED LITERATURE#Misc-exposition*]

[@After its publication by Velenovsky (1920), the name Russula clavipes has hardly
been used. Only 7 authors have been encountered who actually used the name, viz.:
Svréek et al. (1984), Kürcher (1996) and Reumaux et al. (1996). According to the stud-
ies of Karcher & Seibt (1994), Kürcher (1996) and the author's own observations, R.
clavipes has been described in literature under various names, including R. xerampelina
var. olivascens sensu Melzer & Zvära, R. xerampelina var. fusca sensu Melzer & Zvära
(see also misapplied names), and the valid but later R. xerampelina var. elaeodes Bres.
(Bresadola, 1929).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In his original description Velenovsky (1920) noted only one locality for R. c/avipes:
“in Picea and Abies forests near Babice, October 1918”. Svréek, Erhart & Erhartovä
(1984), who reintroduced the name, indicated that this species grows also in association
with Betula and Populus tremula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kürcher (2000a) and Reumaux et al. (1996) treated R. clavipes as a species associated
exclusively with coniferous trees, and moreover, they distinguished additional species#Misc-exposition*]
[@396 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@of coniferous forests with an olivaceous pileus: R. fuscoochracea (nom. illeg.) and
R. elaeodes (accepted only by Reumaux et al., 1996). Delimitation of these species is
based mainly on coloration of the pileus cuticle, which is disputed below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula elaeodes is a synonym of R. clavipes. The basionym R. xerampelina var.
elaeodes is the correct name on the rank of variety (following Art. 11.3 of the Inter-
national Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN, Greuter et al., 2000)). No herbarium
material collected or determined by Bresadola and labelled as R. xerampelina var.
elaeodes is known and the only available material for designating the type noted in the
protologue is pl. 420 (Bresadola, 1929) as iconotype. Following the original concept
of R. xerampelina var. elaeodes, it applies to a taxon with a mainly olivaceous pileus
associated with coniferous trees by several mycologists (such as Singer, 1932; Kühner
& Romagnesi, 1953; Knudsen & Stordal, 1992; Galli, 1996; Reumaux et al., 1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Romagnesi (1967), however, applied the name R. elaeodes to a different spe-
cies, followed by Bon (1983) and Einhellinger (1987). Kürcher (1996) described
R. schaefferi based on the specimens of R. elaeodes in the Romagnesi herbarium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Keizer & Arnolds (1995) treated the epithet eleaodes at the rank of a form of R.
graveolens. According to their description it is similar to R. graveolens in all micro-
morphological characters. They have observed only specimens collected on sandy soil
under Quercus, which probably relates to the variability of R. graveolens or similar
taxa, but surely differs from the original concept of R. xerampelina var. elaeodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another validly published synonym of R. clavipes is R. nuoljae Kühner. Kühner
(1975) delimited R. nuoljae on the absence of pileocystidia. According to our ob-
servations on the type material (deposited in herbarium G), this taxon has indistinct
(deformed) pileocystidia, typical for R. clavipes (with very weak granulation in sulpho-
vanillin). Other micro-morphological characters are also similar to R. clavipes: terminal
elements on the margin of pileipellis are mostly attenuated or subulate, terminal elements
at the centre are frequently inflated and spores have an ornamentation composed of fine
isolated spines. Kiihner described R. nuoljae only from one fruit-body collected under
dwarf Betula in an arctic area of Sweden. He described predominantly red colours of
the pileus, which does not fit well with the current concept of R. clavipes. Judging from
the type study, however, R. nuoljae is considered conspecific with R. clavipes and the
more red colouration of the pileus may be caused by longer exposure to sunlight.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES ON OTHER SIMILAR TAXA IN LITERATURE#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the taxa of Russula sect. Xerampelinae with a predominantly olivaceous pi-
leus several epithets have been used, viz. barlae, cicatricata, citrinocincta, clavipes,
cookeiana, duportii, elaeodes, fusca, fuscoochracea, ochracea, olivascens and schaef-
feri (with the exception of forms of R. graveolens with an olivaceous pileus cuticle, as
discussed above). No types have been designated for R. barlae, R. elaeodes, R. fusca,
R. fuscoochracea, R. ochracea and R. olivascens and the only available elements for
typification are the original descriptions and illustrations. Often the names have been
variously interpreted, leading to great confusion. The following species are briefly
discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula barlae Quél., Compt.-Rend. Assoc. Franc. Avancem Sci. 12 (1884) 504.#Nomenclature*]

[@Quélet (1884) described this as a species with firm, mild, whitish flesh; sweetish
smell; apricot-yellow to red-orange and then pale yellow pileus; white stipe, and pale
yellow spores. Although the original description does not include one of the characters#Misc-exposition*]
[@402 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@typical for Russula sect. Xerampelinae (flesh turning rusty-brown and with crab-like
smell when drying or damping off, reaction to FeSO, green), many authors applied it
to taxa of this section.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Melzer & Zvára (1927) treated it as variety of R. xerampelina (like other taxa of the
section) but their short description does not allow a secure interpretation. Schaeffer
(1933) also accepted the name R. xerampelina var. barlae (Quél.) Melzer & Zvára.
Original material of Schaeffer's preserved in Kew proves that this is identical with
R. faginea (terminal elements of generative hyphae at centre of pileipellis frequently
inflated and spore-ornamentation with numerous line connections). Also Blum (1961,
1962) noted in his description of R. xerampelina var. barlae characters typical for R. fagi-
nea: pileus cuticle reddish on the margin and ochraceous at centre, spore-ornamentation
with ‘fine reticulation’ and pileus cuticle with numerous inflated hyphae. According to
observations on the original material of Blum’s deposited in herbarium PC, R. barlae
sensu Blum is a species belonging to the group of R. brevis Romagn. ex Bon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Romagnesi (1967) suggested that R. barlae is only a form of R. cicatricata with a
more orange or reddish pileus and paler spore-print. The specimen from his herbarium
has inflated terminal elements at margin and centre of the pileus, fitting well with the
original concept of R. cicatricata. However, the spores are different from R. cicatricata:
line connections are more frequent, spines are shorter and spores are narrower (Q =
1.19-1.45). Einhellinger (1987) and Bon (1988) distinguished R. barlae from related
species (R. cicatricata and R. faginea) on the base of similar characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Reumaux et al. (1996) described R. barlae with pileus colour similar to the original
description, clearly differing from Romagnesi (1967). Russula barlae in their concept is
probably R. clavipes: spore-print is ochraceous (IITa— IIb), terminal elements subulate,
often with inflated subterminal cell and spores with short spines. They referred to the
ecology indicated in the original description of R. barlae (montane to subalpine forests
of Alpes Maritimes), but they interpreted it as a species of deciduous forests in the key
(R. clavipes grows also under Betula).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula favrei M.M. Moser, a species described from submountainous to subalpine
forests (Adam¢ik, 2002), may possibly also be synonymous with R. barlae in its original
sense. Considering the very brief protologue (Quélet, 1884) which does not allow a
modern interpretation, and the different concepts in literature, the name Russula barlae
must be considered a nomen dubium according to Art. 56.1 of the International Code
of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN, Greuter et al., 2000), as has been suggested earlier
(Krieglsteiner, 1987; Keizer & Arnolds, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula cicatricata Romagn. ex Bon, Doc. Mycol. 18 (69) (1987) 35.#Nomenclature*]

[@Russula cicatricata has been validly published by Bon (1987), referring to the origi-
nal description by Romagnesi (1967). Romagnesi considered the firm consistence of
the flesh, concentric wrinkles at margin of the pileus, olivaceous colour of the pileus
and presence of numerous inflated elements in the pileipellis as the most important
differentiating characters of the species. However, according to the study by Keizer &
Arnolds (1995) these characters are not reliable, because they may vary greatly within
one collection. Accordingly R. cicatricata was reduced by Keizer & Arnolds (1995) as
a mere form of R. graveolens. The present author agrees with the opinion of Keizer &#Misc-exposition*]
[@Adamtik: Russula clavipes and related taxa 403#Page-header*]

[@Amolds that macro-morphological characters cannot be used to define a specific status
for R. cicatricata, but additional microscopic characters, in the form of the combination
of numerous inflated elements with specific shape at centre and margin of the pileus
clearly differentiate R. cicatricata from R. graveolens and related species. The delimita-
tion of R. cicatricata from R. clavipes and R. faginea is discussed above.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Almost all specimens collected by Einhellinger (1987) and determined as R. cica-
tricata represent R. clavipes, according to a revision of the material deposited in
herbarium M. They were found in wet places under Betula or Picea (often in mixed
forests) and the spines of spores are short (according to Einhellinger, 1987). Only one
collection of Einhellinger found under Quercus was perhaps correctly determined as
R. cicatricata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The descriptions of R. cicatricata by Kürcher & Seibt (1994) and Galli (1996) include
characters observed on the type material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Besides the type specimen of this species, similar characters were found in the speci-
men of R. barlae determined by Romagnesi (and described in Romagnesi, 1967: 700,
701) and two specimens from Greenland deposited in herbarium C. AII of the collections
examined were collected on silicate soil in association with Quercus or Betula species.
This association may be an important factor in the occurrence of this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula citrinocincta Reumaux in Reumaux et al., Russules rares ou méconnues
(1996) 282.#Nomenclature*]

[@Russula citrinocincta is characterised by a pale spore-print (Ic according to Romag-
nesi, 1967) and flesh in the cortex of stipe turning lemon-greenish. It was found in wet
places under Carpinus, mixed or not with Betula. According to the observations on
the type specimen of R. citrinocincta, inflated elements of generative hyphae at the
centre of the pileipellis are very sparse (approximately 10% of the total); the spores are
larger (8-10.5 x 7-8 µm) with isolated, dense, short spines and the terminal elements
of generative hyphae on the margin of the pileipellis are mostly subulate, attenuate or
appendiculate. These characters correspond with the type specimen of R. graveolens
(designated by Kärcher, 2000a) and are distinctly different from characters observed
on the material of R. clavipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula cookeiana Reumaux in Reumaux et al., Russules rares ou méconnues (1996)
283.#Nomenclature*]

[@Russula cookeiana grows in deciduous forest and is characterised by a more brown
tinged pileus and relatively small spores with long spines. Reumaux et al. did not men-
tion R. elaeodes in the sense of Romagnesi, in this respect, a species very similar to
their description of R. cookeiana. According to the observations on the type material of
R. cookeiana by Karcher (1997) the spores are 7-8.5 x 6.5—7.5 µm, spines 1—1.5 µm
long and the terminal elements of the generative hyphae in the pileipellis are cylindrical
and narrow (3—4 µm wide). This points very clearly towards the microscopic details
observed in the type of R. schaefferi. Despite this, Kürcher (1997) distinguished R.
cookeiana from R. schaefferi on account of the brownish-yellow to ochraceous-yellow
pileus and sparser line connections on the spores. Type studies show that R. cookeiana#Misc-exposition*]
[@404 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@and R. schaefferi have a similar structure of the pileipellis: the terminal elements of the
generative hyphae at the margin of the pileipellis are never appendiculate and mostly
clavate or cylindrical with obtuse tips, and the terminal elements at the centre are cy-
lindrical and not inflated. Both names therefore probably represent one and the same
species, which is different from R. clavipes. If further studies prove that both species are
indeed conspecific, the correct name will be, according to Art. 11.3 of the Code, Russula
schaefferi, since this was published in March 1996, and the monograph of Reumaux et
al. in June of the same year.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula duportii W. Phillips in Phillips & Plowright, Grevillea 13 (1884) 48-54.#Nomenclature*]

[@Russula duportii is another poorly known taxon in the group concerned. The original
description by Phillips & Plowright (1884) bears a character, which is typical for Rus-
sula sect. Xerampelinae “flesh turns reddish brown when cut and the odour is that of the
common crab”. However, the position of this species in section Xerampelinae is uncer-
tain, because the characters “gills white, rounded behind, broad and distant” are more
typical for R. vesca Fr. and related taxa. Accordingly, Massee (1893) treated R. dupor-
tii as a variety of R. vesca and Singer (1926) treated R. vesca sensu Massee as a variety of
R. duportii, so it seems that R. duportii in the sense of both authors is not a member of
Russula sect. Xerampelinae. Cooke (18892, 1889b), Smith (1908) and Rea (1922) also
mention R. duportii, but their descriptions of this species refer to the original diagnosis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Melzer & Zvára (1927) were the first who associated R. duportii clearly with R. xeram-
pelina, although later Zvára (1931) synonymised R. duportii with R. amoena Quél.
Singer (1932) also modified his previous concept of R. duportii (sec above) and treated
it as taxon related to R. xerampelina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@While Melzer & Zvára (1927) and Singer (1932) tried to classify R. duportii within
the Xerampelinae on the basis of the original description, Blum (1961) described
R. duportii on the basis of his own collections. Blum reduced it to variety of R. xeram-
pelina and his description is different from the protologue: "the dominant colour of the
pileus cuticle is green-yellow, becoming more reddish with age, rarely lemon-yellow
with lilac spots and lamellae are pale cream”. Blum claimed that his collections ‘exactly
represented’ pl. 1042A by Cooke (1889b). The Cooke illustration has greenish tones on
the margin of the pileus cuticle according to my observations, but the differences from
the original diagnosis (which does not mention greenish tones) could be caused by a
shift of the bluish tones to greenish. The combination R. xerampelina var. duportii was
invalidly published by Blum (1961, 1962), because it lacks a reference to its basionym
(according to Art. 33.2 of the Code).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Reumaux et al., (1996) followed the concept of Blum and described R. duportii as
à taxon in R. sect. Xerampelinae with olivaceous, ochraceous and reddish-brown tints
on the pileus cuticle. The terminal elements of generative hyphae (Reumaux et al.,
1996, fig. R114, p. 218) are described as cylindrical, the spines of spores are short and
the only collection of Reumaux was found in association with Quercus, so this species
in the sense of Reumaux et al. perhaps comes close to R. graveolens. Accordingly, my
observation on the type of R. duportii f. spinulosospora Reumaux (new taxon published
in Reumaux et al., 1996) corresponds with the type material of R. graveolens (see dis-
cussion on R. citrinocincta).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Adamétik: Russula clavipes and related taxa 405#Page-header*]

[@Karcher (2000a) designated a collection of Blum's as neotype of R. duportii. In
the determination key to the species of Russula sect. Xerampelinae Karcher (2000b)
distinguished R. duportii from R. cicatricata by the colour of the pileus, which is, ac-
cording to him, reddish-purple to vinaceous-purple at first with discoloured centre, and
then often completely discolouring to ochraceus-yellow. Kärcher (2000a) mentioned
also the resemblance of microscopic characters to R. faginea, but R. duportii differs on
account of its sparser inflated terminal elements in the pileipellis, and wider and longer
elements of the pileocystidia. The present author does not consider the determining
characters of R. duportii indicated by Karcher reliable for a specific status of this
taxon, since these characters vary among fruit-bodies of one collection. According
to the observations on the neotype the terminal elements of the generative hyphae at
the margin of the pileipellis are often inflated and the terminal elements at the centre
mostly cylindrical reaching 6 µm only rarely (not more than 5%). Spores have relatively
long and moderately distant spines. This character corresponds to the type specimen of
R. brevis, which is probably another separate taxon similar to R. graveolens and
distinctly different from R. clavipes.#Misc-exposition*]

brief and the illustration shows no specific characters. The description gives no clue

[@Bon (1988) treated R. fusca as a species with rusty brown pileus (also with olivaceous
tinges at centre) growing under Quercus species. He described similar spores and hyphal
elements in the pileipellis as in R. cicatricata, so the only differentiating character seems
to be the browner pileus. Therefore R. fusca in the sense of Bon as a separate taxon is
not accepted here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula fuscoochracea R. Schulz in Michael & R. Schulz, Führer für Pilzekunde, Vol.
2. (1926) pl. 241 [nom. illeg.].#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula fuscoochracea is an illegitimate name, because it is a later homonym of
R. fuscoochracea Velen. (Velenovsky, 1920). Russula fuscoochracea Velen. is not a
member of Russula sect. Xerampelinae. Schulz described R. fuscoochracea as a species
with a pileus that is brown, in the centre darker chestnut-brown to black-brown, finally
tinged olivaceous, and a stipe that is white to brownish often with pinkish spots, growing
in mountainous forests from June—November. All these characters are similar to those
of R. clavipes, but there is also similarity with R. favrei (for a detailed description of
R. favrei see Adamcík, 2002).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Reumaux et al. (1996) and Karcher (2000a, 2000b) treat R. fuscoochracea R. Schulz
as a species of coniferous forest different from R. clavipes. The concept of R. fuscoochra-
cea presented by these authors is based on characters which are considered inappropriate
(sce delimitation of R clavipes). Also the description and photo of R. xerampelina var.
fuscoochracea (R.S. Schulz) ined. by Galli (1996) represents typical R. c/avipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula graveolens Romell in Britzelm., Hymen. Südb. (1986) 68-69.#Nomenclature*]

[@In this paper Romagnesi's concept (Romagnesi, 1967) of R. graveolens is accepted
as a species with a typically brownish, vinaceous, purple and greenish pileus, attenu-
ated terminal elements of the generative hyphae, and spores with low ornamentation.
The concept of R. graveolens by Romagnesi is based on one specimen, which Kürcher
(20002) designated as epitype of this species. Some fruit-bodies of R. graveolens have
been observed with an olivaceous pileus completely lacking red, purple or violet tinges,
in association with normally coloured fruit-bodies with purple and vinaceous-brown
tinges. Such aberrantly coloured fruit-bodies of R. graveolens could easily be wrongly
determined as one of the species described above. However, R. graveolens and simi-
lar taxa, which have been collected under Quercus (or Tilia and Carpinus), have one
conjunctive character, which is essentially different from R. clavipes, viz. the terminal
elements of the generative hyphae at the centre of the pileus are almost never inflated
(wider than 6 µm). This has been verified by the study of type material of several spe-
cies from the group of R. graveolens described by Romagnesi (namely R. graveolens,
R. amoenoides Romagn., R. eilvescens Romagn. ex Bon, R. gracilipes Romagn., nom.
inval., R. cretata Romagn. ex Reumaux, R. brevis).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula ochracea Pers., Syn. meth. fung. (1801) 443.#Nomenclature*]

[@In its original concept, R. ochracea Pers. is probably not a species from sect. Xer-
ampelinae, but modification of the original concept by several later authors caused, for
example, Blum (1961, 1962) to treat it as variety of R. xerampelina. Persoon (1801)
characterised it as a species with yellow pileus cuticle, ochraceous lamellae and white
stipe. Von Albertini (1805) published the name *Russula ochracea BB unicolor’, a
new taxon at the rank of variety (according to Art. 35.4 of the Code) with ochraceous
colour on all parts of the fruit-body. Fries (1838) interpreted R. ochracea according
to the variety of Von Albertini, adding the ochraceous colour of the flesh. At the same
time, Fries excluded the original concept of R. ochracea from his description, stating
"Ag. ochraceus P.? potius est n. 42. Variat stipite albo et, ut-omnes, pileo sicco!" (A.
ochraceus P. is under n. 42. — R. chamaeleontina, it differs by a white stipe and dry
pileus). Thus, according to Art. 48.1 of the Code, Fries (1838) published a new name,
R. ochracea Fr. which must be considered a later homonym of R. ochracea Pers. Later
authors such as Cooke (1889a) and Blum (1961, 1962) followed Fries’ concept of the
species. Modification of the original concept by Fries later caused him to identify this
species as a member of sect. Xerampelinae. The original concept of this name is dubi-
ous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula olivascens (Pers.) Fr., Epicr. (1861) 361.#Nomenclature*]

[@Zvára (1923) introduced the combination R. xerampelina var. olivascens (Fr.) Zvára.
The epithet olivascens does not go back to Fries, as Zvára suggested, but must be at-
tributed to Persoon (1801). Persoon (1801) referred in the description of Agaricus
Russula olivascens to his previous work (Persoon, 1796: 103), where he used, however,
the name R. olivacea. Both descriptions contain exactly the same expressions. Both
epithets *olivacea' and *olivascens' are similar names based on the same type, therefore
we consider it as orthographic variants (Art. 61.2), and the correct name is R. olivacea
Pers. (1796). Also Secretan (1833) already noticed that Persoon used both epithets ‘oli-
vascens' and *olivacea' for the same taxon. Russula olivacea is not a member of sect.
Xerampelineae, thus the name cannot be applied to any taxon of the section.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Original material named by Singer as R. xerampelina var. olivascens preserved in
herbarium W, appeared to be identical with the current concept of R. clavipes. Singer's
interpretation of R. xerampelina var. olivascens (Fr.) Zvára was accepted by Melzer
& Zvára (1927), Schaeffer (1933), Galli (1996) and Kärcher (2000b), although they
probably applied the names to various taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula schaefferi Kärcher, Beitr. Kennt. der Plz. Mitteleuropas 10 (1996) 68-69.#Nomenclature*]

[@Kärcher created the name R. schaefferi for Romagnesi's misidentification of R.
elaeodes. Besides Romagnesi (1967), who listed five collections from France, this
species seems very rare (for example Einhellinger, 1987 indicated only two localities
in Bavaria).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The generative hyphae of the type specimen of R. schaefferi have cylindrical and
narrow terminal elements at the margin as well as at the centre of the pileus (only 3-5
µm wide), which usually have obtuse tips. The spores have longer (1.1—1.7 m) and
sparse spines (3-8 spines in the circle) which are densely connected by line connec-
tions (1—7 connections in a 3 µm diameter circle). Similar terminal elements of the
generative hyphae of the pileipellis are for example found in the type specimen of
R. cookeiana (see above) or collections of R. bruneoalba from Belgium (Walleyn, Gent).
Based on these observations, R. schaefferi is considered different from R. clavipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Slowly but steadily the important work *Fungi of Australia’ is published. The first vol-
ume appeared in two parts and provided an introduction to the series, and consisted of
a collection of review essays on various aspects of Australian mycology. Volume 2 is
the Catalogue and bibliography of Australian fungi and will appear in three parts. The
first part of this volume two was published in 1997, and now finally the second part has
appeared. The Catalogue began as a project to compile information on Australian agarics
and boletes. In the first part several orders of macrofungi were treated, and the present
volume was meant to include the remaining macrofungi. However, the Catalogue has
evolved to cover all groups of fungi, and the present volume 2B now encompasses the
remaining larger Basidiomycota and the large Myxomycota. It may seem a little odd that
lichens are included in the Flora of Australia series, while the non-fungi Myxomycota is
included in the series Fungi of Australia, but, as the authors state, “to some extent it is a
grouping of convenience” and the ‘fungi’ incorporate “all those organisms traditionally
studied by mycologists” and that surely includes Myxomycota.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book contains 14 pages of introduction in which also an overview is given of
which order of fungi will be treated in which volume. Of each of almost 1,400 ac-
cepted species in this volume 2B the authors are given and the publication, synonyms
and a comprehensive list of literature records of the taxon from Australia up to 2000.
Misidentifications have been noted where they have been corrected in publications. The
book is concluded with a 58 pages long list of references and an index of the names of
the taxa used. The 64 coloured plates of high quality on 16 pages give the book a more
attractive appearance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We are all eagerly waiting for the next volumes to appear. The major part of ‘Fungi
of Australia’ will give descriptions of the fungi based on Australian material, distribu-
tion, synonymy, keys for identification, discussion of ecology. It is hoped that the next
volumes will appear a little bit sooner, otherwise we will not see this series finished in
our (and the present authors’) lifetime. Let us hope the financers of this project are able
to raise some more money to get more mycologists working on this important series
about an area we are all fascinated about and know so very little. Without doubt this
book is a must for everybody interested in the region, although the information will
also be made available on-line.#Misc-exposition*]

[@BASIDIOME DEVELOPMENT OF BAEOSPORA MYOSURA
(TRICHOLOMATALES, BASIDIOMYCETES)#Misc-exposition*]

[@H. CLÉMENÇON#Misc-exposition*]

[@Institut d' Ecologie, Université de Lausanne. CH- 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.
E-mail: Heinz.Clémençon@bluewin.ch#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the first time, the primordial development of a species of Baeospora is described
and found to be metablematic, but the spurious partial veil vanishes in mature speci-
mens. The pubescence of the mature stipe is a cauloblema. Although the pileus is
described as dry in fully grown fruit-bodies, some young basidiomes have a locally
slightly gelatinous pileipellis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species of the small agaricoid genus Baeospora Singer "are completely known
except for the development of the carpophores" (Singer, 1986), a statement confirmed by
Watling & Turnbull (1998) and Vellinga (1999), and still true in December 2001 when
I came across a plentiful crop of young basidiomes of Baeospora myosura (Fr.: Fr.)
Singer in all phases of development, from the young nodulus to the mature carpophore,
growing on a dead cone of Picea excelsa. The cone was inspected under a stereo-
microscope, and fragments of the cone with attached primordia were fixed, dehydrated,
embedded and sectioned for the study of fruit-body development.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL. AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Excised cone fragments bearing the fungus were fixed by immersion in a solution of
0.9% formaldehyde and 1.259€ glutaraldehyde in a 0.05 M sodium cacodylate buffer
of pH 6.9. No vacuum was applied, and the material was fixed for 24-48 hours at a
room temperature of about 20°C. Some material floated on the solution, but this did not
reduce the quality of the fixation, as the aldehyde gasses penetrated into the fungi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fixed material was transferred directly to ice-cold 2-methoxy-ethanol (methyl
cellosolve) without intermediate steps, and carried over ethanol and propanol into bu-
tanol, according to the procedure outlined by Feder & O'Brien (1968). For embedding,
a mixture of 7 g glycol methacrylate and 3 g butyl methacrylate, complemented with
3 drops of terpineol per ml of methacrylate mixture, activated with 0.356 benzoyl per-
oxide and promoted with 0.04% N, N-dimethyl aniline was used. After polymerisation
at room temperature for 12—16 hours, the blocks were cured at 60—65°C for another
10-12 hours.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microtome sections, usually 4—6 jem thick, were stretched on a drop of terpineol-
saturated distilled water at room temperature and affixed to the glass slide by drying
the preparations on a hot bench of about 70°C. The dry sections had to be baked onto
the glass for at least 2 hours at 115—120°C to prevent formation of blisters during stain-
ing. Most sections were stained with aluminium zirconium haematoxylin at 38-40°C,#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The smallest stage observed is a nodulus about 125 µm high and 85 µm in diameter
(Fig. 1). It consists entirely of irregularly interwoven hyphae. The middle part is slightly less
dense than the base and the top. At this stage no metablema (Clémençon, 1997) is present.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The next stage has the form of an elongate ellipsoid about 115 µm wide and 305 µm
high (Fig. 2). The basal part is a tightly woven nodulus supporting a primordial shaft
consisting of upward growing slightly interwoven hyphae. In the nodulus the hyphae
are irregularly arranged and about 2.5—4.5 µm wide; in the centre of the shaft they are
subregular and 1.5—4 µm wide; and in the top they are again irregularly arranged, but
they measure only about 1.5—2.5 µm. At the sides, a few hyphae grow away from the
main body announcing the future metablema. As the primordia develop on the inner
side of a scale of the Picea cone, the primordial shaft is not geotropically upright, but
it grows into the space between two scales.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 3 shows a slightly larger developmental stage covered with a loose metablema
and topped by an early pileus initial. The diameter of the hyphae diminishes from 2—5.5
jam in the nodulus at the base of the primordium to about 1.5—2.5 µm in the young
pileus. There is no trace of a prehymenial palisade.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the pileus rudiment enlarges, a small, irregular prehymenial palisade develops
between the pileus edge and the stipe (Fig. 4c, d), but it does not always circle the whole
circumference of the primordium. The expansion of the pileus separates the meta-
blema into two parts that can be called pileoblema and cauloblema (Clémençon, 1997).
The prehymenial palisade initial is not covered by a metablema, but some hyphae of
the pileoblema may locally grow below the pileus edge (Fig. 4c). In the young pileus
the hyphae are irregularly and tightly interwoven and are only about 1—3.5 µm thick,
but in the basal part of the primordium they now measure up to 6 µm in diameter (Fig.
4e). The middle part of the primordium is the very short stipe initial. Its hyphae forma
more or less irregular context with only a slight longitudinal tendency.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 5 shows the upper part of a primordium about 450 jam high. In the lower part of
the stipe, a few hyphae inflate conspicuously, announcing the formation of the spindle-
shaped physalohyphae characteristic of the sarcodimitic stipe context of the mature
basidiome (Vellinga, 1999). As the pileus grows and expands laterally, the prehymenial
palisade becomes more conspicuous. The cauloblema now grows upwards towards the
pileus edge and may locally bridge the gap between the pileus and the stipe, thus form-
ing a very scant partial veil. This veil remains very thin and shows many gaps where the
prehymenial palisade remains naked. The Figs. 6a—d show two 'cauloblematic bridges"
from the same primordium.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Clémençon: Basidiome development of Baeospora myosura 413#Page-header*]

[@The scant ‘cauloblematic bridges’ persist for some time, but they never form a com-
plete partial veil. In another primordium of about the same size, the metablema does not
bridge the gap between stipe and pileus margin at any point, although the pileoblema
and the cauloblema are well-developed (Fig. 7). In both primordia the prehymenial
palisades are well-formed but still smooth, since no gills are yet formed (Fig. 9).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gills are formed by downward growth of generative hyphae (Fig. 8a, d). The primor-
dial gill trama is subregular, slightly divergent and weakly bidirectional by the presence
of a few hyphae roughly parallel to the gill edge. Surprisingly, the pileipellis is gelatinous
at this stage (Fig. 8b, c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conclusion is that B. myosura is exocarpic metablematic with a spurious amphi-
cleistoblema that does not leave any trace in mature fruit-bodies.#Misc-exposition*]

of intertwined hyphae, but shows already a slight plectological differentiation; the centre is less dense

upward growing, subregular hyphae. In the nodulus at the base the hyphae are wider and irregularly
arranged. A few hyphae grow out laterally from the shaft; this is the metablema rudiment. 3. The pileus
initial is formed, but there is no prehymenial palisade yet. The metablema is well-developed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is a concise and rewritten version of the author's ‘Anatomie der Hymeno-
myceten’, published in 1997 by Koeltz Verlag (CH), which, unfortunately, never has
been reviewed in this journal. In almost 500 pages the author leads us through the
exciting world of the anatomy, cytology, and histology of the Hymenomycetes, which
include all major groups of higher basidiomycetes, excluding gasteroid and jelly fungi.
After a short introduction to the Hymenomycetes and their general developmental mor-
phology, the book opens with an elaborate account of the features of the building stone
of a basidiomycete fruit-body: the hypha, followed by a chapter on the mycelium with
all its structures. Further chapters deal with mitospores, basidiospores, cystidia sensu
lato, pigments and their topography, bulbils, sclerotia and pseudosclerotia, basidiome
types, and developmental characters of the fruit-bodies. The last chapter is devoted to
the associations of Hymenomycetes with other organisms. Care is taken of a consistent
terminology. The author does not hesitate to make statements as to the correct use of
terms and definitions. The text, which is written in a concise and clear style, is illustrated
with a great number of high quality figures and diagrams, with clear indication of the
source and often improved with help of digital techniques. With this publication the
author created a standard work that will be a valuable tool and source of information for
several generations of mycologist to come. Ernest and Valerie Emmett, who assisted the
author in the preparation of this book, did a wonderful job by using an easy to understand
language and style. Every mycologist should have this book on the shelf.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHLOROGASTER DIPTEROCARPI
A new peristomate gasteroid taxon of the Sclerodermataceae#Misc-exposition*]

[@THOMAS LÆSSØE! & LEO M. JALINK?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chlorogaster dipterocarpi, a striking gasteroid fungus, collected in a dipterocarp
forest in Sabah, is described here as new. It is characterized by epigeous, slenderly
pyriform basidiomes with a dark green exoperidium consisting of dehiscent, coni-
cal warts and a pale green circular peristome, large, dark brown spores with crested
ornamentation and a thin-walled hyaline paracapillitium. It clearly belongs to the
Sclerodermataceae, but the unusual combination of characters demands for a new
genus. A similar but probably unripe fungus from Papua New Guinea might represent
à second species belonging to this new genus.#Abstract*]

[@During mycological fieldwork by the first author in eastern Sabah, Borneo (Malaysia) in
1999 a striking dark green gasteromycete was found twice in lowland dipterocarp for-
est near the Danum Valley Field Centre. Most obvious is the dark green overall colour,
combined with prominent dehiscent conical warts (almost as in Lycoperdon perlatum
Pers.: Pers.) and a pale green, very distinct annular peristome with a simple aperture.
Microscopically the huge, strongly crested-spinulose, dark spores stand out. On account
of the morphological structures the taxon belongs to the Sclerodermataceae, but, despite
an extensive literature search, no specific or generic name could be found. A picture
was published in the journal Svampe (Lzessóe, 1999) in order to attract attention, and
several experts in tropical and/or gasteroid fungi have been contacted, but in vain. We
therefore conclude that this find represents an undescribed genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chlorogaster belongs to the family Sclerodermataceae on account of the structure of
the immature gleba, the presence of paracapillitium, the morphology of the spores and
the tough peridium. The current edition of the Dictionary of Fungi (Kirk et al., 2001)
accepts the Sclerodermataceae within Boletales and includes besides Scleroderma also
Pisolithus, Calostoma, Astraeus, Favillea, Horakiella and Tremellogaster. Within this
family Chlorogaster is (based on micro- and macromorphology) most closely related to
Scleroderma, from which it differs in the presence of a peristome, the more differentiated
structure of the peridium (even in comparison to the few Scleroderma species with a
marked peridial differentiation as Scleroderma echinatum, S. tenerum and S. leptopo-
dium (Petri, 1900; Demoulin & Dring. 1975; Guzman & Ovrebo, 2000)), the occur-
rence of bright green and blue pigments and the strong and complex ornamentation of
the spores. None of the known species of Scleroderma forms a peristome (Guzmán,
1970, 1971).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Extensive efforts by Hibbett & Binder to obtain usable DNA through PCR by
SDS extraction, CTAB extraction, gel purification, ethanol precipitation, geneclean
and Qiagen DNeasy extraction kit; and also at various temperatures, with touchdown
methods, gradient ramping methods, high magnesium, low magnesium, did not succeed.
Although we failed to obtain molecular data it is likely that Chlorogaster belongs in the
Calostoma! Pisolithus/ Scleroderma lineage (Hughey et al., 2000) within the Boletales
clade (Hibbett et al., 1997) or Sclerodermatineae (Binder & Bresinsky, 2002). The green
pigmentation would indicate a possible linkage with Pisolithus from which it differs in
the absence of peridioles. A well-formed peristome is also found in Calostoma which,
however, in other respects seems more distantly related to Chlorogaster. Tremellogaster,
another genus considered to be closely related to Scleroderma (Guzman, 1971), is char-
acterized by globose, sessile basidiomes with a thick and strongly gelatinous peridium
(Fischer, 1924). Veligaster, which is considered synonymous with Scleroderma by many
authors (Demoulin & Dring, 1975; Sims et al., 1995), has pseudostipitate basidiomes
like Chlorogaster but differs in having a different peridium structure with a subgelati-
nous exoperidium (Guzmán, 1969; Guzmán & Tapia, 1995). Veligaster columnaris is
nested within Scleroderma in the molecular phylogenetic study by Binder & Bresinsky
(2002). Another genus included in the Sclerodermataceae is Horakiella (Castellano &
Trappe, 1992), which is a hypogeous genus with more or less globose basidiomes with
an undifferentiated peridium and pale brown to hyaline spores with a low reticulate
ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]
[@426 PERSOONIA — Vol. 18, Part 3, 2004#Page-header*]

[@In 1997 a blackish gasteromycete, which shows great resemblance to the Bornean
material, was collected in Papua New Guinea by A. Verbeken. This material was studied
by Derous and Demoulin and a short description with line drawings of the microscopical
details is given by Derous (2000), who suggested that it might be a new genus, related
to the collection depicted by Lzessee (1999). They refrained from formally describing
it as a new species since all basidiomes were still unopened and therefore probably not
mature. The material was carefully re-examined by Jalink and indeed there is no trace
of an aperture nor peristome. The gross morphology and the striking similarity in size
and ornamentation of the spores, the lack of a true capillitium and both the macroscop-
ical and microscopical details of the peridium indicate that the New Guinean collection
might represent a second species belonging to Chlorogaster. However, differences in
other characters summarized in Table I indicate that the Papuan collection is certainly
not conspecific with Chlorogaster dipterocarpi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since it is not known whether the species from Papua New Guinea will develop a
peristome or not, the taxonomic position of this species remains uncertain. It is still
possible that the species from Papua New Guinea will develop a peristome at maturity.
Apparently the peristome is formed in one of the last stages of the maturation of the
basidiome since in the young specimens of Chlorogaster dipterocarpi there is no trace
of a peristome either.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Scleroderma and Pisolithus are considered to be ectotrophic. Miller & Miller (1988)
have claimed species of Calostoma to be saprotrophic — a statement that should be tested.
We strongly suspect Chlorogaster and, indeed, Calostoma spp. to be ectotrophic as well.
This further illustrates the predicted and already documented richness of ectotrophs
within the dipterocarp forest type in South-East Asia (Lee, 1990; Watling, 1994; Watling
& Lee, 1995; Sims et al., 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mycorrhizal partner of Chlorogaster could well be a dipterocarp. Most genera of
the Dipterocarpaceae are known to form ectomycorrhizal associations (Lee, 1990). In
the field mycorrhizal connections have been observed between dipterocarps and basidio-
mata of Scleroderma sinnamariense (Watling, 1994; Sims et al., 1997) and Pisolithus
aurantioscabrosus (Watling et al., 1995). Several other Sclerodermatales, such as Piso-
lithus abditus, Scleroderma columnare, S. dyctiosporum, S. echinatum, S. leptopodium,
S. verrucosum and Astraeus hygrometicus, are known from dipterocarp forests and
members of the Sclerodermatales can be rather common in these forests (Rifai, 1987;
Smits, 1994; Watling & Lee, 1995; Sims et al., 1997, 1999; Watling et al., 1999; Binder
& Bresinsky, 2002; Kanchanaprayudh et al., 2003).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although exciting it is not surprising to find such a distinctive new genus in the
tropical rain forest. As for example Guzmán & Ovrebo (2000) already noted: "our
knowledge of the biodiversity [fungi] of all regions, not just the tropics, remains poorly
documented".#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the scope of a revision of the genus Agrocybe for Flora agaricina neerlandica,
three new taxa of Agrocybe sect. Pediadae are described. Agrocybe ochracea spec.

[@Also this taxon was discovered in an earlier stage of the revision of Agrocybe for
the Netherlands (Nauta, 1987), but unfortunately only one collection was available.
Much later another collection was found among voucher specimens of Agrocybe col-
lected by B.M. Spooner in 1996 on the Azores, which were sent for identification. This
second collection finally enabled comparison with other taxa and formal description
of this taxon. Since then, this species has been found on a few more locations in the
Netherlands. It seems that the percentage of 2-spored basidia can be much higher than
originally thought. Striking characters are the thick gelatinous pileipellis covering and
the presence of pleurocystidia differing in shape or size from the cheilocystida. These
pleurocystidia are often quite conspicuous, due to the slightly thickened walls and the
often present mucilaginous covering of the head.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This taxon may be the same as A. temulenta (Fr.) Singer in the sense of Watling
(1982), differing from A. semiorbicularis according to Watling by the deeper coloured
cap. It is, however, difficult to judge from the description exactly what species he had
in mind. In addition the presence of veil is mentioned as a distinguishing character
in the description of A. temulenta, in contrast to A. semiorbicularis which lacks all
veil (Watling, 1982: 22). In the key, however, both species are set apart together with
A. subpediades by the lack of all traces of veil (Watling, 1982: 11, step 14 x). Although
the presence of pleurocystidia with A. temulenta is mentioned in the description, no
details are given about their size and shape, which is one of the most distinguishing
characters of the above described taxon. Singer (1936: 167) had a different interpreta-
tion of this species: the characteristic cystidia with the finger-like projections and the
fruit-bodies with a root connected to a sclerotium partly match with what is nowadays
called A. arvalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both interpretations are partly in contrast with the original description of Fries (1821:
268) which describes A. remulentus with a rusty brown substriate cap and a whitish stipe
which becomes brownish. Since there is also no original material of A. temulenta avail-
able, this name may best be considered as ambiguous, and the above described taxon
is in need of a new name.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nauta: Notulae F.A. N. XLIII — Notes on Agrocybe 433#Page-header*]

[@This taxon was recently discovered during an excursion of the Netherlands' Myco-
logical Society. An area was visited in the Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen where
grazing cows are used as a method of nature management. This management has been
carried out since 1985 and many interesting species of fungi have already been found,
also on dung, e.g. Panaeolus speciosus P. D. Orton. It was this species the participants
were looking for, and the Agrocybe on dung looked superficially like a slightly aberrant
A. pediades. Although A. pediades is a very variable species (Nauta, in press b), occur-
ring on various substrates, this particular collection was different, and remarkable for
its presence of veil at the cap margin. Careful investigation of the literature revealed
the existence of A. fimicola (Speg.) Singer, a species originally described from dung
in Argentina by Spegazzini (1899). Singer (1950) discovered the species among col-
lections from Spegazzini and transferred it to Agrocybe. Because the species did not
differ microscopically from A. pediades var. pediades, except for the consistently large
spores, it is here considered a variety. Although it was found only on one location, the
distribution is probably wider, it may easily be overlooked.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since the publication of the first edition of this book, important developments in bio-
technology and mushroom production made a new, revised version necessary. As it is
written for the mushroom industry, it emphasizes on nutritional, medical, and cultivating
aspects of edible and medicinal fungi. A short introduction deals with a definition of
fungi and the world of fungi, including edible and poisonous species, and the relation
between fungi and man. Two chapters deal with edible and medicinal fungi respectively.
And an overview is given of the biology of fungi. Chapters 5-11 deal with the various
aspects of cultivation of fungi: substrate and mycelial growth, sexuality and genetics,
mushroom formation in culture and the effects of genetic factors and breeding, pests,
culture preservation and world production of edible mushrooms. Chapters 12-21 deal
with the various important cultivated mushrooms, such as Agaricus bisporus, Lentinula
edodes, Volvariella, Pleurotus, Tremella, and others. The final chapter gives an over-
view of technology and mushrooms. As such it forms a comprehensive and up-to-date
source of information for all interested in edible and medicinal mushrooms and their
cultivation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudobaeospora lavendulamellata is described as new. It has been collected several
times in Kerala, India. The species is characterised by a combination of relatively stout
basidiocarps with violaceous colours, spore-size and the structure of the pileipellis,
being a trichodermium turning pale bluish green in KOH.#Abstract*]

[@During their study of agarics in Kerala the two last-named authors came across a re-
markable white-spored species with predominantly violaceous basidiocarps. Initially
they regarded it as an undescribed species of the genus Hygrocybe (Fr.) P. Kumm.
During our combined revision of Hygrocybe in Kerala (Leelavathy et al., in press) the
first author concluded that the collections did not belong to Hygrocybe in view of the
crowded and thin lamellae, the short basidia and the presence of true cheilocystidia.
Instead, they appear to belong to the little known genus Pseudobaeospora Singer, in
particular because of the thick-walled, dextrinoid spores when mature. No description
could be found in literature, matching the collections from Kerala. Consequently it is
described here as a new species, Pseudobaeospora lavendulamellata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within Pseudobaeospora this species is characterised by the combination of relatively
large basidiocarps with beautiful, violet colours, the presence of cheilocystidia and the
structure of the pileipellis being a trichoderm, discolouring rather pale bluish green in
KOH. Variation in KOH-reaction on the pileipellis was described by Bas (2002) as a
useful diagnostic character for species recognition within this genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of the important generic characters of Pseudobaeospora is that the spores
become thick-walled and dextrinoid when mature (Bas, 2002, 2003). In our material
no thick-walled spores were found in the preparations of lamellae and therefore the
dextrinoid reaction was overlooked at first. However, on the surface of the pileus some
thick-walled, dextrinoid spores were found indeed, but also here the large majority of
spores were thin-walled and non-dextrinoid. Also the spores discoloured bluish green
in KOH, a feature not noticed by Bas (2002) in European species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently, Bas (2002, 2003) published a revision of Pseudobaeospora in Europe. In
his key he distinguished a group of species with the pileipellis “discolouring red, blue,
green or yellow-green in KOH” and a group with the “pileipellis not discolouring or
becoming pale yellowish, yellowish-brownish, reddish-brownish or greyish-greenish
in KOH". In P. lavendulamellata the pileipellis turns rather pale bluish green, so that
its position in one of these groups is disputable. In the group with green pileipellis in
KOH our species seems to come closest to P. pyrifera Bas & L.G. Krieglst., originally
described from Germany. That species also combines relatively sturdy basidiocarps with
violaceous colours and the presence of cheilocystidia, but it differs in smaller, globose
spores (2.8-3.7 x 2.6-3.5 µm), broadly clavate cheilocystidia (10-30 x 4.0-13 µm)
and the structure of the pileipellis with chains of inflated cells, 10-35(-42) x 6.0-17
µm (Bas & Krieglsteiner, 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the group of species with non-discolouring pileipellis P. lavendulamellata comes
closest to P. jamonii Bas, Lalli & Lonati, originally described from Italy. That species
has also versiform cheilocystidia and spores about 3.0— 4.0 µm long, but the basidiocarps
are smaller (pileus 5-15(-25) mm, stipe 15-25(-40) x 1-2 mm) with more reddish
purplish colours, the spores are subglobose (Q — 1.05-1.20(-1.30), Q av. 2 1.10-1.15)
and the pileipellis is a cutis (Bas et al., 2002; Bas, 2003).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Manfred Enderle is a well-known German mycologist, specialized in the taxonomy
of Agarics. His numerous publications deal with various genera, with an emphasis on
Psathyrella and Conocybe. Floristics have his warm interest as well. The present book
may be considered his magnum opus, and gives an overview of long-term observation
of the macrofungi in the region of Ulm in southern Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria,
southern Germany. The introduction gives a short overview of the life cycle of fungi,
and the methods to study and collect them, as well as an introduction into the Ulmer
region with its vegetation and climate. The main part of the book, however, is devoted
to an extensive overview of all of the about 2,800 taxa known from the area, arranged
according to the families, with correct name and list of localities. Rare and critical spe-
cies are often fully described and illustrated in line-drawing and often excellent coloured
photographs. Especially these form a nice source of information, which makes the book
interesting also for those who do not live in the Ulmer region. At the back of this book
the reader will find about 30 pages with black-and-white photographs of mycological
acquaintances of the author, including several famous mycologists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is the third of this series, and deals with the tribe Agariceae of the family
Agaricaceae. The first one dealt with Cyanoprocaryotes and algae, the second with
soil microfungi, all of Israel. Although the higher basidiomycetes of Israel have been
investigated and a number of publications has appeared, the knowledge of the mycota
of Israel is far from complete. This work contributes to the knowledge of at least part of
the higher basidiomycetes. The book starts with an introduction of 6 pages in which the
outline of the book is given and the backgrounds of the family Agaricaceae. The chapter
“Main natural features of Israel” gives details on the geology, climate and vegetation.
The main part of the book is the systematic part, which begins with an outline of the
family, and an overview of the used characters, including an essay on morphometric
characters of the basidia and characters of pigments and proteins, together with elaborate
comments on their use in unravelling the taxonomy of the family. The chapter also gives
an overview of the work done by others using molecular data. The last c. 120 pages are
filled with a treatment of the tribe Agariceae, with a key to the 4 genera, and of cach
genus the species are listed. Of each species a comprehensive synonymy with literature
references, iconography, an extensive description, distribution, specimens examined
and ecology is given. Of many species line drawings are depicted, and sometimes a
SEM photograph is given, as well as a world-distribution map. Unfortunately no keys
to the species are provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although this book is a welcome contribution to the knowledge of macrofungi in
Israel, some critical remarks need to be made. Numerous are the orthographical errors
in the book, unfortunately, and the use of English could use some clarification. Also
the family delimitation is rather curious: genera like Cystoderma, Squamanita and
Pseudobaeospora are included, really a very classic approach which is contradicted by
morphological characters as well as molecular research. The reasons for this dissenting
view are not very strong. The author disagrees in this book with the new genus A//opsal-
liota to accommodate A. geesterani, apparently without having read all the arguments.
However, molecular research underlines the considered decision to create a new genus.
Also, considering the description and drawings of A. geesterani in this book, the find
in Israel may well belong to another (perhaps new) species of sect. Duploannulatae.
Considering the drawings, the presence of clamps in many of the pileal cuticle draw-
ings in the genus Agaricus is surprising, since the genus is known for its absence of
clamps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nevertheless, this book serves the purpose it was written for, to add to the knowledge
of basidiomycetes in Israel, and as such it serves this purpose well.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Alterra. Tree Doctor. Diagnosis of diseases of forest and ornamental trees. CD-Rom
(Alterra, Wageningen, info.alterra@wur.nl, 2001.) Price: EUR 75.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This CD-Rom is meant for people who manage trees and are confronted with diseases
and plagues. It comprises data of 196 tree species on all kinds of attacks which kill
or devalue a tree or scrub. It contains data on harm by insects (242 species), infective
diseases (112 species, among which macro- and microfungi), mammals (3) and abiotic
factors like drought or damage by herbicides (7). All diseases and plagues are provided
with illustrations of the symptoms, elaborate descriptions of the species which causes
it, including lifecycle, degree of harm, and, if relevant, what can be done against it. Also
included are data about useful value of trees, a glossary, a bibliography and a search
engine. It does not pretend to be a complete encyclopedia of tree species and their
diseases, but gives information about the most common trees and harmful factors (450)
that occur in the four countries that participated in this project: the Netherlands, France,
Italy and Great Britain. The CD-Rom has therefore appeared in four languages.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Dutch version is strangely enough the most comprehensive one, also, the English
version could use some improvement by a native speaker. Of each organism the scientific
name is given, the vernacular name, taxonomical details, host plants, symptoms, possible
confusion with other symptoms, harm, distribution and frequency. The symptoms and
their cause are illustrated with 1—3 colour photographs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are in principle two ways of reaching a result: the first is by choosing the spe-
cies of tree, successively the part of the plant which is infected, and the symptoms, the
second entrance is to choose directly for the organism or symptom. The pictures of the
infected parts are a bit simple and could easily be improved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although this CD-Rom is developed for use by nature managers and not for profes-
sional mycologists, it is always interesting to see what fungi are treated in a programme
like this. Most of the 112 infective diseases concern fungi, and in that part we are the
most interested. In general their pictures are not of good quality, and that is a pity, since
they are easy-to-obtain pictures of rather commonly occurring species. Some pictures
are even wrong: one of the photographs of Heterobasidion annosum refers to Gano-
derma adspersum! Also the choice of species is rather limited. While a medium like a
CD is suitable for storing an enormous lot of information without too much costs, some
important species are lacking. like Heterobasidion annosum and Fomitopsis pinicola.
Although the CD-Rom is not meant as an encyclopedia, a lot more information could
have been given on different species. And the way to find what species has caused the
symptom one is looking at seems a bit complicated, by clicking on pictures. It is likely
that at least the bracketfungi will sometimes be wrongly identified, but since the main
protection of trees against those fungi is keeping the tree in good condition and prevent
mechanical damage, that should not be a problem. A missed opportunity is the lack of
microscopical characters. In this way often no certain identification can be made. The
orthographic errors are a bit annoying.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In summary this CD-Rom is interesting, but mostly as a reference book, and it remains
to be seen whether this programme is really helpful for managers of trees. It needs to
be expanded and updated, and nicer photographs are needed, but a good start is made
with it.#Misc-exposition*]

well as a Windows environment, and has a version in English and Danish.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An exciting-to-use CD-Rom it seems, but unfortunately the first try did not succeed
at all. QuickTime needs to be installed on your PC if one wants to run MycoKey version
1.0. Fortunately there is a new version of MycoKey, version 1.1, downloadable from
the website (www.mycokey.com). The programme starts with an introduction screen
where one can find background information about Mycokey. And, even more important,
how the programme works. First one has to decide to use the easy or the full version.
The easy version, as the authors state, "gives the unexperienced mushroom collector a
soft start with the most common genera and rather easy characters, and is suitable for
children from 10 years and up". The full version serves the advanced student and the
professional mycologist with the full character set of more than one thousand characters,
lots of illustrations and lots of references to revisions, fungas, keys, etc. A hurried user
could have some difficulties finding which button is what, but pressing the keybutton
for starting the key is more or less logic. After doing this one gets all sorts of questions
to answer, and to the left an indication is given of how many genera are left to decide
from. The authors advise to fill in only those questions one is certain of, which is in
general a good advice. One can check which genera still agree with the character states
by pressing one of the buttons on top, and going back to the exercise of filling in is the
lower right half of the same button. The buttons could do with some more explanatory
labels, now one has to press the question mark button to find out which is which,#Misc-exposition*]

[@All sorts of species were tried to be identified up to generic level with the full ver-
sion, to find out if the programme really works. Unfortunately, the character states are
sometimes not correct: Macrolepiota is classified as having thin-walled spores instead
of thick-walled, an Agaricus with an umbonate cap is impossible according to the pro-
gramme, even though in the description caps can be umbonate, omphaloid genera like
Rickenella and Omphalina, often with a convex, umbilicate cap can not be identified
with that shape of cap, a Pleurotus with a smooth cap can not be identified. Colour
seems to be especially difficult to code: one can choose from a range of colours, but
colours are sometimes wrongly coded for species: Allopsalliota and Agaricus have the
wrong colour of sporedeposit, Myriostoma has the wrong colour of fruitbody, Leccinum
holopus, with its pale colour of the cap can not be identified, the colour of the cap of a
fresh Laccaria amethystea is not available. These failures point us maybe once again
to the fact that genera are often difficult to characterize within macrofungi. Also, the
choice of character states is sometimes a bit limited: the flesh (context of an agaric) can
only be cottony, brittle, tough, hard, waxy or gelatinous, there is no option to choose for
soft without being waxy or gelatinous. Of course, the examples of species which could#Misc-exposition*]
[@Book reviews 443#Page-header*]

[@be correctly identified to genus level were numerous and are not enumerated here. And
the photographs of the several species per genus are without exception of very high
quality! Also pictures are included of genera which are not exactly commonly depicted,
like Episphaeria, Pellidiscus or Campanella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The programme needs in general more evaluation and updating before it will become
a bestseller as an identification programme. But the ingredients are already there: the
nice pictures, and an enormous lot of information on a lot of species and genera. Enough
reason to buy it. But we are eagerly awaiting the next updates and MycoKey 2, which
will contain the discomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]
