[@GYMNOPUS BELTRANIAE, A NEW SPECIES OF
SECTION VESTIPEDES (AGARICALES) FROM THE
CANARY ISLANDS (SPAIN)#Misc-exposition*]
[@Á. BAÑARES 1, V. ANTONÍN 2 & G. MORENO 3#Misc-exposition*]
[@Gymnopus beltraniae, collected on the Canary Islands in ‘monteverde’ forest as well
as mixed monteverde/Canary pine forest, is proposed as a new species belonging
to sect. Vestipedes subsect. Vestipedes. It is compared with species from North and
South America considered to represent the closest taxa in its section.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collecting fungi for an exhibition at the 5th and 16th ‘Jornadas Micológicas’ of Gran
Canaria and Tenerife, respectively, we discovered an interesting Gymnopus species in
mixed monteverde/Canary pine forest as well as in plantations of Pinus radiata D. Don.
Further rich collections were subsequently found in genuine monteverde forest during
collecting trips to Garajonay National Park on the island of La Gomera. ‘Monteverde
forest’ is a form of Mediterranean hard-leaved forest that survives as a relict on the
Canary Islands, following its disappearance from Mediterranean riversides in the course
of glaciations at the end of the Tertiary period.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Based on its morphological features, the new Gymnopus species belongs to sect.
Vestipedes (Fr.) Antonín, Halling & Noordel., close to the G. subnudus/biformis/subfumosa group from North and South America. Following comparison of the Canary
material with types and other collections of American and other species in its section,
we decided to describe Gymnopus beltraniae as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Microscopic features are described from material mounted in Melzer’s reagent and in
Cotton blue. For the basidiospores the following factors are used: E (quotient of length
and width in any one spore) and Q (mean of E‑values). Colour abbreviations follow
Kornerup & Wanscher (1983), and herbarium abbreviations follow Holmgren (2003).#Misc-exposition*]

hairy or velvety stipe which is sometimes longitudinally compressed and grooved and

subsect. Vestipedes (Antonín & Noordeloos, 1997). A photograph has been published
by Dähncke (1998) as Collybia tergina (Fr.) Lundell.#Description*]
[@	 The closest species are those of the G. subnudus/biformis/subfumosus group from
North and South America.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Gymnopus biformis (Peck) Halling (holotype NYS 0354) has less distant lamellae,
a stipe white above and tawny to vinaceous brown toward the base (Halling, 1983,
1997), smaller basidiospores (7.0–8.5 × 3.0–3.5(–4.0) µm), and distinctly coralloid
cheilocystidia. This species has recently also been found in Japan (Miyamoto et al.,
1998).#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Gymnopus subpruinosus (Murrill) Desjardin, Halling & Hemmes (holotype NY)
differs in its non-caespitose carpophores, a broader, striate-rugulose, innately ﬁbrillose
pileus (15–40 mm broad, 20–60 mm according to Dennis, 1951), a pileus colour which
is chestnut-brown to reddish brown at centre, elsewhere medium brown and occasionally tinged purplish brownish, and a smaller stipe measuring 20–50 × 1.0–3.0 mm
(Halling, 1983, 1997). Cheilocystidia are partly similar to G. beltraniae, partly with
distinctly coralloid-diverticulate apex.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Gymnopus subnudus (Ellis ex Peck) Halling (holotype NY) has a rapidly rugulosesulcate pileus, which may be rugulose-undulate at margin, and is cinnamon brown when
fresh, usually fading to cinnamon with age or when dried; it also has a stipe which
is subglabrous above, whitish to greyish pubescent below, appearing glabrous when
wet or water soaked (Halling, 1983, 1997). Microscopically, G. subnudus has larger
basidiospores (9.5–12 × 4.0–5.0 µm) and cheilocystidia which are larger (28–63 ×
5.0–8.5 µm) and differently shaped (subulate, cylindrical or fusoid, sometimes apically
coralloid). Not having the type specimen available, we studied three recent collections
from the USA preserved in the NYS herbarium (see list below).#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Collybia subfumosa Speg. (holotype LPS 16121) has a 10–60 mm broad, light brown
to brown then brownish orange pileus, crowded lamellae, and a slightly larger (25–90
× 2–7 mm), white then light brown stipe which is apically ± glabrous and subpubescent
towards the base (Halling, in litt.; Spegazzini, 1887). Basidiospores are larger (8.5–11
× 5.3–6.0 µm) and cheilocystidia smaller (18–31 × 7.0–12 µm), (broadly) clavate,
sometimes irregular (the type specimens are covered by mould). Dennis (1951), however, mentioned an orange-cinnamon streaked pileus with brown ﬁbrils, a ﬁnely velvety
stipe, basidiospores measuring 7–9 × 4–5 µm, and no cheilocystidia. This probably
represents a different species. An interpretation of the species by Pegler (1983) differs
in having a white pruinose stipe (with hairs), basidiospores measuring 7.5–10 × 4–5.2
µm, and short (20–32 × 6–8 µm) cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Gymnopus contrarius (Peck) Halling (= Collybia pinastris (Kauffman) Mitchel
& A.H. Sm.) has a snuff to buffy brown pileus when fresh, fading with age to clay
or ochraceous buff on the disc and yellowish buff towards the margin. It also has a
smaller stipe (20–40 × (0.5–)1–1.5(–2.5) mm), a slightly alliaceous, garlic or rotten
cabbage odour, a taste of garlic, subastringent or not, slightly narrower basidiospores
((7.4–)8.6–9.8(–10.8) × 3.2–4.4 µm), and lacks cheilo- and pleurocystidia (Halling,#Misc-exposition*]

[@1983, 1997). According to Miyamoto et al. (1998), its pileus is even smaller (4–16 mm
broad), brown to reddish brown at centre and paler to pinkish white towards margin or
entirely pale brown and fading to very pale brown when old, and more distant lamellae
(L = 13–23).#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Gymnopus subcyathiformis (Murrill) Desjardin, Halling & Hemmes has a smaller
pileus, 10–15(–30) mm across, which ﬁnally becomes centrally depressed, a longer
(20–125 × 1–5 mm), pruinose stipe, smaller basidiospores (4.5–7.8 × 2.3–3 µm), and
smaller (7–30 × 1.5–3 µm), ﬁliform cheilocystidia (Pegler, 1977).#Misc-exposition*]

(20–50 mm across), yellowish grey, then light pinkish cinnamon or cartridge buff
pileus, a larger stipe (30–100 × 3–8 mm), smaller basidiospores (5.5–8 × 3–3.7 µm),
