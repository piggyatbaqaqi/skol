[@Pseudobaeospora calcarea, a new species of
agaricoid Hymenomycetes#Misc-exposition*]
[@H. Clémençon 1 & F. Ayer 2#Misc-exposition*]
[@Pseudobaeospora calcarea (Tricholomatales, Basidiomycetes) is a new whitish species with very acrid taste growing on mosses in a rather dry Pinus sylvestris forest
in the Rhone valley in Switzerland.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1942 Singer proposed the genus Pseudobaeospora to accommodate small, whitespored agarics with small spores showing rather thick, non-layered, strongly dextrinoid,
non-metachromatic, smooth walls lacking a germ pore, and a pileipellis consisting of
repent, radially arranged hyphae with rare or lacking clamp-connections. This generic
concept has been emended by Bas (2002, 2003) to include species with pseudoparenchymatous or irregularly hymeniform pileipelles. This author also noted that clampconnections may be present at the base of the basidia and in the subhymenium, and
that the spore wall may be metachromatic.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 The thorough taxonomic treatment of the European species of Pseudobaeospora
by Bas (2002, 2003) allowed critical evaluation of hitherto unidentiﬁable collections
belonging to that genus, and some new species were described (Adamcík & Bas, 2002;
Arnolds et al., 2004; Desjardin, 2004). Despite this new information, our collections
of a whitish species belonging to the Albidula group as circumscribed by Bas (2003)
still resisted identiﬁcation. After consulting Dr. C. Bas, who conﬁrmed our opinion,
we decided to propose a new species to accommodate our fungus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 This new species was discovered by one of us (FA) during a research project on the
deterioration of Pinus sylvestris stands conducted by the Swiss Federal Institute for
Snow and Avalanche Research WSL.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Habitat & ecology — Pseudobaeospora calcarea was repeatedly collected at different localities in a rather dry forest of Pinus sylvestris (Erico-Pinetum sylvestris
with Quercus pubescens), at an altitude of about 650 m above sea level, from June to
November 2004 and 2005. The average size of the basidiomes decreased gradually
from the beginning to the end of the collecting seasons.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 It grows among and on mosses, mainly Hypnum cupressiforme, Dicranum scoparium,
and Hylocomium splendens, and the majority of the basidiomes were attached to more
or less deteriorated gametophytes of Pleurozium schreberi. However, in the driest parts
of the pine forest, the basidiomes also occurred directly on the litter (needles and bark
of Pinus), but mosses were always present nearby. Our observations do not allow to
know if the fungus is parasitic on the moss, or if the moss only serves as a mechanical
support for the basidiome.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 The soil is a carbonated humus with pH-values of 6–7. The annual rainfall is 550
mm (200 mm from April to October). The fungus developed in localities that were
artiﬁcially watered, and in two lots where the rainfall equalled or exceeded 50 mm in
two weeks, but this relatively high level is rare in the forest studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Pseudobaeospora calcarea belongs to the informal group Albidula as deﬁned by Bas
(2003): “Basidiocarp white to pale buff. Clamp-connections present. Cheilocystidia
absent. Pileipellis not hymenidermoid”. The species so far published in this group are
P. albidula (lacking a suprapellis, pileipellis more regular, different ecology), P. paulochroma (turning yellow in KOH, more regular structure of the pileipellis composed of
hyphae, weakly metachromatic spore walls), and P. bavariae (orange-yellow ‘rhizoids’
at the stipe base, metachromatic spore walls, regular pileipellis made from hyphae, pale
sordid yellow in KOH). They differ from P. calcarea mainly in the characters indicated
in parenthesis. The key characters of P. calcarea are the lack of yellow discoloration
with KOH, the non-staining spore walls in toluidine blue, the highly irregular structure of the pileipellis, the very acrid taste (unknown for the other species of the group
Albidula), and the occurrence on mosses.#Description*]
