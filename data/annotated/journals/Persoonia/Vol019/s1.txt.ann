[@PRELIMINARY STUDIES IN THE
GENUS ENTOLOMA IN TASMANIA – I#Misc-exposition*]
[@GENEVIEVE M. GATES 1 & MACHIEL NOORDELOOS 2#Misc-exposition*]
[@This paper describes 33 new species of Entoloma from wet and dry forests in Tasmania, Australia, based on 8 years of intensive collecting, description and study of
the Entoloma mycota. As such it is a precursor to a monographic treatment of the
Entolomataceae of Tasmania, to be published in the next few years.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tasmania is the island state of Australia, lying between 40° and 43° 40' south of the
equator, and separated from the mainland of Australia by Bass Strait. The island,
with an area of 68,200 km2, is approximately the same size as Sri Lanka and a little
smaller than Ireland. Its climate can be described as modiﬁed marine Mediterranean.
The interesting, varied vegetation of the diverse habitats is a result of its geology, precipitation and the effects of the surrounding oceans on this mountainous island. This
vegetation has been described as austral montane, temperate rainforest and sclerophyll
forest (wet and dry).#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 The cool temperate rainforests dominated by Nothofagus cunninghamii and the wet
eucalypt forests dominated by Eucalyptus spp. (for a detailed description see Jackson,
1999) support a rich mycota, the majority of species of which appear to be undescribed
and unnamed.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 In Tasmania numerous species of Entoloma and related genera can be found, of
which many are new to science. A previous paper on the family Entolomataceae in
Tasmania was conﬁned to the genus Rhodocybe (Baroni & Gates, 2006). The present
paper deals with the ﬁrst lot of new taxa of Entoloma s.l. to be described from Tasmania.
They have been arranged according to their resemblance to some large groups within
the genus: Entolomatoid, with a Tricholoma-like habit and a glabrous or velutinous
pileus; Nolaneoid, with a Mycena-like habit and glabrous pileus; Leptonioid, with a
Collybia-like habit, often depressed, distinctly squamulose pileus; and Omphalinoid,
with a depressed pileus and decurrent lamellae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 The current infrageneric taxonomy of Entoloma (Romagnesi & Gilles, 1979; Noorde­
loos, 1992, 2005; Largent, 1994) is primarily based on European, North American, and
African species. These classiﬁcations, which sometimes differ considerably, are based
mainly on morphological, and to a lesser extent, chemical characteristics. Although a
number of taxa have been described from the Southern Hemisphere in the works by
Berkeley (1859), Cleland (1934, 1935), Stevenson (1962), Horak (1973, 1976, 1977,
1980, 1982) and Grgurinovic (1997), no attempt has been made so far to place them
into an infrageneric context.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PERSOONIA — Vol. 19, Part 2, 2007#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 During our study of the Tasmanian Entoloma mycota several new taxa have been
encountered that do not ﬁt into the current classiﬁcation. However, we refrain from
describing new infrageneric taxa, because current ongoing phylogenetic studies, using
molecular markers, may well throw new light on the existing classiﬁcation and the
value of certain morphological characters on which they are based.
MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Approximately 700 trips were undertaken during the period 1998–2006, predominantly
in the south, south-east and south-west of the island with some sojourns to the north-east
and north-west, mostly in the altitude range 0–750 m. The southern regions of Tasmania
contain many wet forests rich in fungi within reasonable driving distance of Hobart.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Fresh collections were photographed and described with colour notations according to Kornerup & Wanscher (1978) or Munsell Soil Colour Chart (1975). Mounts for
microscopic analysis were made from fresh and dried material and examined in water,
10% NH4OH, 3% KOH, or ammoniacal Congo Red. All measurements were made
in 10% NH4OH or 3% KOH. For basidiospore measurements, the hilar appendix was
excluded. The spore quotient Q, refers to the length divided by the width of an individual
spore. Drawings of basidiospores, cystidia and other microscopic structures were made
with the aid of a drawing tube attached to a light microscope. Holotype specimens are
deposited in the Tasmanian Herbarium (HO); isotypes are deposited at the National
Herbarium of the Netherlands, Leiden (L). Collections cited are deposited at HO or L
as designated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SPECIES#Misc-exposition*]
[@I. ENTOLOMATOID TAXA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Representatives of subg. Entoloma are poorly represented in the temperate Southern
Hemisphere, and mainly restricted to species in the group of Entoloma bloxamii (Berk.
& Broome) Sacc. of sect. Entoloma with blue or violaceous coloured basidio­carps.
This species group shows a remarkable variation in morphology, particularly with
regard to the structure of the pileipellis. This is reflected in the number of new taxa
proposed here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Entoloma indigoticoumbrinum is a fairly common species in Tasmania, with a
rather striking pileus colour, which is a mixture of brown and dark indigo blue, and a
dry velutinous-tomentose pileal surface, which tends to become cracked or wrinkled
with age. The general aspect is reminiscent of species of the complex of E. bloxamii,
with which it also shares some microscopic characters, such as the small, isodiametric
spores and abundant clamp-connections. The pileipellis structure, however, is strikingly different and would place this species in sect. Calliderma of subg. Inocephalus.
Interestingly, the species comes out in the same clade as E. bloxamii and E. prunuloides
in the preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on molecular markers (Co, unpublished
results). Several similar species have been described in the literature: Entoloma praes­
tans Corner & E. Horak differs in the smaller, quadrate spores and E. burkillii Massee
has a different pileipellis of narrow, cylindric hyphae and larger spores. Entoloma

[@	 The distinct features of E. maldea are the rather ﬁrm basidiocarps with broadly
umbonate, very dark brown pileus with contrastingly paler stipe. Microscopically it is
easily identiﬁed by the curious pigment pattern of the pileipellis with hyphae full of
dark reddish brown pigment granules, and the brown diffusely intracellular pigment of
the differentiated subpellis. This peculiar character is shared with E. chrysopus, from
which it differs in colour, smell, and in having much smaller spores. Both species apparently belong to the complex of E. translucidum E. Horak and E. perzonatum E. Horak,
characterized by a nolaneoid habit, trichodermal aspect of the pileipellis with a distinct
subpellis of inflated elements, and clampless hyphae. The New Zealand species lack
encrusting pigment, however, and are described as having a squamulose centre to
the pileus. It would be interesting to compare these Southern Hemisphere species at
molecular level with species of the sect. Fernandae, a group of closely related species
distributed in the Northern Hemisphere with a similar pigment pattern.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Entoloma lepiotoides is a soft, delicate species with a brown, woolly then distinctly
regularly squamulose pileus, resembling a Lepiota species. The small spores, lack of
cheilocystidia, and presence of clamp-connections are distinctive. Only a few species in
the literature are similar. Entoloma pervelutinum E. Horak from Papua New Guinea has
a very dark brown, concentrically squamulose pileus, and more or less similar spores
and pileipellis, but clearly differs in the dark stipe with lilac or porphyry tinges, and
the presence of clavate cheilocystidia. Entoloma vulsum E. Horak from New Zealand
is rather similar in general aspect of the basidiocarp and the small spores, differing by
having a ﬁbrillose stipe and abundant, large cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Entoloma austroprunicolor represents a species of subg. Leptonia, sect. Cyanula,
because of the general stature of the basidiocarp, clampless hyphae, and abundant brilliant granules. It has some similarity with Entoloma queletii (Boud.) Noordel., which has
a differently coloured pinkish vinaceous pileus tending to ochre when old, and a white,
ﬁbrillose stipe. Also the spore size ﬁts, but the European species has well differentiated
cheilocystidia on a sterile lamella edge. In Largent (1994) it ﬁts sect. Albidicaules, but
none of the North American species matches ours. In Horak (1980) it keys out near
E. puroides E. Horak, which, however, has completely different characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 The present species was identiﬁed as E. sericellum in the ﬁeld, because of the general
colour and habit of the basidiocarps. Microscopically, however, there are quite striking
differences, particularly with regard to the sterile lamella edge and clampless hyphae.
Also, molecular data show that it has a distant position with regard to E. sericellum.
No similar species could be traced in the literature. The papers of Horak (1973, 1980)
lead to E. niveum G. Stev. from New Zealand, which differs strikingly in the ﬁbrillose,
translucently striate pileus, smaller and narrower spores, capitate cheilocystidia, and
encrusting pigment in the pileipellis. Entoloma peralbidum E. Horak has abundant
clamp-connections, encrusting pigment, and somewhat more slender spores. Entoloma

by its grey-lilac colour, small spores, and extreme scarcity of clamp-connections. The
small spores are distinctive, the only other species in the section sharing this character,
