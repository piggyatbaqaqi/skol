[@HYGROCYBE COMOSA,
A REMARKABLE NEW AGARIC FROM THE FRENCH JURA#Misc-exposition*]

[@A small brown Hygrocybe with a papillate pileus, growing among mosses in a peat
bog in the Jura, is described as Hygrocybe comosa, spec. nov.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During a foray of the Netherlands Mycological Society in 1992 to the Fagne de
Reculfoz, 22 km E of Champagnole, a small dark brown waxcap was collected among
mosses in a peat bog. The collection was remarkable for the papillate pileus at the
centre decorated by conical squamules in all basidiocarps. The exsiccata remained at
the National Herbarium of the Netherlands, Leiden University branch (L) under the
provisional name Hygrocybe comosa. Recent examination of the material convinced
us that it represents an undescribed species indeed. In this paper we provide a Latin
diagnosis and a full description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Habitat & distribution — So far only known from the type locality in France (Jura).
Apparently very rare.#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 Hygrocybe comosa is a characteristic member of the subgenus Cuphophyllus in view
of the dull colours, decurrent lamellae and irregular hymenophoral trama. It seems to be
closest related to Hygrocybe cinerella (Kühner) Arnolds, a species with basidio­carps of
approximately the same size and similar dark colours. The size and shape of the spores
are similar too. Moreover, H. cinerella is found in related habitats, viz. peat bogs and
heathlands in arctic and boreal-alpine areas (Kühner, 1977; Boertmann, 1995). However,
H. comosa differs markedly in 1) the pileus with a central papilla; 2) the pileus centre
with large, conical squamules, a unique feature in Cuphophyllus, and the pileipellis
being a trichodermium at the pileus centre; and 3) the strongly interwoven hymenophoral trama instead of an almost subregular trama in H. cinerella (Boertmann, 1995).
The ratio between stipe and pileus may be an additional character. In our collection
of H. comosa the stipe is 2.5 – 3 times as long as the pileus diameter, whereas in
H. cinerella the stipe length is approximately equal to the pileus width (Boertmann, 1995).
However, this difference may be accidental and caused by ecological conditions.#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Hygrocybe radiata Arnolds is another related species. It differs also in the lack of
a papilla and squamules in the pileus centre. In addition, the moist pileus is deeply
translucent-striate and has a broad, paler marginal zone (Arnolds, 1989; Boertmann,
1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@	 The slender habit of H. comosa may suggest afﬁnity with the genus Omphalina.
However, species of Omphalina differ, among other things, in thinner lamellae, less
slender basidia and the presence of incrusting pigments in most species (Kuyper,
1995).#Misc-exposition*]
[@	 Hygrocybe comosa is probably a very rare species. The genus Hygrocybe has recently
received much attention in Europe (e.g. Bon, 1988; Arnolds, 1990; Boertmann, 1995;
Candusso, 1997), but apparently these authors did not know our species. In spite of its
rather striking characters it was neither noticed by Favre (1948) during his extensive
mycological explorations of peat bogs in the Swiss Jura. In view of its habitat it might
have been more widespread in the past when peat bogs in that region were more numerous and in better condition. The station of this fungus, if still existing, deserves strict
protection and H. comosa is, in our opinion, a good candidate for the forthcoming Red
List of macrofungi in Europe.#Misc-exposition*]
