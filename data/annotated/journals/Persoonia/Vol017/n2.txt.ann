[@DR. A.F.M. REIJNDERS, CENTENARIAN#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. BAS#Misc-exposition*]
[@Rijksherbarium/Hortus Botanicus, P. O. Box 9514, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands#Misc-exposition*]

[@A few weeks ago a reprint was distributed of an interesting paper on the formation of spores
by metamorphosis of basidia in fruiting bodies of Mycocalia and Scleroderma. That in itself
was not so remarkable. But it is really a small miracle that this paper was written by
Dr. A. F.M. Reijnders at the age of 99 and that it appeared in the outstanding international
mycological journal 'Mycological Research' (1999). It may take another 100 years before
a mycologist will equal this impressive performance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycology has much to thank Dr. Reijnders for. Soon after he started to publish mycolog-
ical papers in 1930, his first work on the development of the fruiting body in Agaricales
appeared (1933). This publication, in the Dutch language, is to be seen as an introduction
to the field of the ontogeny of basidiocarps and presents a survey of the work done by others
up to that time. Meticulous case studies followed in his major publications in 1948 and
1952 written in French. A real milestone, however, was the book published in 1963, that
covered the whole field of fruit-body ontogeny and its implications for taxonomy and phy-
logeny of the Agaricales s.l. This book, again in French, with an introduction by Prof. Dr.
R. Heim, became the touchstone for all later work in this field of science.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Full recognition of the value of Dr. Reijnders' research came when Dr. R. Singer invited
him to write the chapter on the development of the fruiting body of the Agaricales s.l. in
the fourth edition of his agaricological bible "The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy (1986).
And that was not the end. More publications on fruit-body ontogeny and its problems fol-
lowed, among others one on the origin of special trama types (1993) and another, with
Dr. J. A. Stalpers, on the development of the hymenophoral trama (1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@But the mycological interests of Dr. Reijnders reach much further. There are many taxo-
nomical and floristic papers on the list of his more than 80 publications that will appear in
Coolia 42 (4). (It appears that Dr. Reijnders published in 14 Dutch and 8 foreign journals!)
Many taxa new to the Netherlands have been discovered by him, particularly on his favourite
hunting grounds: the parks and avenues on clay in the alluvial district.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On account of his great achievements in mycology, Dr. Reijnders was elected honorary
president of the 6th European Mycological Congress in Avignon in 1974, received the honor-
ary membership of the ‘Nederlandse Mycologische Vereniging' in 1977, and was awarded
the Benefactor's Medal 1988 of the British Mycological Society.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although not many Dutch amateur mycologists are acquainted with Dr. Reijnders' publi-
cations on fruit-body ontogeny, many know him very well from field trips and meetings of
the *Nederlandse Mycologische Vereniging', where he showed himself to be an animated
teacher and a frequent and alert participant in mycological discussions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We heartily congratulate Dr. Reijnders and very much hope to have him still some years
with us.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus ochraceolanatus is rather similar to C. lagopus, but differs in having more
slender and densely incrusted velar elements (up to 20 µm wide), whereas C. lagopus has
smooth velar elements which are much more inflated (up to 40 µm wide). Macroscopically
the colour of the veil of C. ochraceolanatus is yellowish ochre, in C. lagopus whitish or
greyish, more rarely pale yellow but then the hyphal walls are not incrusted. See for extensive
discussion on C. ochraceolanatus Uljé & Bas (1993: 363).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The macroscopical characters like the colour of the veil, the size of the basidiocarps,
and the substrate of wood suggested that C. citrinovelatus is identical to C. ochraceolanatus.
Therefore we studied the type-material of C. citrinovelatus. The microscopical features
agree very well with those of C. ochraceolanatus. In particular the yellow incrusted elements
of the veil, less than 20 µm thick [most species in subsect. Lanatuli have veil up to 40(—50)
µm wide] is a significant character in our opinion. We could not find in the type material
the more or less branched veil as depicted in the original description, but only typical
"Lanatuli' -vcil. Therefore we consider C. citrinovelatus a synonym of C. ochraceolanatus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@TYPE SPECIMEN STUDIES IN PLEUROTUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@RONALD H. PETERSEN! & IRMGARD KRISAI-GREILHUBER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@An epitype specimen is designated for Pleurotus cornucopiae, Morphological cxam-
ination of Mexican material and the type specimen of P opuntiae showed that the distribu-
tion of this species includes North Africa and the highlands of Mexico. The type specimen
of Lentinus (Pleurotus) eugrammus reveals that Singer based his proposal of Nothopanus
on a mistaken interpretation of L. eugrammus, and that the concept of Nothopanus re-
quires a new name and type species. Neonothopanus is proposed to solve this problem.
Morphological reports are supplemented with data on mating systems.#Abstract*]

[@Although much literature has appeared, both theoretical and applied, on species of Pleurotus,
several epithets have been without documented type specimens, and therefore have been
potentially open to widely varying interpretations (see Petersen, 1995, for more on this
subject and an introduction to the literature). In previous papers, Petersen & Hughes (1993)
secured the identity of P. pulmonarius, and Petersen & Krisai-Greilhuber (1996) designated
an epitype specimen for P. ostreatus. In this paper, we report on three additional species,
P. cornucopiae, P. eugrammus, and P. opuntiae, securing each to type specimens and modern
circumscriptions, including deposition of cultures and reports of mating systems.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

& Wanscher (1973). Colours enclosed in quotation marks are from Ridgway (1912).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pleurotus cornucopiae (Paulet ex Persoon) Rolland#Misc-exposition*]

[@The earliest binomial referring to this species apparently was proposed by Jean-Jacques
Paulet. The circumstances of this name-giving are obscure, however. Paulet (1793) issued
two volumes of his Traité des Champignons, consisting of text material only, and never
mentioning the name he intended, Dendrosarcos cornucopiae. Persoon (1828: 37) attributed
the basionym to Paulet, but recombined the epithet into Agaricus cornucopiae. Fries (1830:
703) rejected Persoon's combination, considering A. cornucopiae to be synonymous under
A. (Panus) conchatus, but again attributing the basionym to Paulet. To make matters worse,
by Fries not adopting the epithet in any sanctioning volume, according to the ICBN the
name dates from Paulet, as attested to by Persoon (1828).#Misc-exposition*]

[@But if the epithet was not used in Paulet's (1793) text, where did it appear so as to gain
recognition by Persoon? Apparently (see Stafleu & Cowan, 1983: 110—111; Pfister et al.
1990), the original plates to which Paulet referred in 1793 were issued in fascicles over the
subsequent decade. Léveillé (1855) discovered Paulet’s plates, and knew that very few fasci-#Misc-exposition*]

[@cles had actually been distributed. He had the plates struck off again, wrote new textual
material to accompany them, and distributed the result. In his introduction to the re-issue.
Léveillé wrote of the rarity of Paulet's original plates, but as part of the text accompanying
the re-issued plates, Léveillé (1855: 14) used the combination Agaricus cornucopiae Per-
soon, with the basionym Dendrosarcos cornucopiae Paulet. All told, we are led to con-
clude that the original proposal of D. cornucopiae was by Paulet in text accompanying the
original fascicle of plates, including plate 28 (Fig. 1). Inquiries at WU, W, K, NY. and L
revealed that none of these libraries owned the original plates, Pfister et al. (1990) did not
see them, so they seem not to be at FH, and Pegler (pers. comm.) indicates that they are not
at PC. Reluctantly, our conclusion concerning the original proposal of D. cornucopiae cannot
be verified.#Misc-exposition*]



[@Fig. 1. Pleurotus cornucopiae. Plate from Léveillé's reproduction of Paulet's plate 28. — Bar = 1 cm#Figure*]
[@Petersen & Krisai-Greilhuber: Studies in Pleurotus 203#Page-header*]

[@Luckily, the Léveillé re-issued plates are faithful to the originals in their black-ink impres-
sions. Colour tinting, of course, was accomplished by hand, and because we cannot find a
copy of the original plates, we cannot attest to the accuracy of the colours in the Léveillé
(1855) edition. We can report, however, that the NY and WU plate 28 differ in the amount
of pink colouration used on the lamellae, with the NY copy distinctly more pink than the
copy at WU.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It can be argued that Paulet's original plate 28 can serve as a lectotype, since it was execut-
ed under Paulet's direction, and cited in his "Traité". This is so, of course, but the plate does
not show hyphal construction, spore dimensions, or cystidia. Thus, an epitype specimen
should be designated in which all structures are present, and from which cultures have been
derived.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Jean Mouchacca (PC) and Dr. Machiel Noordeloos (L) (pers. comm.) inform us that
no Paulet fungus herbarium exists, but at Leiden (L), there is a candidate Persoon specimen
(L no. 910.256-1808). Conceivably, it could serve as an epitype together with Paulet's plate
as lectotype. The specimen was annotated in Persoon's hand as "Agaricus cornucopiae.
Mycol. Europ. (the preceding twice], prope Parisior." On another annotation slip in unknown
hand [initial R. ?S.: perhaps Rolf Singer]: "Poor material. Spores not found. Hyphae thin-
walled as far as seen. Clamps seen."#Misc-exposition*]

[@The specimen comprises two basidiomata, both pressed, and in terrible condition. One
basidioma [left side] was glued to the sheet with the pileus surface toward the paper. Al-
though the entire basidioma is now brittle, woody and dark red-brown, it can be seen that
the pileus margin is inrolled, and lamellae (or the suggestion which remains) seem close
but not crowded. Small portions of stipe tissue were squashed in KOH, revealing: 1) abun-
dant mold spores and slender, septate hyphae in mycelial fragments; 2) spores of appropriate
dimensions (9 —11 x 3.8 — 4.4 µm) for Pleurotus; 3) fragments of thin-walled, clamped gener-
ative hyphae; and 4) short fragments of refringent, apparently thick-walled hyphae. The
second basidioma [right side] seems to be glued on the lamellar side, with the pileus surface
outward. A squash of the pileipellis revealed: 1) abundant Pleurotus spores as above, but
no mold spores; 2) a lattice of refringent, thick-walled hyphae which could be interpreted
as skeletal; and 3) fragments of hyaline, thin-walled, clamped generative hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Allin all, although the specimen is no longer totally identifiable, two characters are semi-
diagnostic: 1) refringent skeletal hyphae; and 2) characteristic Pleurotus basidiospores.
These are enough to tie the specimen and the name to the dimitic group within Pleurotus,
and perhaps, chiefly based on geographic location, to P. cornucopiae. Other members of
the dimitic clade are either subtropical (i.e., P. opuntiae, P. djamor) or subcentrally stipitate
(i.e. P. dryinus).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The specimen is so poorly preserved (in the original drying process) that it can hardly
serve to furnish modern characters, especially if future analysis requires more than the diag-
nosis furnished above. For this reason, we have chosen an Austrian specimen to serve as
epitype, as follows.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Persoon (1828) used the phrase "pileo carnoso albido-pallide rufescente glabro," and
mature pilei of the epitype basidiomata showed a slight orange tint together with the pallid
tan to brownish ochre pileus surface. Of the diagnostic characters furnished by Persoon
(1828), the following are fulfilled by the epitype specimen: 1) on deciduous trees; 2) some-
times in cespitose clusters but usually single; 3) pileus pallid-whitish, becoming reddish;
4) stipe villose, thick; 5) pileus usually infundibuliform; and 6) lamellae with non-inter-
venose bases. Other diagnostic characters are not matched by the epitype specimen, namely:
1) autumnal; and 2) stipe very short. These latter characters, however, are well within the
variation for such a species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of us (IK-G) has observed that rarely basidiomata of P. cornucopiae in nature exhibit
bright yellow pilei, perhaps a ‘local’ mutant within individual cespitose clusters. The yellow
form of the species has been given its own binomial, P. citrinopileatus, and seems to be the
only form of the species present in northern Asia (northern China, northern Japan, and far
eastern Russia). Hilber (1982) showed that P. cornucopiae was genetically isolated (i.e.,
incompatible with other Pleurotus species), but he lacked monokaryon isolates of P. citri-
nopileatus and could not report on their compatibility. Ohira (1990) demonstrated that
P. citrinopileatus was intercompatible with P. cornucopiae, and this was confirmed by
Petersen & Hughes (1993) using other isolates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hilber (1982) noted that basidiomata of P. cornucopiae produced under laboratory condi-
tions sometimes formed an evanescent veil. This character is similar to the same phenom-
enon in P. levis (= Panus strigosus), where virtually no evidence of the veil can be found
on basidiomata in nature. The habit of P. cornucopiae (i.c., distinct stout stipe) might cause
the comparison with P. /evis to be carried further, but basidiomata of P. calyprratus also
form a veil: indeed, the taxon is diagnosed by this structure. Basidiomata of P. calvprratus,
however, are strictly pleurotoid, more closely resembling those of P. djamor, another species
with dimitic hyphal construction. Vilgalys & Sun (1994) used DNA sequences to construct
a generic phylogeny. Pleurotus cornucopiae and its variant P. citrinopileatus shared identical
sequences, with P. djamor and P. calyptratus within the same clade. The clade was labelled
as the P. djamor-cornucopiae clade. Pleurotus levis was well-separated, appearing within
the ‘P. ostreatus clade’, in spite of its dimitic hyphal construction.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The large size of microdroplets in cultures of P. cornucopiae is consistent with data from
other similar species exhibiting dimitic hyphal construction (P. djamor, P. calyptratus). This
is in contrast to the small microdroplets in cultures of monomitic taxa (P. ostreatus, P. pulmo-
narius, etc.). The odour of cultures of P. cornucopiae is quite similar to that found in cultures
of P. pulmonarius, however, indicating that the same general chemistry may be present
across the genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pleurotus eugrammus (Mont.) Dennis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1838) placed the species in Lentinus but attributed the species epithet to Montagne
as "in sched." but Montagne (1845) did not publish the name until later. Thus the nomen-
clatural position of the basionym is in Lentinus, although that generic name was used in a
broad sense at that time. Because of Fries' attribution, the type specimen is to be found in
herb. Montagne.#Misc-exposition*]
[@208 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 2, 1999#Page-header*]

[@Singer (1944) segregated Nethopanus from Pleurotus based on his own concept of
N. eugrammus. Horak (1968: 485), placed Nothopanus in synonymy under Pleurotus, but
also (Horak, 1968: 679) furnished a description and illustrations of the ‘type specimen’ of
N. (Lentinus) eugrammus. Most recently, Singer (1986) placed Pleurotus eugrammus sensu
Singer in Pleurotus sect. Pleurotus, which included both monomitic and dimitic hyphal
construction. While such placement can be accepted merely on miticity, other characters
disallow placement of Singer's N. eugrammus in Pleurotus at all.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In examining several specimens (almost all from NY) under various combinations of
eugrammus, it became evident that most represented small, marasmielloid basidiomata (i.e..
stipitate-pleurotoid, often semi-everted), while some comprised or at least included large,
pleurotoid basidiomata with only rudimentary stipes. Two taxa obviously were represented.
The former was found to agree with the description by Corner (1981), and subsequently to
agree with common usage of Nothopanus (see below under specimens examined of Notho-
panus sensu Singer), The two taxa shared a lobate and invariably sulcate-striate pileus mar-
gin, but very different hyphal construction and basidiospore shape. This discrepancy led to
an investigation of Lentinus eugrammus, the type specimen of which is described below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These specimens represent Lentinus (Pleurotus) eugrammus sensu vero. Horak (1968)
examined the ‘type specimen’ of Lentinus eugrammus from PC, and while he did not explicit-
ly describe a dimitic hyphal construction, his illustrations of tramal and pileus surface hyphae
could be interpreted as such, his spore measurements (with illustration) surely could repre-
sent a Pleurotus, and in discussion, Horak indicated Nothopanus as a synonym under Pleuro-
tus. Horak's observations were correct, and based on examination of much additional ma-
terial, the spores measured and illustrated by Horak were also correct (there are several
spore types adhering to the type specimen, at least three of which represent basidiospores).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Singer (1950) examined fresh material of what he thought was Lentinus eugrammus,
and used his own (Singer, 1944) interpretation as the type of Nothopanus. Horak (1968:
679—681) examined the type specimen of L. eugrammus, and concluded that this specimen
was not the same as Singer's sense of the species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our examination of Singer's specimens under N. eugrammus (see below under specimens
examined) has confirmed that Singer's (1944) interpretation of L. eugrammus does not match
the type specimen of that species, and therefore represents a misapplication of that epithet.
Art. 7.5 of the ICBN (1994) states that a type specimen applies to all combinations of the
epithet. Modern placement of L. eugrammus is important because this placement brings
the genus name Nothopanus with it. Like Horak (1968) we consider the type specimen of
L. eugrammus to be a Pleurotus, and Singer's Nothopanus to be a synonym of that genus.
Nevertheless, Singer's (1944) concept of Nothopanus as taxonomically distinct is correct.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Given this entire situation, two nomenclatural avenues are open: 1) propose conservation
of Nothopanus Singer with a different type species, requiring a separately published proposal
with justification; or 2) accept Nothopanus Singer as a synonymous genus name, and propose
a new genus name to represent Singer's concept, with a new type species for the concept.
We have chosen the latter path, as follows:#Misc-exposition*]

rapidly growing colonies, morphology was of sparsely cottony fans, and in slow colonies,
growth was by compact fans, often of more compressed hyphae. All colonies produced
common to abundant ‘microdroplets’, with two notable characteristics: 1) microdroplets
were extremely large (5-17 µm diam.) when compared to those produced by other species,
including P. djamor forms; and 2) microdroplets are formed on hyphal tips as well as on
shorter side branches, contrary to other taxa which produce microdroplets only on short,
slender side branches.#Description*]

[@No evidence of asexual propagule production has been seen in P. opuntiae, but basidio-
mata of P. australis from nature also show no evidence of asexual spore production, although
basidiome primordia fruited under laboratory conditions produce a turf of dark gray to black
arthospores (see Petersen et al., 1997), Asexual reproduction in P. opuntiae cannot be ruled
out, therefore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomata of P. levis, with dimitic hyphal construction, prominent stipe. and pale col-
ours, produce à partial veil, at lcast in some fruitings. Its range includes at least some Carib-
bean islands (i.e., Puerto Rico), but the pileus surface is composed of a strigose trichoderm,
not repent hyphae. Production of a partial veil and trichodermoid pileus surface separate
P. levis from P. opuntiae. Likewise, P. dryinus also is diagnosed by the presence of a partial
veil. Moreover, cultures of P. dryinus consistently produce brown, thick-walled arthro-
conidia, and the species seems limited to the North Temperate Zone.#Misc-exposition*]

Notes on Agaricus section Spissicaules#Misc-exposition*]

[@MARUKE M. NAUTA#Misc-exposition*]

[@Rijksherbarium/Hortus Botanicus, P.O. Box 9514, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands#Institution*]

[@The subsection Spissicaules of Agaricus section Sanguinolenti is raised to section level.
It is mainly characterised by the simple annulus, the presence of yellowing rhizomorphs,
yellow discolouration of the context or surface at the base of the stipe and a positive
Schaeffer-reaction, and the slightly reddening context in the higher part of the stipe. Sec-
tion Spissicaules comprises three species in the Netherlands, viz. Agaricus lanipes,
A. litoralis, and A. bresadolanus. Both A. maskae and A. spissicaulis are considered synon-
ymous with A. litoralis; A. romagnesii is regarded as conspecific with A. bresadolanus.
A new species is described from the Netherlands and Great Britain, A. ruforegulis, which
is tentatively placed in subgenus Lanagaricus on account of the covering of the pileus
and stipe.#Abstract*]

[@Section Spissicaules#Misc-exposition*]

[@The group of species related to Agaricus lanipes is characterised by the presence of a simple.
thin annulus, yellowing rhizomorphs, and the usual yellow discolouration of the context or
surface at the base of the stipe, in combination with a positive Schaeffer-reaction (cross-
reaction of Anilin and concentrated nitric acid) there. The Schaeffer cross-reaction is negative
on the surface of the pileus. Heinemann (1978) considered the group to be a subsection of
the section Sanguinolenti J. Schaeff. & F. Moller, viz. subsection Spissicaules. lt differs
from section Sanguinolenti, however, in the only faintly reddish discolouration of the
context, in combination with a yellow discolouration in the base, and the structure of the
annulus, which has in section Sanguinolenti a double margin or large marginal squames at
the underside. It may be regarded as an intermediate between the group in Agaricus with
preddening context or surface of pileus or stipe, and the group with yellowing context or
surface of pileus or stipe. The species have also characters in common with section
Xanthodermi Sing., viz. the yellow discolouration in the base of the stipe, but have a less
persistent annulus which is not double at the margin and, in contrast to the species of
Xanthodermi, a positive Schaeffer-reaction on the base of the stipe. Because of its separate
position, and no clear affinities to other sections, in particular not with Sanguinolenti, the
subsection is raised to section level here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Netherlands and adjacent regions three species are recognised within the section
Spissicaules, to which a key is given below. Bon (1985) considers also the following species
to belong to the subsection Spissicaules: Agaricus ludovici Remy, A. ducheminii M. Bon.
A. vinosobrunneus P. D. Orton and A. luteolorufescens P.D. Orton. Agaricus ludovici Remy
resembles the species of this section in the morphology of the ring, but is more similar to
A. campestris in other aspects, a.o. the presence of a germpore (Remy, 1964). The name is
invalidly published since no type was designated (ICBN, 1994, art. 37.1). Agaricus duche-
minii M. Bon (1985) probably belongs to section Spissicaules, but its identity is uncertain
to the author. It may be a synonym of Agaricus litoralis. It is characterised by a white.
distinctly yellowing pileus, and spores of 7-8.5 µm long. It was, however, originally
described as a subspecies of Agaricus ludovici (A. ludovici subsp. littoralis Duchemin, 1979),
and therefore also invalidly published (ICBN, 1994, art. 43.1). Types were studied of
Agaricus vinosobrunneus P.D. Orton. which is a form of A. silvaticus J. Schaeff.: Fr., and
A. luteolorufescens P.D. Orton, which proved to be a clear synonym of A. lanipes.#Misc-exposition*]

17-11-1957, P. D. Orton 1112). The macroscopical features show strong resemblance with
Agaricus lanipes, something Orton himself already noticed. Also, the spores, measuring
5.8—7(-7.5) x 4-5 µm, and the lamella-edge with a broad sterile layer of short chains of
globose, up to 12 µm wide, cheilocystidia, fall within the range of A. /anipes. Therefore
this taxon is considered synonymous with Agaricus lanipes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The lamella-edge was never entirely sterile in the examined collections. The amount of
cheilocystidia on the lamella-edge seems to be rather variable, but they are always narrow
and resemble young basidia. In dried fruit-bodies the cystidia are often inconspicuous, in
fresh fruit-bodies the cheilocystidia are more easily seen, and are even shortly catenate
sometimes. Also, in dried material, the lamella-edge is very often agglutinated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some authors (a.o. Bon, 1985; Cappelli, 1984; Knudsen, 1992) considered Agaricus lito-
ralis merely a form of A. devoniensis P.D. Orton. Study of the type material of Agaricus
litoralis (K, Saunton Down, North Devon, 4 June 1945, leg. F. R. Elliston Wright) revealed
that the spores are slightly larger than stated in the type description (Pearson, 1946), i.c.
7.1-8.4 x 5.5-6.4 µm, and the lamella-edge is only partly sterile with inconspicuous basidio-
liform cheilocystidia which measure 16-24 x 5—7 µm. Agaricus devoniensis, which belongs
to section Edules, has a sterile lamella-edge with conspicuous globose, 9-13 µm wide,
cheilocystidia, and spores which are in general smaller than those of A. /iroralis, viz. 5.6—
7.4 x 4.3-5.7 µm. Also, the original notes and drawings of Pearson (Fig. 3) show a much
sturdier fruit-body, which much resembles the plate of Psalliota spissa by Moller (1950).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus spissicaulis was described by Moller as a species with spores 5-7 x 4-5.5 µm.
Two collections present in Herbarium Kopenhagen which were identified by Moller
have, however, average spore sizes of 6.9—7.1 x 5.2 µm resp. 7.6 x 5.1 µm (pers. comm.
M. Brand), much closer to those given of Agaricus maskae (Pilát, 1954: 7.2—7.8 x 3.8-4.3
µm). Wasser (1979) also noticed that the spores of these collections were larger than
mentioned in the type description.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The difference between Agaricus maskae Pilát and A. spissicaulis F. Moller is, apart
from the supposed difference in spore size, the size of the pileus which is larger in A. maskae.
This is here considered of no taxonomical importance but due to ecological circumstances.
The two species are considered conspecific. Agaricus litoralis is regarded as a synonym
because of the strong macroscopical resemblance and the similarity in microscopical charac-
ters. Since it is the oldest name it has priority.#Misc-exposition*]

homonym of A. infidus Peck.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Romagnesi (1937) Psalliota campestris var. radicata Vittad. differed from
Agaricus campestris in the presence of marginal cystidia and the yellow discolouration of
the pileus. Consequently, he raised the taxon to species level and named it Agaricus radica-
tus, unfortunately a later homonym of A. radicatus Relh.: Fr. Bohus (1961) noticed that
material collected in Hungary resembled this taxon but differed in the absence of cystidia
and the yellowing of the pileus. Also, the base of the stipe is more or less bulbous. Later a
new species was described, based on the material from Hungary, named A. bresadolanus
Bohus (1969; as A. bresadolianus), but the surface of the pileus was also said to discolour
slightly yellow.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Wasser created a new species, Agaricus romagnesii Wasser (1977), based on Ukrainian
material, differing from A. bresadolanus only in the presence of cystidia and a less bulbous
base of the stipe. Wasser refers, in so doing, also to the interpretation of Romagnesi ( 1937)
of Agaricus radicatus. Remarkable is that Wasser says that the cheilocystidia are absent
and that the pleurocystidia are 30—40 x 8-15 µm. Wasser also refers to the interpretation
of Reid (1972) of A. bresadolanus, who describes and depicts a collection from Kingston
Bagpuize in England with clavate sterile elements on the lamella-edge of 20-32 x 5.75-
8.75 µm. But, as Reid already stated, it may be that the discrepancies between the descrip-
tions of A. bresadolanus and the British material are caused by a different interpretation of
the nature of the elements on the lamella-edge. The collection which was cited by Reid
was studied from Herbarium Kew, but the lamella-edge was agglutinated and the sterile
elements could not be seen clearly, suggesting a heterogencous lamella-edge with scattered
sterile, up to 8 tum wide, clavate elements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collections which were examined in this study show a variable amount of sterile
elements on the lamella-edge, sometimes only dispersed narrow sterile clements are found,
sometimes the edge is almost sterile and the elements are up to 14 µm wide. Also, some
collections seem to have a sterile lamella-edge when studied fresh, but have a minority of
sterile elements when studied after drying. Since this only possible distinguishing character
proved to be that variable, all collections are considered to belong to the same species,
A. bresadolanus, and A. romagnesii is considered to be synonymous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus rufotegulis Nauta#Misc-exposition*]

[@In June 1997 Mr. J. Wisman found an Agaricus on a rotting heap of leaves in Amersfoort,
the Netherlands, and sent it to the author at the Rijksherbarium. No name for the specimens
could be found then. Shortly after, a similar collection of Agaricus was shown to the author
during a visit to the Kew Herbarium. It was collected by Mr. E. Brown from a rotting heap
of leaves in Claremont landscape park, Surrey, Great Britain, in August 1997. The two col-
lections proved to belong to the same taxon, and a thorough research did not provide a
name for it. Therefore it is described here as new.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus rufotegulis superticially resembles A. lanipes, but differs in the more evanescent
annulus and the absence of the brown girdles at the base of the stipe, the smaller reddish
squamules on the pileus and the pruinose stipe. It also reminds somewhat of the brownish
form of Agaricus moelleri, because of the remarkable small fibrillose reddish brown squames
on the pileus. It differs from this taxon a.o. in the large but non-persisting annulus, and the
positive Schaeffer-reaction on the base of the stipe. The species may show some similarity
with old fruit-bodies of A. porphyrizon, which has a more persistent, narrower annulus with
smooth underside and more vinaceous brown squames on the pileus.#Diagnosis*]

[@This taxon is macroscopically characterised by the reddish brown squamulose pileus,
the large annulus remaining for long attached to the margin of the pileus with à brown.
squamose underside, the presence of yellowing rhizoids and the yellow discolouration of
the base of the stipe, and the pruinose surface of the lower part of the stipe.#Description*]

[@Close examination of the pruinose covering of the lower part of the stipe showed loosely
connected chains of almost globose elements, similar to the elements at the underside of
the annulus, which are remnants of the general veil (Fig. 5d). Most species occurring in
northwestern Europe have a pileus covering composed in majority of cylindric, up to 8 µm
wide elements, intermixed with some broader, inflated elements. In most examined species
veil or squames on the pileus or stipe cannot be distinguished microscopically from the
pileipellis which is a cutis.#Description*]

[@Subgenus Lanagaricus is distinguished from subgenus Agaricus, to which most European
species belong, by the presence of a cottony general veil, covering the pileus and lower
part of the stipe (Heinemann, 1956). According to the interpretation of Freeman (1979),
the general veil is composed of inflated, up to 11 µm wide, elements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the general veil of this species is so strikingly different from the other
species, that it is tentatively placed in the subgenus Lanagaricus section Laeticolores
Heinem., close to A. ficophilus Heinem. or A. rufoaurantiacus Heinem., even though the
pileus is not covered with cottony veil. The subdivision into subgenera within Agaricus
needs careful evaluation, preferably based on morphological as well as molecular data.#Misc-exposition*]

and clamped form. In addition, M. lutea differs from M. olivaceoflava because of its smaller
spores (7-8 x 4-5 µm in the tetrasporic form), differently shaped caulocystidia and its

[@Villarreal, Heykoop & Maas Geesteranus: Further new species of Mycena from Spain — Il. 239#Page-header*]

[@Mycena rubidofusca was at first thought to be a member of section /nsignes Maas G.
(Maas Geesteranus, 1989: 343) on account of the gelatinous layer covering the hyphae of
both the pileipellis and the stipitipellis. A similar coating, however, is also known in Mycena
stipata Maas G. & Schwóbel (Maas Geesteranus & Schwóbel, 1987: 147), a species of
section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél. (Maas Geesteranus, 1988: 43). All species of this section
have invariably ascending lamellae, with their lamella-edge ventricose. This feature, in the
authors’ opinion, places M. rubidofusca in section Fragilipedes, very close to Mycena sti-
pata, but it entails the following important changes. Mycena quinaultensis Kauff. apud A.H.
Smith (Maas Geesteranus, 1989: 350) and M. conspersa Maas G. & de Meijer (Maas Geeste-
ranus & de Meijer. 1997: 84), former members of the /nsignes, must for the same reason
(ascending lamellae; hyphae of both the pileipellis and the stipitipellis embedded in gelat-
inous matter) be transferred to the Fragilipedes. This strengthens the homogeneity of section
Insignes and, however slightly, alters its diagnosis.#Misc-exposition*]

section /nsignes, are now best included in section Fragilipedes. It is certainly true that,

Following the key of this section (Maas Geesteranus, 1986), it keys out close to M. seynesi-

M. hepatica, because of the lack of liver-colour, its viscous separable elastic pellicle on the

from France (Kühner, 1938: 419) and Germany. The macroscopic description of the latter
does not seem to differ much from that of M. hepatica except for the colour of the margin
of pileus ("..., whitish towards the margin ...") and the clearly nitrous odour. The micro-
scopical differences do not seem to be very sharp either, though the width and extent of

[@1. SUBGENUS STERCOPHILA#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species of subgenus Stercophila [Romagn. ex Noordel., Persoonia 16 (1995) 127] are
characterized by the presence of a slimy veil, which forms a sticky-glutinous layer on the
surface of pileus and stipe. Additional characters of this group are the very dark, large spores
with a very distinct germ pore. The best known species of this group is Psilocybe semi-
globata (Batsch: Fr.) Noordel., a widespread and locally common dung-inhabiting species.
Traditionally, this species has been placed in the genus Stropharia, mainly because of the
presence of an annulus and the occurrence of chrysocystidia on the sides of the lamellae.
Psilocybe luteonitens (Fr.: Fr.) Park.-Rhodes which is very similar in morphology and
ecology, has no chrysocystidia, and was therefore placed in the genus Psilocybe sensu stricto
by some authors. However, Romagnesi (1936) considered both taxa very closely related
because of the glutinous veil on pileus and stipe, and placed them together in the genus
Stercophila. Singer (1986) made Stercophila Romagn. a section of Stropharia. Noordeloos
(1995), uniting the genera Stropharia, Hypholoma and Psilocybe sensu stricto in one large
genus Psilocybe, gave Stercophila the rank of subgenus. Recently Esteve-Raventós &
Barassa (1995) described a new species in this group, viz. Stropharia dorsipora, char-
acterized by spores with an eccentrically placed germ pore. During the revision of this group
for the Flora agaricina neerlandica, several collections of this species were detected in the
herbaria from the Netherlands, Switzerland and California, which are described below.
According to personal observations and those of Dr. I. Kytóvuori (University of Helsinki,
Finland), more taxa of subgenus Stercophila can be expected to occur in Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An interesting species in this respect is Pholiota myosotis (Fr.: Fr.) Sing. This species,
in the rather isolated subgenus Phaeonematoloma Sing., has very similar glutinous veil on
pileus and stipe, pleurocystidia as chrysocystidia, and also very large spores, which, however,
are red-brown in mass, not as dark as in the species around Psilocybe semiglobata, and
have only a small, inconspicuous germ pore. Also the habitat is different, as it grows as
saprophytic or possibly necrotrophic among Sphagnum in peat-bogs.#Misc-exposition*]
[@246 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 2. 1999#Page-header*]

[@There are several examples in the Strophariaceae, where species with thin- and thick-
walled spores, with or without distinct germ pore appear to be closely related. Good exam-
ples are Psilocybe section Psilocybe, where species with thin-walled spores (P. inquilinus,
P. crobula) are closely related to P. montana with dark, thick-walled spores (Noordeloos et
al., in prep.). In Psilocybe subgenus Hypholoma section Psilocyboides thin-walled spores
occur in the group of Psilocybe elongatipes, which obviously are related to P. ericaeum
and P. udum with thick-walled spores. It is to be expected that future experimental research
would prove that Pholiota myosotis is closely related to the Stercophila group in Psilocybe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Holotype species: Psilocybe elongata (Pers.: Fr.) J. Lange.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Psilocybe elongata can be recognized in the field by the yellow colour of the pileus and
brownish lamellae, and microscopically by the relatively thin-walled spores with a small,
often indistinct germ pore. Psilocybe ericaoides, which is similarly yellow-coloured, can
easily be differentiated by the violaceous-grey tinges in the mature lamellae, caused by the
thick-walled spores with distinct germ pore.#Diagnosis*]

[@As noted by Singer (1986) the complex of P. elongata contains several very similar taxa,
and is still in need of a revision. As a whole they can be distinguished from other species in
sect. Psilocyboides by the lack of veil combined with relatively pale, thin-walled spores
with small, often indistinct germ pore. Accordingly the mature lamellae are usually a shade
of (grey-)brown, rarely with a slight violaceous-purple tinge. The group of P. marginata#Misc-exposition*]
[@Noordeloos: Notulae ad floram agaricinam neerlandicam — XXXIV 249#Page-header*]

[@(subsect. Marginatae) can be distinguished by the prominent veil, and thick-walled spores
with distinct germ pore, and the species in subsect. Ericaeae have dark, thick-walled spores
and grey-violaceous mature lamellae. Psilocybe tuberosa (Redh. & Kroeger) Walleyn is
rather aberrant by its growth from sclerotia, and is therefore placed in its own subsection
Tuberosae. Subsect. Elongatae contains several taxa, some of which occur both in Europe
and in North America. Important diagnostic features to separate taxa are found in the size
and shape of spores and cystidia and in the presence or absence of cheilochrysocystidia.
Additional macroscopic features are mainly found in the presence or absence of yellow
pigments in pileus and lamellae. Up to now about six taxa have been distinguished from
Europe (Moser, 1983; Watling & Gregory, 1987), viz. Psilocybe elongatipes, P. xantho-
cephalum, P. laeticolor. P. longisporum and P. politrichi. In addition, Smith ( 1951) records
some other related taxa from North America, viz.: Hypholoma humidicola (Murrill) A.H.

within subsection Elongatae also some dark coloured taxa could be found which were not
known from Europe before. Both are characterized by having a dark pileus and lack of yel-
low tinges in the lamellae. One could be identified as Psilocybe olivaceotincta Kauffm..

the differences in size as indicated by Smith may appear insignificant. The difference
in habitat (Sphagnum-bogs for Psilocybe elongata, among moss in coniferous forest for
Hypholoma humidicola) may also be of minor importance. Several collections of Psilocybe

soil, but without Sphagnum. So far it has been recorded from the Faeróes, Scotland and the
Netherlands. Moeller (1945) described also Naematoloma subfusisporum which is very
similar, but differs in even narrower, fusiform spores. So far this taxon is only known from
the type-locality.#Diagnosis*]

[@Some authors distinguish Psilocybe pseudocyanea and P. ochrocyanea as two different
species (Bon, 1972), Glowinski & Gumbinger (1982), Orton (1976). However, the differ-
ences given are difficult to use. Environmental factors, such as height of the vegetation,
and exposure to sunlight seem to have great effect on the macromorphology of the
basidiocarps. Jahnke (1984) demonstrated that strains of both taxa have a DNA homology
close to 100%, which supports the contention that only one genetic taxon is involved. For
that reason both taxa are distinguished here as forms of one, variable species:#Misc-exposition*]

[@A study of the macroscopic and microscopic characters of type materials of Tulostoma
macrosporum, T. meridionale and T. utahense is presented. The synonymy of the two
latter species, that was proposed some years ago, is now verified. Tulostoma macrosporum
is very close to them, but shows enough differential features to be maintained as an auton-
omous species. SEM photographs of the spore ornamentation are provided.#Abstract*]

[@This report is a continuation of a series of studies on type materials of species described
in the genus Tulostoma Pers.: Pers. in an attempt to resolve some taxonomic problems. It is
relatively frequent in this genus to find species named with different epithets in various
geographical areas, which increases very much their apparent number. We have already
demonstrated some of these synonymies, based principally on the study of the spore orna-
mentation under SEM, in other papers: Altés & Moreno (1993, 1995), Moreno et al. (1992,
1995, 1997), Altés et al. (1999). We thus believe it is feasible to reduce the number of specific
epithets of Tulostoma to a more realistic level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the present paper we compare the types of three species with very similar macroscopic
characteristics and spores greater than 6.5 µm diameter (exceptional in the genus), to clar-
ify their possible synonymy: Tulostoma macrosporum G. Cunn. (Cunningham, 1925) from
Australia, and 7; meridionale J.E. Wright (Wright et al., 1972) and T. utahense J.E. Wright
(Wright, 1987) from the USA. The author of the two latter species already mentioned their
great similarity and their possible synonymy (Wright, 1987). Later, this synonymy was pro-
posed by Moreno et al. (1995) based on several Mexican collections and literature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A NEW SPECIES OF BOUBOVIA (PEZIZALES)
FROM THE HVALER ARCHIPELAGO IN NORWAY#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. VAN BRUMMELEN! & R. KRISTIANSEN?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boubovia vermiphila spec. nov. (Pezizales) is described from the mycologically inter-
esting Hvaler archipelago in southern Norway, occurring on casts of earthworms. The
relationship with Pulvinula and Boubovia luteola is discussed. Some distinctive characters
between Pulvinula and Boubovia are considered.#Abstract*]

[@The Hvaler archipelago is a small group of islands situated in the temperate zone of Norway,
close to the Swedish border, about 100 km south-east of Oslo, up to 75 m above sea-level.
The geographical position and their ecological and phenological conditions make them
favourable for the growth of a wide variety of operculate discomycetes (Pezizales, Asco-
mycota). The geology is Precambrian, and consists of granites and gneisses. The landscape
is covered with marine sediments, sand- and shell-beds, sand-dunes, fields of heather, shal-
low marshes, calcareous clay and earth which often fill the cavities and open spaces between
rocks. The forests consist of coniferous and deciduous trees. The soil is rich in nutrients
and lime, giving rise to a great diversity of phanerogams, including numerous rare calci-
colous species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second author has studied the fungi of this region, with special emphasis on the
Pezizales, for more than fifteen years. Thus far, over 130 species among 46 genera of Pezi-
zales and Thelebolaceae have been recorded, the most noticeable of which are: Aleuria
bicucullata (Boud.) Gill., Boudiera acanthospora Dissing & T. Schumach., Rhodoscypha

[@In 1983 an enigmatic minute discomycete was discovered, which did not seem to fit any
known species at that time. Additional material was found at the same locality in 1989,
1990, and 1998, but was not found in the intervening years. Study of the latest rich collection
confirmed earlier suspicions that it was a new species of Boubovia Svréek.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ish tints, showing only a weakly developed excipulum, broadly clavate asci with huge oper-
cula, as well as different, larger ascospores, and rather thick, straight paraphyses with
thickened ends.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boubovia vermiphila differs also from the recently described coprophilous Chalazion
erinaceus Doveri et al. (Doveri et al., 1998), as we could confirm from a study of the type
specimen. Chalazion erinaceus has much smaller (75—100 µm diam.) orbiculate to pulvinate
white to dirty white apothecia; the excipulum is very restricted, showing cells that easily
stain with methyl blue; while the asci are broadly clavate and smaller (62-72 x 23-34 µm)
with an operculum about 24 µm across; the paraphyses are not curved and slightly swollen
near the ends.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It shows great similarity in growth and structure with species of Pulvinula Boud. and
especially with Boubovia luteola (Velen.) Svréek ( Velenovsky, 1934, as Humaria luteola;
Svréek, 1977, 1978; Kristiansen & Schumacher, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chalazion was tentatively placed in the Thelebolaceae (Hawksworth et al., 1983; Eriksson
& Hawksworth, 1998), but results of DNA-sequencing (Landvik et al., 1998b) indicate
that Chalazion groups most closely with Glaziella Berk. and with Pulvinula, both belonging
to the Pyronemataceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boubovia vermiphila differs from Boubovia luteola in the smaller pulvinate apothecia,
the larger and more abundantly ornamented ascospores with large polar caps. It may also
be related to Octospora spaniosa K.B. Khare (Khare, 1975), but that has much smaller
very finely reticulate ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The similarity to Pulvinula, as defined by Rifai (1968), Pfister (1976), Korf & Zhuang
(1984, 1991), and Hohmeyer (1988). is in the eugymnohymenial development, pulvinate
apothecia, yellow carotenoid pigment, identical textures of the cortex and the medulla, asci
with a pleurorhynchous bifurcate base, and very thin, filiform paraphyses with strongly
curved ends. It differs, however, in its clearly ornamented, ellipsoid ascospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species with ellipsoid ascospores were accepted in Pulvinula by Pfister (1976) and by
Korf & Zhuang (1984, 1991), but Yao & Spooner (1996a, 1996b) transferred such species
to Boubovia Svréek. Besides the spore shape, they considered the presence of thick walls
at a certain stage in young asci to be of sufficient importance for these transfers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The value of the last mentioned character must be considered doubtful, since it concerns
a cytological character based on post-mortem observations. It is well known that the inner
layer of the ascus wall may swell strongly by imbibition when the ascus turgor disappears
(Boedijn, 1933; van Brummelen, 1986, 1998; Baral, 1992), especially when placed in certain
media for microscopic observation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A reliable character of species of Pulvinula may be found in the development of the
ascospores. Wu & Kimbrough (1993) demonstrated in ascospores of Pulvinula convexella
(P. Karst.) Pfister a strongly zonated epispore and an outermost thin layer of the secondary
spore wall which is finely echinulate or granular, which is not visible with light microscopy.
In the view of these authors the outer layer of the episporium is directly deposited from the
epiplasm, which would mean that the epispore becomes the outer spore layer. The early
wall development in Pulvinula differs from that found in all other representatives of the
large family of the Pyronemataceae, like Aleuria, Octospora, Humaria, Trichophaea, Pseud-
ombrophila, and Scutellinia. Unpublished studies by the first author confirm this special
mode of ascospore development in Pulvinula convexella and P. ovalispora Boud. In Bou-
bovia luteola and B. vermiphila, with complex and extensive ascospore ornamentations,#Misc-exposition*]

[@the development of the secondary wall will be a more complex process, but ultrastructural
confirmation will be needed. In Pulvinula the smooth ascospores are naked (i.e. devoid of
a secondary wall). This would mean that Pulvinula should be restricted to species with
smooth spores, whether globose or ellipsoid, while Boubovia should accommodate species
with ornamented spores, so far all showing ellipsoid spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Air or gas inclusions are almost constantly reported as ‘de Bary bubbles’ for ascospores
of Pulvinula, but in Boubovia these inclusions are produced only occasionally. This differ
ence can be explained by the very dense, stratified, impermeable epispore in Pulvinula
(Wu & Kimbrough, 1993) and a supposed more simple one in Boubovia.#Misc-exposition*]
[@270 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17. Part 2, 1999#Page-header*]

[@The taxonomic position of Boubovia is within the Pyronemataceae, since the ascus apical
apparatus is of the Octospora type (van Brummelen, 1978, 1986), also found in Pulvinula
convexella and P. ovalispora. A subapical swelling in the shape of a ring can be observed
at the inner side of the ascus wall at some distance behind the ascus tip, while the operculum
and the ascostome are rather roughly delimited during ascus dehiscence (Fig. IF). In all
genera of the Pyronemataceae studied thus far this type of ascus apical apparatus could be
established.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Preliminary results of DNA-sequencing by Dr. S. Landvik (pers. comm.) indicate that
both Boubovia luteola and B. vermiphila are grouping close to Pulvinula and Chalazion,
other representatives of the Pyronemataceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This supplement deals with the diagnostic characteristics and literature data of three spe-
cies of Phoma sect. Plenodomus: Phoma korfii spec. nov. (synanamorph Sclerotium oro-
banches Schwein.: Fr.). Phoma pimpinellae spec. nov. (teleomorph Leptosphaeria pim-
pinellae Lowen & Sivan.) and Phoma etheridgei L..J. Hutchison & Y. Hirats. (only known

[@The species placed in Phoma sect. Plenodomus (Preuss) Boerema et al. (1981) are charac-
terised by their ability to produce scleroplectenchyma in the peridium of the pycnidia. Those
occurring on herbaceous plants are often anamorphs of species of the Ascomycete genus
Leptosphaeria Ces. & De Not. with a scleroplectenchymatous ascocarp wall.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Study in vivo and in vitro of the "Ascochyta' pathogen of lupin, indigenous to America,
showed its conidial dimorphism. The phomoid phenotype developing in vitro and some-
times also in vivo is described as a new species of Phoma sect. Heterospora. The asco-
chytoid-stagonosporoid phenotype commonly occurring in association with disease
symptoms is transferred to Stagonosporopsis.#Abstract*]

[@In Contribution IV (Boerema et al., 1997) the section Heterospora was introduced for Phoma
species producing apart from mainly aseptate, phomoid conidia also distinctly larger conidia,
which may become one or more septate, “ascochytoid or stagonosporoid’. Most of these
fungi are pathogens specific to particular hosts. The two types of conidia apparently play
different roles in the life cycle. The large, septate conidial phenotypes may be dominant in
association with disease symptoms and are referred to Stagonosporopsis Died. The phomoid,
aseptate conidia are sometimes only produced on dead host material. Humidity and temper-
ature are apparently important co-factors which determine the conidial type. Both types
may occur successively in the same pycnidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In vitro on standard agar media, the conidia are generally mainly aseptate-phomoid, but
occasionally in vitro, several large, septate conidia develop as well; this possibly occurs
when growth conditions are fluctuating.#Misc-exposition*]

[@So far, eleven species of Phoma studied in culture have been classified in section Hetero-
spora. They have been connected with nine Stagonosporopsis synanamorphs in vivo, mostly
originally described as Ascochyta species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The American, seed-borne pathogen of lupins treated in this supplement to section Herero-
spora was formerly also classified in Ascochyta (Boerema, 1984), as A. lupini Boerema &
R. Schneid. The original drawings of the conidia made by Dr. Roswitha Schneider (BBA,
Berlin-Dahlem)* show large, septate conidia in vitro, which argues for the classification in
Ascochyta. However, this has appeared to be exceptional: a fresh isolate (1998) as well as
the preserved isolates made by Dr. Schneider produce mainly relatively small, aseptate coni-
dia in vitro. In addition, in a letter dated 1-11-1978, Dr. Schneider had already noted the#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution. This fungus is a specific, seed-borne pathogen of lupins, causing
spots on leaves, stems and pods, and also occurring on roots. In South America, it is a serious
problem in the cultivation of L. mutabilis (Frey & Yabar, 1983), while in North America it
has been regularly found on perennial Lupinus spp. (e.g. Jones, 1942, Gordon, 1944 &
Savile, 1947). In Europe, this fungus used to be known only from occasional findings on
L. arboreus in England, but it has recently been isolated from the economically more impor-
tant L. albus as well. The fungus occurred in January 1998 on autumn-sown white lupins
cv. ‘Lucyane’ in Cambridgeshire, associated initially with leaf spots on cotyledons and pro-
gressing to cause leaf dieback and a stem base rot. The disease caused death of groups of
plants within the crop. In view of this, the fungus should be regarded as a potentially dan-
gerous organism to the cultivation of L. albus in continental Europe.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita dryophila belongs to the section Vaginatae (Fr.) Quél. and, within this section,
can be included in the complex of species with broadly ellipsoid to elongate spores. It shows
à very close resemblance to A. beckeri Huijsman (1959, sub *A. strangulata', 1961, 1962)
with which it is often confused on the field. Amanita dryophila is remarkably different from
this taxon, the most typical species of subsection /nauratae (M. Bon) Sebek with a white
(not grey) universal veil, because of its broadly ellipsoid (not spherical) larger spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the similar European species with a semifriable universal veil and broadly
ellipsoid to ellipsoid spores, A. dryophila has to be compared with A. oblongispora Tulloss
& Contu in Tulloss (1994) and with A. malleata (M. Bon) Contu (see Piane, 1972; Bon,
1983; Migliozzi & Lavorato, 1987; Tulloss, 1994), the only species which, growing in
similar habitats, could be confused with A. dryophila in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, A. oblongispora is very different from A. dryophila, as it has clamped basidia
as well as markedly more elongate spores (Q = 1.2-1.5) and a cap with grey or ochraceous
grey, sometimes buff or fawn, tints, but with hazel-brown or orange shades completely
lacking. Moreover, the ecology of A. oblongispora is less restricted than that of A. dryophila
as the former also grows well on acid soils where the latter has never been found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Also A, malleata has grey to whitish grey colours. Moreover, the lectotype designated
by Tulloss has gills with a pink tint and a subhymenium not composed of branching hyphae
as in A. dryophila (cf. Tulloss, 1994: 352).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita dryophila is very different from A. biovigera Sing., sometimes considered con-
specific with A. mairei Foley (cf. Fraiture, 1993: 91), which has a cap with much deeper
brown bistre to olivaceous bistre colours and a stem flecked with brown bistre, zigzag zones
(for the micromorphology. see Tulloss, 1994: 352—353) and from A. /ividopallescens var.
malleata (Piane ex) Romagn. with grey ochre to pearl-grey tints and a universal veil with a
filamentous texture (Romagnesi, 1982).#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTULAE AD FLORAM AGARICINAM NEERLANDICAM - XXXV
On the typification of Lactarius necator#Misc-exposition*]

[@MACHIEL E. NOORDELOOS! & THOMAS W. KUYPER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius necator is neotypified with a collection from Sweden that fits well with the
sanctioning description. The plate of Bulliard representing the original concept of Agari-
cus necator, is excluded from the type diagnosis. It is demonstrated that A. plumbeus is
not conspecific with A. necator, and the alternative use of the name Lactarius plumbeus
(Bull.: Fr.) Gray, as recently proposed by Heilmann-Clausen et al. (1998) is rejected.#Abstract*]

[@Recently, the first author started revising the genus Lactarius for one of the forthcoming
volumes of the Flora agaricina neerlandica. During this study also some nomenclatural prob-
lems were encountered, one of them being the application of the epithet necator for the
well-known and widespread species with olivaceous-brown colours, associated mainly with
Betula. In the current literature, this species has been called either L. necator or L. turpis,
and occasionally, mainly in the French tradition, also L. plumbeus. Heilmann-Clausen
et al. (1998), being aware of the problems connected with the typification of Lactarius neca-
tor also decided to use the name Lactarius plumbeus in their monograph of Nordic Lactarii.
The present paper makes clear that the name L. necator can be maintained and points out
that the name L. plumbeus should not be used for that taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although Fries had seen the fungus in living condition — as indicated by *'v.v." in his
description, he largely based this diagnosis on earlier descriptions (Fries, 1815: 59—69;
Persoon, 1799: 42; Persoon, 1801: 435).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is clear from these descriptions that Fries and Persoon described a Lactarius species,
nowadays commonly known as L. necator (Bull.: Fr.) Pers. However, it is remarkable that
Fries and Persoon chose the epithet necator Bull. for this species. Bulliard published two
plates as Agaricus necator. The first one, pl. 14, depicts (in the Leiden copy) a pinkish-red-
dish brown Lactarius species with zonate pileus and hairy pileal margin, obviously repre-
senting what we now are used to call Lactarius torminosus. Heilmann-Clausen et al. (1998:#Misc-exposition*]

[@43) who consulted another copy of Bulliard, mention a plate depicting a blackish fungus
with a hairy pileal margin. With Bulliard’s second plate (L.c., pl. 529, fig. 2) a fungus is
depicted which represents beyond any doubt L. torminosus. Fries (1821: 63) was aware of
the identity of the fungus illustrated again as Agaricus necator, as he listed that plate under
Agaricus torminosus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1832) realised that Persoon's and his own earlier interpretation of the first plate
of A. necator (Bull., pl. 14) might well have been wrong. He concluded that both Bulliard
plates referred to A. torminosus and he changed author attribution of the name A. necator,
listing it as A. necator Fr.! One might be tempted to conclude that Art. 48 is operative here
and that a new taxon, A. necator Fr.: Fr. was created, which was an illegitimate name, even
though sanctioned (Rauschert, 1989), but in view of Art. 7.8 and the taxonomic continuity
of A. necator between (1815) 1821 and 1832, such a conclusion would not be imperative.
Fries (1838), however, listed the same species as L. turpis (Weinm.) Fr. It is not clear why
he changed the name, but it might seem that it was a consequence of his earlier realisation
of the problems surrounding the application of the epithet necator. It is clear from Fries
(1874) that he did so for a very different reason: the species under discussion is considered
edible and even a delicacy, so that the epithet necator was clearly inept.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many later authors adopted L. turpis in that concept, to replace Agaricus necator (Ricken,
1910; Cooke, 1888; Lange, 1940; Neuhoff, 1956). In this century, however, also many au-
thors (Bon, 1980; Hesler & Smith, 1979; Imazeki & Hongo, 1988; Korhonen, 1984; Lundell
& Nannfeldt, 1935; Marchand, 1980; Moser, 1983; Rauschert, 1989; Ryman & Holmasen,
1992) retained the use of Lactarius necator in the concept of Fries (1815, 1821).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1821) sanctioned Agaricus plumbeus Bull. His description fits well with the original
description and plate of Bulliard (pl. 282, 559 fig. 2 and Hist. Champ. 2: 489—491). Agaricus
plumbeus Bull.: Fr. stands for a species with a uniformly coloured, not or hardly zoned.
dark grey to grey-brown, smooth, more or less viscid pileus with naked margin, lamellae
that turn ochre-vellow, and a stipe concolorous or slightly paler than the pileus. As such it
does not remind of L. necator in its current concept, but more likely it is a species close to
either L. pyrogalus or one of the group of L. fuliginosus. Fries adds in his description that
the stipe may have an olivaceous-reticulate surface, which may have misled later authors
to interpret it as a form of £L. necator. It is not clear what Agaricus plumbeus sensu Fries
1821 stands for, but it certainly does not represent the current concept of L. necator. This is
also indicated by Dennis et al. (1960: 95). Fries (1838) placed Agaricus plumbeus in sect.
Piperati with about the same concept as in 1821.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Quélet (1872) described Lactarius turpis in a concept similar to that of Fries (].c.), and
also used the name L. plumbeus Bull. for a species close to L. pyrogalus, differing from
that species mainly by the red-brown tot blackish brown pileus and white then yellow lamel-
lae. Later, Quélet (1886), however, abandoned this concept of L. plumbeus, and gave a new
description, which fits well with Agaricus turpis Weinm., which is mentioned in the synony-
my. It becomes not clear, however, why Quélet changed his mind about the interpretation
of Agaricus plumbeus. Quélet was followed by several French authors. e.g. Konrad &
Maublanc (1937) and Blum (1976). Recently, Heilmann-Clausen et al. ( 1998) also became
aware of the discrepancy between the sanctioning description of Agaricus necator and the
original plate of Bulliard. They considered the original plate more important than the
sanctioning description of L. necator, and therefore proposed the use of the name Lactarius
plumbeus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Noordeloos & Kuyper: Notulae ad Floram agaricinam neerlandicam — XXXV 293#Page-header*]

[@From the above discussion it will be clear that there are three good reasons to disagree
with the reintroduction of the name Lactarius plumbeus to replace L. necator, viz. the identity
of A. plumbeus Bull., the identity of A. plumbeus Bull.: Fr., and the identity of L. plumbeus
(Bull.: Fr.) Quél.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another question is whether Lactarius necator is in need of replacement because of the
questionable identity of plate 14 of Bulliard (the identity of the other plate is irrelevant).
The present code (Greuter et al., 1994), explicitly allows us to choose from the sanctioning
description those elements that fit with the current concept of a species. In the case of
Agaricus necator this can be done by accepting the diagnosis of Fries (1821), taxonomically
excluding the cited plate 14 of Bulliard. The current use of the name Lactarius necator can
be fixed with a neotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There might seem to be one problem with this procedure, viz. the apparent contradiction
between Art. 48 (explicit exclusion of types) and Art. 7.8 (typification criteria for sanctioned
names). If the latter article (and hence nomenclatural stability) is to function well, it should
take precedence over Art. 48. For that reason the name should be cited as follows:#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTULAE AD FLORAM AGARICINAM NEERLANDICAM - XXXVI
Tricholoma#Misc-exposition*]

[@MORTEN CHRISTENSEN! & MACHIEL E. NOORDELOOS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Tricholoma contains several taxonomically difficult groups. During the revi-
sion of the genus Tricholoma for the Flora agaricina neerlandica, vol. 4 (Bas et al., in
press) some of these groups have been tackled. Detailed studies are presented of sect.
Lasciva and sect. Atrosquamosa subsect. Terrea with keys, descriptions, and comments.
Where possible neotypes or epitypes have been designated. In addition two new varieties
are described in other sections, viz. Tricholoma psammopus var. macrosporum and T.
equestre var. populinum. Notes are given on some nomenclatural problems within the
genus Tricholoma.#Abstract*]

[@Like in several other genera of Agaricales the application of species-names in Tricholoma
is often based on old and usually short diagnoses. Types are often missing and current usage
of names is often primarily based on mycological tradition and personal observations by
the various authors. Confusion and misunderstanding of the original diagnosis and plates
have often led to different concepts in different books and/or different parts of Europe. In
an attempt to solve some of these problems lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated
for some species where no proper type material exists or is represented only with an icon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The descriptions given in this paper and in the Flora agaricina neerlandica (Noordeloos
& Christensen, 1999) are based on personal observations of newly collected material and
on studies of herbarium specimens. Field observations on Tricholoma species were made
in Denmark and The Netherlands as well as during field trips in Norway, Sweden, Great
Britain, France, Germany, Austria and Italy. Herbarium specimens were studied primarily
from the Rijkherbarium in Leiden (L), but also from the Botanical Museum in Copenhagen
(C), University of Oulu (OULU) and Natural Museum in Lugano (LUG), focussing on
microscopical structures such as size and shape of spores and pileipellis structures. The
average spore size presented in the diagrams (Figs. 1, 2) are based on at least 10 representa-
tive spores from each collection measured in 35% KOH. Drawings of microscopical struc-
tures have been made with a drawing-tube on a Leica microscope. The terminology and
abbreviations in this paper follow Bas et al. (1988).#Misc-exposition*]

[@radish, strong perfume or strongly scented flowers, and the frequent occurrence of clamp-
connections in the pileipellis and pileitrama. Although the members of this section are rela-
lively easy to recognize as a whole, species concept and delimitation appears to be rather
difficult. In this paper the authors have tried to present well-delimited species, focussing
on characters like spore size and -shape, frequency of clamp-connections, colour and discol-
ouration of fruiting bodies, and smell. Concepts have also been fixed with lectotypes or
neotypes. Confusion may also occur with other white or pale Tricholoma species from other
sections, viz. Tricholoma inamoenum (Fr.: Fr.) Gillet (sect. /namoena) which has very distant
lamellae and very large spores (9.0 —12.0 x 6.0 -7.5 µm). Confusion may also occur with
pale forms of Tricholoma saponaceum (sect. Saponacea), but the smell of that species is
normally different and rather weak, reminiscent of cheap nonperfumed soap. and the context
stains often slightly reddish. Tricholoma columbetta (sect. Albata) is a pure white species
which can be distinguished by the radially fibrillose structure of the pileus, mild taste and
often by the blue or reddish spots in older basidiocarps. Tricholoma albidum (sect. Albida)
has a similar radially fibrillose pileus but is smaller than 7; columbetta, and stains yellow.
Even Tricholoma acerbum (sect. Imbricata) may be confused with members of sect. Lasciva,
but the more brownish colour, the very crowded lamellae, the lack of smell and the very
small spores distinguish it easily.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma album is generally smaller and more regularly shaped than T. stiparophyllum.
and has distant, rather thick and irregular lamellae. The lamellae and lamellulae are of
unequal width. It occurs mainly under Quercus. Tricholoma album var. thalliophilum differs
by staining blue-green with thalliumoxide and sulfoformol (Bon, 1970). Since there are
hardly any other morphological differences between var. thalliophilum and the typical
variety, we do not attach much taxonomic value to it. Tricholoma lascivum differs by the
more elongate spores and more frequent clamp-connections in pilei-, stipitipellis, and hyme-
nium, Tricholoma resplendens (Fr.) P. Karst. sensu P. Karst. (1879) is likely misapplied for
T. album, but the original description by Fries (1857) may refer to any species in section
Lasciva or even to T. columbetta (Fr.) Kumm. It is consequently considered a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma stiparophyllum is distinguished from T. album by the larger fruit-bodies,
the irregular pileus often with costate margin, the more regularly shaped, crowded lamellae,
and its occurrence with Betula, Tricholoma lascivum has a more greyish-yellowish tinge
in the pileus, distinctly larger spores, and occurs mainly with Fagus on rich soil. Agaricus
stiparophyllus clearly refers to a large species with whitish-yellowish pileus, resembling
T. acerbum, with strong smell and acrid taste. It is originally described from the Stockholm
region. Karsten (1879) adopted it in the same concept as Tricholoma stiparophyllum (Fr.)
P. Karst. From the original diagnosis there is no doubt that this is the same fungus described
by Bon (1970) as T. pseudoalbum and as Tricholoma album by Lange (1935). Judging from
the original diagnosis, Tricholoma raphanicum P. Karst. may also be synonymous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma lascivum is very similar to T. album in many respects, particularly in the
general habit with rather thick, irregular, distant lamellae. The colour of the pileus, however,
has a distinct pale greyish component, and the spores are definitely longer and more elongate.
In exsiccata the lamellae have a rather dark greyish-brownish tinge, whereas those of Tricho-
loma album are normally paler in exsiccata. It is assumed that some records from the Nether-
lands of T. inamoenum from deciduous woodland actually represent T. lascivum, but this
could not be confirmed because well-annotated collections were not available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma sulphurescens is well-characterized by the quick yellow staining of the
basidiocarps when touched, the yellow context, the initially smooth pileus, the rather crowd-
ed lamellae and the floccose to squamulose stipe, in combination with subglobose to broadly
ellipsoid spores. Tricholoma sulphureum has overall yellow colours, more distant lamellae
and much larger, oblong spores and a very characteristic nauseous smell. The name Gyro-
phila resplendens has been used for T. sulphurescens (Quélet, 1888). but the original descrip-
tion of Agaricus resplendens (Fries, 1857) does not mention the strong yellow staining which
is the most obvious macroscopical character (see comments under T. album). It is likely
that the name Tricholoma impolitum (Lasch) Gillet also has been used for T. sulphurescens.
According to the original description, however, Tricholoma impolitum does not belong to
sect. Lasciva, but probably refers to a species close to, or even synonymous with T. acerbum.
Also the name Tricholoma saponaceum var. cnista Lange has been misused for T. sul-
phurescens, but that taxon is characterised by a slight reddish and not yellow staining of
the basidiocarp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma terreum is a rather variable species. Several taxa have been recognized, main-
ly on account of the structure of the pileipellis, the shape and colour of the pileus and the
presence or absence of veil, which prove to be similar. Zricholoma myomyces sensu Clémen-
con (1983) and Bon (1991) is characterized by only one or two layers of isodiametrical
cells in the pileipellis in contrast to three or more in T. terreum. But according to our
observations the number of layers in the pileipellis is very variable and also depends on the
age of the basidiocarps and ecological and climatical conditions. The shape of the pileus in
Tricholoma myomyces is described as more or less convex contrasting with a more or less
conical pileus in T. terreum. The illustrations of 7richoloma myomyces (Lange, 1935; Mar-
chand, 1986; Riva, 1988) do not support these differences and our observations from fresh
collection frequently show a rather continuous range of pileal shapes from conical or cam-
panulate to convex, in basidiocarps from one mycelium. The same applies to the colour of
the pileus, ranging from rather pale grey to deep greyish-black, connected with the varia-
tion found in the microscopy of the pileipellis. Another character used in the literature to
distinguish Tricholoma myomyces from T. terreum is the presence (T. myomyces) or absence
(T. terreum) of a fibrillose cortinate veil as white, fibrillose, arachnoid patches along the
margin of the pileus, and a fibrillose annuliform zone on the stipe. Our studies show a rather
big variation in the occurrence of veil. In many collections veil was observed in very young
basidiocarps or primordia, but it may disappear completely in the course of development.
Presence of veil remnants in mature basidiocarps did not seem to be correlated with any of
the other distinguishing characters mentioned for Tricholoma myomyces and T. terreum.
Therefore, it was decided to consider Tricholoma myomyces as a synonym of T. terreum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma gausapatum (Fr.) Quél. as conceived by Huijsman (1968) and Bon (1976,
1991) differs from T. terreum by the woolly-plushy, not squamulose surface of the pileus,
which may also have a more brown-grey tinge, the greyish-glaucous tinge of the lamellae.
and the fugacious fibrillose annuliform zone on the stipe. According to Clémengon (1983)
Tricholoma gausapatum is also characterized by clamps or pseudoclamps in the hymenium,
So far we have not studied any material that matches this concept of T. gausapatum. It
seems to be a very rare species, restricted to southern Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma triste — as presented here — agrees with the rather short original diagnosis of
Scopoli (1772). As such, it also fits well within the concept of Bresadola (1927). It is distin-
guished from Tricholoma terreum mainly by the large and slender spores, the smaller size
of the basidiocarps and the blackish squarrulose stipe. Tricholoma triste sensu M. Bon (1984,
1991) has smaller spores, a fibrillose, not squamulose stipe and a less differentiated pilei-
pellis. This taxon seems to be a transition between stirps Terreum and stirps Scalpturatum,
and may even be a variant of Tricholoma scalpturatum. Bon (1995) states that Tricholoma
scalpturatum var. atrocinctum Romagn. (1974) represents a kind of intermediate form
between T. scalpturatum and T. triste, but according to our species concept this variety
seems to be more related to T. argyraceum (see below).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma scalpturatum is used here in a narrow sense. It remains a rather variable
species, however, with the colour of the pileus ranging from grey-brown to blackish grey.
The pileus is darker than in T. argyraceum and normally more convex and without an acute
papilla which is characteristic for T. argyraceum. The most important distinguishing char-
acter, however, is found in the rather broad spores with an average Q less than 1.5. Tricho-
loma cingulatum is very similar, differs mainly by its well-developed, woolly fibrillose
annulus on the stipe. Tricholoma scalpturatum var. atrocinctum Romagn. has a blackish
fringed annuliform zone, which occasionally also has been observed in T. cingulatum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma psammopus is characterized by its moderately dark, reddish brown, very
finely tomentose, granulose-punctuate to finely floccose pileus and stipe, and lack of smell.
It occurs widespread in Europe in association with Larix, particularly in mountainous regions
and on rich, often calcareous soil. However, it has also been found sometimes in association
with Pinus. Bon (1984) reports also association with Abies and Picea, From the Netherlands
only two collections are known, one from the coastal dune-area, collected under Pinus on
calcareous sand, and one from an inland locality on loamy-sandy soil, without indication
of accompanying trees. Both collections deviate from the current concept of Tricholoma
psammopus (Bon, 1991; Riva, 1988) by having larger spores, that are born on 4-spored
basidia. Tricholoma psammopus forma bisporum M. Bon has similar spores, born on 2-
spored basidia, however, but grows also in association with Pinus (Bon, 1984). Considering
the differences in basidia, it seems best, however, to keep forma bisporum separate from
var. macrosporum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I. On the names Agaricus fulvus and A. ustale#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name Agaricus fulvus was used by Bulliard (17922), first in connection with plate
555. fig. 2. Later Bulliard (1792b) published a second icon of the same species (pl. 574).
From the descriptions with the plates in the later reissue of the plates (Bulliard 1809: 608)#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma fulvum or T. flavobrunneum with a distinct yellow tinge in the context of stipe
and lamellae, growing with Betula. Plate 574 clearly depicts 7: ustale (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm. in
its current use, with whitish context, lamellae white then pale yellow, with brown spots,
etc., associated with Fagus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1821: 37) sanctioned the name A. fulvus Bull., referring to both plates of Bulliard.
In his diagnosis, Fries stressed the yellowing of the context of the stipe as an important
character to distinguish it from A. albobrunneus and A. ustalis. It is clear that in this concept.
A. fulvus Bull.: Fr. is the same as the current use of Tricholoma fulvum or, as it is also gener-
ally called, T. flavobrunneum (Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Christensen & Noordeloos: Notulae ad floram agaricinam neerlandicam — XXXVI 313#Page-header*]

[@Fries (1821: 37) included Agaricus flavobrunneus Fr. (1818) in the synonymy of Agaricus
fulvus. Judging from the diagnosis of A. flavobrunneus, Fries was completely right in
accepting this synonymy. However, he did not cite Bulliards plate 555, fig. 2 for A. flavo-
brunneus, but Bulliard pl. 574, fig. 1! Since Agaricus flavobrunneus has tiot been sanctioned
by Fries, it seems appropriate to accept it as a synonym of A. fulvus, excluding the cited
plate of Bulliard. From the diagnosis it seems also very likely that Agaricus nictitans Fr.:
Fr., (1821) is a synonym of A. fulvus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1821) also describes Agaricus ustalis Fr.: Fr., characterized by a red-brown, viscid,
glabrous pileus, white lamellae, and a stipe with glabrous apex, fibrillose-squamulose in
lower part, growing under Fagus as well as Betula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, confusion starts when Fries (1838) completely reconsidered the taxonomy of
this group of species. He abandoned Agaricus fulvus, obviously considering it a nomen
confusum, connected with the name Agaricus rufus in various interpretations. A new species
was described as Agaricus fulvellus Fr., referring to Bulliards plate 555. fig. 2. In his descrip-
tion, however, Fries does not mention any yellow tinges in the context of stipe, nor in the
colour of the lamellae. It is said to grow under Fagus in S Sweden, and the description
therefore most likely refers to the current concept of 7richoloma ustale (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm.
The description of Agaricus nictitans Fr. was emended to include Bulliard's plate 574,
fig. 1, and might therefore refer to Agaricus ustalis. Fries redescribed in this publication
also Agaricus flavobrunneus Fr. (1818). as a common species from Betula forest with a
red-brown, virgate-squamulose, viscid pileus, deeply emarginate, yellow lamellae that stain
reddish with age. and a stipe which is slightly viscid when moist, with naked apex. and
fibrillose lower part. Fries indicates that Agaricus rufus sensu Fr. (1821: 37) is a synonym
of A. flavobrunneus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally, Fries (1838) gives a new description of Agaricus ustalis, characterized by a red-
brown, glabrous, viscid pileus, white lamellae which stain reddish when old, and a stipe
with naked apex, reddish fibrillose below, growing in mountainous Pinus forest.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tricholoma suffocatum Richon. & Roze (1888) 81, represents an older synonym of
T. populinum J. Lange (1933) and should be used instead. In fact, Lange (1935) was aware
of the possibility that his T. populinum was a synonym of T. suffocatum. However, the older
name has never been used in modern literature. Most authors (Bon, 1984,1991; Breitenbach
& Krünzlin, 1991; Courtecuisse & Duhem, 1994; Gulden, 1992; Marchand, 1986; Moser,
1983; Riva, 1988) use the name Tricholoma populinum. Therefore a formal proposal has
been made to conserve the name 7: populinum in favour of T. suffocatum. Awaiting the
decision of the nomenclature committee of the International Botanic Congress, we continue
the use of the name 7: populinum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. Tricholoma albobrunneum versus T. striatum#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species around Tricholoma albobrunneum are all characterized by a more or less
red-brown, viscid pileus, white lamellae, and a stipe which may have a distinctly delimited
white apical zone or not. Several species have been distinguished in this group, but there is
still confusion, in particular with regard to the interpretation of old names.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus striatus Schaeff. (1762, pl. 38) is depicted as a fungus which clearly belongs
to this group. Persoon (1801: 293) describes Agaricus albobrunneus Pers. referring to A.
striatus Schaeff., which he considers a synonym. Fries (1821: 37) sanctioned the name
Agaricus albobrunneus Pers. and confirms the synonymy of Agaricus striatus Schaeff.,
but Fries specifically states that the plate of Schaeffer is not representative. Since the name
Agaricus albobrunneus has been sanctioned, we use that name for our interpretation of
Persoon's taxon. Furthermore, from a taxonomical point of view, the synonymy of Agaricus
striatus Schaeff. is questionable, as it may represent another species in the same group.

[@4. Tricholoma equestre versus T. flavovirens#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus equestre L. 1772: 12is sanctioned by Fries (1821). Although Linnaeus described
a rather unspecific taxon, the sanctioning description is rather unambiguous. Following
the advise of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Greuter et al., 1994) we
use therefore the name Tricholoma equestre (L.: Fr.) Kumm. in favour of T. flavovirens
Pers.: Fr., although the latter also has been sanctioned by Fries in 1821.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. Agaricus luteovirens versus T. apium#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus luteovirens A. & S. (1805: 168) has been interpreted as a species of Floccularia
(Pouzar, 1957; Pilát, 1969; Bon, 1991). According to the original diagnosis this could well
be true. Kreisel (1987), however, concluded from the original description that the name
Agaricus luteovirens A. & S.: Fr. must be considered an older synonym of Tricholoma apium
Schaeff. However, since Albertini & Schweinitz (1805), nor Fries (1821) in the sanctioning
description refer to the very characteristic celery-like smell of Tricholoma apium, we do
not follow Kreisel (1987), and continue the use of the name Tricholoma apium for the species
in question.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. Tricholoma batschii versus T. fracticum#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus subannulatus Batsch is typified by a description and plate that can be identified
without problems as the Tricholoma species currently known as T. batschii Gulden. Gulden
(1969) created this new name for T. subannulatus (Batsch) Bres., because it is a later
homonym of T. subannulatus (Peck) Zeller. Unfortunately, the new name was not valid
according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, because Gulden did not
mention the basionym, nor presented a diagnosis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kreisel (1984) considered Agaricus fracticus Britzelmayr (1885; pl. 568) as conspecific
with T. batschii, and recombined the epithet of Britzelmayr in Tricholoma. The present
authors, however, disagree with the synonymy proposed by Kreisel (1984). Britzelmayr's
plate does not show the sharply delimited white apical zone of the stipe, which is the main
characteristic for T. batschii. It therefore likely represents another species in the group of
T. albobrunneum. We therefore validate Guldens binomial.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is the fourth edition of a well-known illustrated key to the *Fungi imperfecti', often
used in elementary courses of mycology. The keys and classification used are still based
on the fully artificial, but very practical and easy system proposed by Saccardo (1886, 1906)
and Lindau (1900). The present authors do not believe the time has come to shift to a new
system for the identification of *form-genera’ of these fungi by the student. An alternative
set of keys, based on the Hughes-Tubaki-Barron system of classification, is added and uses
characters primarily based on the development of the conidia. The convention by hypho-
mycete specialists (Kananaskis, 1969) to standardize the categories and terms to allow accu-
rate description of the conidium ontogeny is not followed here. In this edition a new
introduction is included, with several additions of new genera and 60 new references since
the former edition (1972). The illustrations are about the same with some rearrangements
and additions. Only the print is now much darker, leaving details in the dark parts unresolved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This volume contains the compiled descriptions and illustrations of a series of 100 genera’
of ascomycetes, additional to the 100 of the first volume, entitled "Illustrated genera of
ascomycetes’, published in 1990 by the same author. The spiral-bound booklet consists for
the main part of the generic descriptions and the accompanying illustrations. The genera
treated are chosen rather arbitrarily from a very wide range of ascomycetes, such as yeasts,
Taphrinales, unitunicate and bitunicate pyrenomycetes, operculate and inoperculate disco-
mycetes, Laboulbeniales, and lichenized groups. Cleistohymenial plectomycetes and hemi-
ascomycetes are not included. The arrangement is on the basis of the over a century old
Saccardoan system of spore types (like hyalosporae, allantosporae, phaeosporae, hyalo-
didymae, phaeodidymae, etc.) and types of ascoma. This leads to a completely artificial
arrangement, with e.g. a group of *hyalosporae’, including together genera like Saccharo-
myces, Taphrina, Amauroascus, Bisporella, Cookeina, Cyttaria, Otidea, Cladonia, Colpoma,
etc. A dichotomous key using artificial characters is provided for the identification of the
hundred genera of this second volume, without considering the genera included in the first
volume. The work is meant for students with little knowledge of fungi and should provide
means for easy identification. But the artificial keys and arrangement will not learn the stu-
dent much about relationships and relevant structures of genera of ascomycetes. The main
value of this book is in the rather consistent generic descriptions and the clear, somewhat
stylized and diagrammatic illustrations. References are made mainly to handbooks and
flora's, but modern monographs of the genera treated are rarely cited.#Misc-exposition*]

volumes were restricted to the hundred genera included, the author felt the need of a new
key to the 200 genera of both volumes. An alternative key on more natural characters is
missing. Following the key is a section containing corrections and additions to the first
volume (1990). Especially nomenclatural changes and additional information is provided
for the earlier descriptions. More recent references are listed. Special attention has been
paid to the terminology, with three diagrams on types of spores and tissues, and a more

[@The project for an extensive list of the fungi of Saxonia is of long standing. It started in
1916, but was interrupted several times. Most progress was made during the previous two
decennia. The area covered is the German Province of Saxonia with its political boundaries
of 1997. It has been subdivided in eight geographical regions. The groups of fungi included
depend on the specialists available in the region. In total 3,833 species of 816 genera are
listed. Especially Myxomycota (195 species), *macromycetes' (c. 2,600 species), terrestrial
Oomycota, phytopathogenic fungi (Peronosporales, Erysyphales, Uridinales, Ustilaginales),
and many orders of Pyrenomycetes are included. 'Micromycetes', Fungi imperfecti, and
lichens are omitted. The list is based on numerous field trips and publications on the local
myco-flora. The mycological collections of the herbaria of Dresden, Górlitz, and Leipzig
are screened. The historical herbarium collection of K.W. Krieger (1885-1919) ‘Fungi Sax-
onici' is incorporated in the present work. Many mycologists collected extensively in
Saxonia and published on its fungi, e.g. B. Auerswald, J. B. von Albertini & L.D. von
Schweinitz, E. H. Benedix, D. Benkert, R. Buch, P. Dietel, W. Dietrich, H. Dórfelt, I. Dunger,
P. Ebert, O. Frómelt, H.-J. Hardtke, K. Herschel, H. Kreisel, K. W. Krieger, P. Otto,
E. Pieschel, L. Rabenhorst, R. Rauschert, and P. Sydow. For each species listed the following
information is given: the correct name, important synonyms, frequency, habitat, geographical
region(s) within Saxonia, localities with geometrical grid, and eventual literature references.
Of taxa described as new from Saxonia reference is made to the type and the type locality.
It is a thorough mycological inventory of an important part of central Europe. From the lit-
erature consulted and the names used it can be concluded that the main part was already
finished about ten years before publication.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first volume of this monograph is an impressive hard-cover book with a large number
of very high quality, well-reproduced photographs. It is the first European monograph on
the genus Russula since the magistral work of Romagnesi (1967). The book gives an
extensive introduction on the characters of the genus, including 25 (!) pages on ecology,
and a long discussion on the infrageneric taxonomy. The taxonomic part gives keys and
descriptions of about 100 taxa, with discussions, coloured photographs and microscopical
drawings of high quality. The nomenclature is brought up to date with the help of the French
specialist G. Redeuilh. References are not given, and will be listed in the second and final
part of the monograph. The keys are not always strictly dichotomic, and in quite a few
cases the couplets are not clearly giving opposite character states, which makes identification
sometimes difficult. However, the long and detailed descriptions and good illustrations facil-
itate identification. Species concepts seem to be rather large, in contrast to those of some
contemporary French authors (Bon, Reumaux). The conclusion is that we have a very good
modern European monograph with this work of Sarnari, that is highly recommended,
although the Italian language may form a difficulty for many users. Fortunately the keys
are also given in English. It is recommended that the author gives an extensive English
summary in the second volume of this series, which will certainly increase the number of
users. We look forward to volume 2.#Misc-exposition*]
