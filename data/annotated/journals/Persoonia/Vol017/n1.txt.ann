[@ON THE IDENTITY OF THE NEW TAXA OF GALERINA (AGARICALES),
PROVISIONALLY DESCRIBED BY J.J. BARKMAN!#Misc-exposition*]

[@EEF ARNOLDS & BERNHARD DE VRIES#Misc-exposition*]
[@Biological Station, Centre of Soil Ecology, Kampsweg 27, 9418 PD Wijster, The Netherlands#Institution*]

[@Descriptions are presented of thirteen species and five varieties of Galerina, provisionally
described as new by the Dutch mycologist JJ. Barkman in 1969 and 1970. The descrip-
tions and illustrations are based on the original descriptive notes and our own study of
microscopic characters. The study was hampered by the poor condition of most exsiccata,
Nevertheless, the majority of the provisional taxa could be identified as belonging to
species described before.#Abstract*]

[@Four provisional species could not be identified with certainty, but they show so much
resemblance to existing species that there is no reason to consider them as new taxa.
One provisional species, G. anomala, is strongly deviating from other Galerina species
and does probably not belong to that genus. Its identity remains unknown, In addition,
our study revealed useful information on the taxonomic significance and variability of
some diagnostic characters in Galerina,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Jan Barkman was a Dutch ecologist and phytosociologist with special interest for cryptogams
in vegetation science. He introduced the discipline of mycosociology in the Netherlands
and made it flourish (Barkman, 1976a, 1987). Together with his assistant B. de Vries he
carried out extensive mycosociological studies in juniper scrubs in north-western and central
Europe, of which only parts of the results have been published (Barkman, 1976b; de Vries,
1973, 1976; de Vries & Arnolds, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@During this research he developed a special interest in the small brown-spored agarics
of the genus Galerina Earle, at that time a strongly neglected group in Europe. Juniper
scrubs appeared to be a particularly rich habitat for these fungi. In 1969 Barkman published
a survey of the genus Galerina in the Netherlands in the form of a key with short descriptions
and drawings of microscopical characters. Although this publication was written in Dutch,
the paper has also been used and quoted by foreign European agaricologists (e.g. Bon, 1992;
Watling & Gregory, 1993). In his 1969 paper Barkman described also 17 taxa as provi-
sionally new, deliberately without a Latin diagnosis or reference to (type) collections. In
1970 he added some comments to his earlier survey and he again introduced one new
provisional species without formal description. In the herbarium of the Biological Station
at Wijster (WBS) several other collections are present with a provisional name on the label,
which have never been published in any paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Barkman died unexpectedly in 1990, without having validly published any of his Galerina
taxa. In this paper we attempt to clarify the identity of the taxa, provisionally described as
new in Barkman's 1969 and 1970 papers, based on our re-examination of the collections at
Wijster and the extensive notes by Barkman on the fresh sporocarps. We have not yet stud-
ied the taxa which were not described in his papers, but indicated as new on herbarium#Misc-exposition*]

[@labels only. In some cases collections are also available, which were identified by other
persons as belonging to one of Barkman's provisional species. In general we did not examine
these collections either. All collections cited are preserved in WBS.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The investigation of the exsiccata of Galerina was hampered by two main problems.
First, many collections remained after collecting in the refrigerator for some days, sometimes
over one week, before they were examined (communication by B. de Vries). Therefore
many sporocarps have been studied and preserved in bad condition and in some cases we
observed evidently abnormal mis-shaped spores, apparently due to a long stay in the
refrigerator. Secondly, the collections were dried in a closed stove without sufficient air
circulation at 40°C. By this practice the sporocarps were more cooked than dried and in
many exsiccata (almost) all cystidia and cells of other tissues were collapsed. It was often
very difficult to find undamaged cystidia and pileipellis structures, even after boiling
fragments of the tissues in KOH 5%.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The results of our studies are presented according to the names used by Barkman (1969,
1970) in alphabetical order. Each taxon is described and drawings of diagnostic features
are given. The description of macroscopic characters is mainly based on Barkman’s
annotations on the fresh sporocarps. Four different colour codes were used by him, viz.
Séguy (1936), Cailleux & Taylor (without year, in the text indicated as Expo), Kornerup &
Wanscher (1978, in the text indicated as K & W) and Munsell (1954). The microscopic
characters are derived from our own study of the exsiccata and, when useful, supplemented
by observations made by Barkman on the fresh sporocarps. In our comments we compare
the characteristics, as noted by Barkman and observed by us, and we try to find an appropriate
valid name for the provisionally described taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From our study it becomes evident that Barkman's species concept around 1969 was
still immature. Collections, labelled with the same provisional name, appear often to belong
to several species and sometimes also within a single collection more than one species was
found to be present. Most newly introduced names were in our opinion given to atypical or
aberrant specimens of widespread, variable species. Only two provisional names in
Barkman's publications, viz. G. dunensis and G. fellea, are considered to represent new
species, not described at that time. In the meantime the two species have been formally de-
scribed already as G. caulocystidiata Arnolds and G. beatricis Bas, respectively. One other
provisional species, G. anomala, is strongly deviating in many respects and does probably
not belong to the genus Galerina. Its identity remains unsolved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Our study of these collections has learnt us that some characters in Galerina are more
variable or less prominent than often assumed. No less than six provisional taxa contained
collections or specimens assigned by us to G. allospora Smith & Sing., whereas G. hypnorum
was represented in the material of five provisional taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collection comprises two sporocarps in rather bad condition. Besides the specimen
described above it contains a smaller sporocarp (pileus 5 mm, stipe 20 x 0.6 mm) with
amygdaliform spores, 8.5—1 1.0 x 5.5—6.5 µm, smooth with exosporal blisters near the plage
area. It is strongly deviating from the microscopical characters as described by Barkman
and evidently belongs to the section Calyptrospora, probably to G. calyptrata P.D. Orton.
The characters of the larger specimen agreed well with the annotations by Barkman.
Apparently the two species were confused in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The described fungus clearly belongs to stirps Sideroides of subsection Tibiicystidiae,
characterized by tibiiform cystidia and smooth spores. It comes very close to G. sideroides
and in Barkman's paper it keys out next to that species. The common diagnostic characters
are the absence of a well-developed veil (present in G. stylifera (Atk.) Smith & Sing.) and
the presence of a viscid, gelatinized pileipellis (absent in G. camerina (Fr.) Kühner). Bas
(1996) studied the pileipellis in this collection as well and confirmed the existence of a
clearly gelatinized layer (unpublished notes on collection). The present collection is slightly
deviating from typical G. sideroides as described by Smith & Singer (1964) in (1) small
dimensions of the sporocarp, (2) more acutely umbonate pileus, and (3) slightly smaller
basidia and spores than usual (according to Smith & Singer (1964) 20-40 x 7-8 µm and
7-8.5(-9) x 4-4.5 µm, respectively; according to Derbsch & Schmitt (1987) 25-30 x
6.5-7.5 µm and 6.7-8.2 x 4—4.5 µm). However, these differences are only gradual and we
believe that the studied collection still falls within the variation of G. sideroides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description by Barkman was based on a single minute sporocarp. At present half of
à fragmented sporocarp in bad condition remains.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Barkman's key G. aimaroides keys out in a group of species without pleurocystidia
and with cheilocystidia with a long, thin, often acute neck, side by side with G. uncialis. It
would be different from the latter species in lack of an annulate veil, entirely rugulose spores
(without plage), numerous hyphae without clamp-connections and special substrate.
However, we were able to demonstrate the presence of a smooth plage area in some spores
and found the clamps to be numerous. We also observed that the cystidia were less slender
than described and depicted by Barkman, and usually subcapitate. We do not think that
this fungus is closely related to G. uncialis, but to G. hvpnorum. Both of us observed
irregular, wrinkled exosporal blisters in a small proportion (« 1056) of the spores, a feature
characteristic of this species. However, the spores are relatively broad for G. hypnorum
and the cheilocystidia are relatively slender. Nevertheless we believe that this collection
represents an extreme variant of this quite variable species. The habitat on fern rhizomes is
peculiar, but G. hypnorum is known from wood, debris of various herbaceous plants and
bryophytes (Arnolds, 1983). The identity of this collection cannot be established with
certainty due to the bad condition of the extremely scanty material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collection examined. GERMANY: Westfalen, Eiffel, N. slope of Wiwwelsberg, on wood of Juniperus,

[@The three collections, described first, are in all respects similar to the widespread
2-spored form of G. atkinsoniana A.H. Smith, in particular in the presence of pileo- and
caulocystidia and size and ornamentation of spores. The only difference is the presence of
veil remains at the stipe and occasionally along the margin of the pileus. Likewise, the
fourth collection from Germany seems to be identical with G. vittaeformis (Fr.) Sing. except
for the presence of veil remnants. G. atkinsoniana and G. vittaeformis differ only in the
abundance, viz. absence or scarcity of pileocystidia. This character is, at least in some
regions, intergrading (Arnolds, 1983) and therefore G. atkinsoniana is regarded by some
authors as a subspecies (Arnolds, 1983) or variety (Kricglsteiner, 1991; Arnolds et al., 1995)
of G. vittaeformis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The significance of a veil in section Galerina is much disputed and the nomenclature of
veiled taxa is extremely confused. Smith & Singer (1964) regarded this character as quite
important since they divided section Galerina into two stirpes on this basis: stirps Minima
with remains of veil and stirps Vittaeformis without veil. We do not share this point of view
since the presence of a subtle veil is the only difference between several pairs of otherwise
identical taxa, placed in the two stirpes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Favre (1955) introduced the name G. rubiginosa var. annulata Favre for alpine collections
with an annulate zone on the stipe, 2- or 4-spored basidia and without pileocystidia. He
noticed that in typical G. rubiginosa, by us regarded as a synonym of G. vittaeformis, in
very young sporocarps rarely a weakly developed veil was observed (“un vague voile
cortiniforme trés fugace"). Kühner (1972) described 4-spored populations with distinct veil
as belonging to G. vittaeformis f. vittaeformis and discussed in extenso the significance of
that character, which was thought by him to be of no importance at all. On the other hand,
Gulden (1980) and Watling & Gregory (1993) treated such forms as species in their own#Misc-exposition*]

[@right and adopted the name G. terrestris Wells & Kempton, a species originally described
from Canada with 4-spored basidia (Wells & Kempton, 1969). Collection Barkman 9552
can be considered to belong to this taxon. A possible earlier synonym is G. subannulata
(Sing.) Smith & Sing. (= G. vittaeformis var. subannulata Sing., 1953), which may be
different, however, in the predominantly vesiculose cheilocystidia (Smith & Singer, 1964;
Singer, 1974). In addition the basidia in this taxon are 2- (some l- or 3-)spored, but we
think that the numbers of sterigmata on the basidia are of little or no importance in this
group. A related, but apparently distinct species is G. caulocystidia Arnolds, also with
2-spored basidia, a pruinose-pubescent stipe and a fibrillose veil, but characterized by
the absence of pleurocystidia (Arnolds, 1983; see also discussion on G. dunensis in this
paper).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections of the G. vittaeformis complex with both pileocystidia, caulocystidia and
veil remnants on the stipe are apparently less widespread. They were unknown to Gulden
(1980), and Kiihner (1972: 82) included only one collection from the Swiss alps with very
fine flocks at the stipe in his description of G. atkinsoniana f. atkinsoniana with 2-spored
basidia. On the other hand, Singer (1974) described a similar fungus from the Swiss alps
with predominantly 4-spored (some 2- and 3-spored) basidia as a separate species. He used
the name G. annulata (Favre) Sing., based on G. rubiginosa var. annulata Favre (1955),
although Favre described the pileipellis without mentioning the presence of pileocystidia,
as noticed also by Kühner (1972). Singer (1974) did not indicate whether he has examined
Favre's type collection with different results.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In our opinion, the taxonomic significance of the presence of a fibrillose velum in this
group of fungi is very doubtful since the degree of development varies considerably. De
Vries noted on the label of his collection 793 of *G. annulata’, made in December 1970,
that he found typical G. atkinsoniana without veil remains on exactly the same spot in
December 1971. We are inclined to regard collections with veil at the most as taxa in the
rank of variety. We do not consider it useful to give the described collections a formal name
as long as the constancy and reliability of veil characters in this group are not elucidated
and the nomenclature of the various recognized taxa is not cleared up by renewed type
studies. In any case G. annulata Barkman nom. prov. cannot be validated since it would be
a later homonym of G. annulata (Favre) Sing., which, completely accidentally, might refer
to the same fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collection consists of a single, dried sporocarp in bad condition. Barkman (1969)
placed this taxon in the group of Galerina with an entirely pubescent stipe. However we
found caulocystidia only at the upper third part of the stipe. The very pale, smooth and
almost papillate spores do not fit in with the spore characters of Galerina. Also the cream-
coloured pileus would be very unusual for this genus. These characteristics remind of the
genus Flammulaster Earle, in particular of the group around £F carpophilus (Fr.) Earle
( Vellinga, 1986). However, in this group the pileus is not smooth but rugulose and the pilei-
pellis contains chains of globose to ellipsoid cells. Neither Barkman, nor we could find
such elements in the studied collection. Furthermore the stipe of this fungus is pubescent
and dark at the base, instead of flocculose and pale in Flammulaster. On our request
E. Vellinga (Leiden) was so kind to study this collection as well and confirmed that it was
not a Flammulaster.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the pileipellis and shape and colour of the spores are more similar to
the genus Tubaria (W.G. Smith) Gillet. Tubaria pallidospora J. Lange was described as a
small species (pileus 5-10 mm) with pale colours and spores 9.5—10 x 5.5 µm. However
this fungus has subdecurrent lamellae and clavate cheilocystidia (Lange, 1939; Bon, 1992).
Consequently, the identity of 'Galerina anomala' remains obscure for the time being.#Misc-exposition*]

Barkman, the presence of encrusted pileocystidia. These structures are apparently lost in
the exsiccatum. Otherwise we wonder whether the presence of encrusted pigment would
be of sufficient taxonomic relevance to distinguish a variety, in particular since part of the

[@In the herbarium WBS are two collections, labelled Galerina atrofusca by Barkman.
The collection described above was designated as type on the label. It consists of only one,
very small sporocarp in rather bad condition. Galerina atrofusca was keyed out by Barkman
(1969) mainly on the basis of the striking grey-brown colours of the sporocarps and the
velvety pileus. However, the colour in the exsiccatum is, surprisingly, rather pale yellow-
brown and the pileus has a smooth appearance. Also in microscopical studies no trace of
scales or hairs on the pileus could be demonstrated. Barkman himself did describe the pilei-
pellis as made up of normal hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In our opinion this collection represents a variant of G. allospora Smith & Sing. with
abnormally dark pigments. It is interesting to note that Barkman described one of his collec-
tions of G. juniperina nom. prov. (= G. allospora) also as having a “dark grey-brown pileus”
(see G. juniperina). Most spores are completely smooth, but in very few spores a minute
exosporal blister near the apex could be observed. In addition, the size and shape of the
cheilocystidia fit in well with this species. In particular the somewhat pointed, triangular#Misc-exposition*]

Barkman himself wrote in his descriptive notes on this collection that the microscopical
characters are completely identical with G. pumila, and that only the colours of pileus and
stipe are deviating. We fully agree with this opinion, but are not inclined to attach much
taxonomic significance to the differences in colour. In our opinion they may be caused by
frost damage. The sporocarps were collected late in the year and the exsiccatum is in a bad
condition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The studied exsiccatum contains a single, strongly damaged sporocarp. It has all
characters of G. calyptrata. In particular the vividly orange tinge of the pileus is diagnostic
for this species. Barkman (1987) distinguished var. clavipila in view of the numerous clavate
cystidia on the pileus surface. We could not find these structures in the exsiccatum, although
the structure of the pileipellis was quite distinct in our preparations. In our opinion terminal
cells of the superficial hyphae may be considered by Barkman as pileocystidia, According

[@This taxon was keyed out by Barkman on the basis of a unique feature, viz. a thickening
of the wall halfway the cheilocystidia, which might indicate affinity with section Inocybe-
oides (Galerina nana (Petri) Kühner and allies). However, in the exsiccatum no trace of a
thickened wall could be found. According to Barkman it was present in part of the cystidia
only and in our opinion it is very likely that the observed thickening consisted of a refractive,
mucoid substance, occasionally seen in cystidia of several species of Galerina and in our
opinion not of taxonomic importance. The large, black humps on the cystidial walls, de-
picted in Coolia (Barkman, 1969: 83, fig. 37) can be safely regarded as a ‘poetic license’.
For the rest the sporocarp could be easily identified as G. pumila (Pers.: Fr.) Sing. on the
basis of its large, smooth, ellipsoid spores and slender cheilocystidia, often with triangular
apex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The collection comprises two young and two mature sporocarps in bad condition. The
spore ornamentation is characteristic of G. allospora (see also G, atrofusca) and in Bark-
man’s key G. glutinosa is placed in the same couplet as G. allospora. G. glutinosa is said
to be different by (1) viscid pileus and stipe, (2) lamellae forming a pseudo-collarium and
(3) shorter cheilocystidia with broader, obtuse capitulum. We could not find a trace of gelat-
inized hyphae in the pileipellis of the exsiccatum. Barkman described the pileipellis in his
notes also as a normal cutis. Moreover the combined occurrence of ‘a radially fibrillose-
tomentose' surface of the pileus and viscidity is difficult to imagine. We are inclined to
think that the viscidity of pileus (and stipe, not studied by us) has been an artefact, caused
by accidental weather conditions, for instance frost damage. The collection was made very
late in the season.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Also the occurrence of a ‘pseudocollarium’ is, in our opinion, accidental. This supposition

are typical of G. hypnorum as defined in this paper (see also our remarks on G. ramicola).
Barkman distinguished variety clavipila on the basis of the presence of clavate structures
on the pileus surface. We were unable to confirm this observation, possibly because of the
old age and bad condition of the material. However, we are inclined to consider these clavate
"pseudocystidia' as apical cells of normal hyphae of the pileipellis and to attach no taxonomic
significance to this phenomenon, the more so since similar structures were observed by
Barkman in G. calyptrata var. clavipila and G. sahleri var. clavipila (see there).#Misc-exposition*]

pileipellis and (3) slightly amygdaliform, smaller spores. It is remarkable that in the original
descriptive notes the pileus was indicated as 'orange-brown', whereas we found the hyphae
of the pileipellis to be practically smooth and the spores predominantly ellipsoid, exactly
as in G. pumila.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A closely related species, Galerina viscidula, was described by Orton (1988) from
Scotland. It is said to differ from G. pumila mainly in a viscid pileus, smaller spores (9—
11.5 x 5-6 µm) and shorter cheilocystidia (30-50 µm). According to Watling & Gregory
(1993) true G. pumila should have spores of (9—)12(—14) x 6-8 µm and cystidia measuring
60-100 µm. Spore and cystidial characters of the collection described above are in better
agreement with G. viscidula, but also the description of G. mycenopsis by Kühner (1935)
is in these respects more similar to G. viscidula than to G. pumila sensu Watling & Gregory.
This question deserves further study. For the time being we identify our collection as
G. pumila, a common fungus in the Netherlands.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This collection comprises seven sporocarps in reasonable condition. It differs from the
other collections, described in this paper under the name G. incurvata, among other things,
in sporocarps with conical, dull coloured pileus and in amygdaliform spores. Barkman noted
under his description that the colour of the pileus and spore shape were like G. mniophila
(Lasch) Kiihner, but that the colour of lamellae and spores were warmer, the pileus margin
inflexed and the cheilocystidia often acute. It was apparently named G. incurvata mainly
because of the inflexed pileus margin, which is, however, not at all unusual in G. mniophila
and allies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We could not observe important discrepancies between this collection and G. mniophila
sensu lato. That species was split by Kühner (1972) into three species. When these concepts
are accepted, the described collection shows most resemblance to C. pseudomniophila
Kühner in view of the practically smooth spores and shape of cystidia. However, we are
not convinced that these taxa are distinct species since the characters seem to be intergrading
(Arnolds, 1983). This question deserves further study.#Misc-exposition*]

collection of G. incurvata var. incurvata belongs (see our description above). However, it
differs in the often ovoid to amygdaliform, instead of ellipsoid spores; in the shape of the
cheilocystidia which lack the prolonged capitula characteristic of G. pumila and in the
encrusted hyphae of the pileipellis. It is more similar to G. permixta, also part of the species
complex described by Barkman under the name G. incurvata. The characters are almost
identical to those of the collections made by Jalink and Nauta (nrs. /46 and /47), described

[@The collection, described above, was indicated by Barkman on the label as type of
G. inversa. It contains two sporocarps in very poor condition. According to Barkman (1969)
this taxon is mainly characterized by the large apical exosporal blisters near the apex of
the spores, reminding of the blisters of G. calyptrata P.D. Orton and allies, but on the
opposite end of the spores. We found that such spores were present indeed, although very
rarely. Most spores were smooth or had small apical blisters, exactly as in typical G. allo-
spora (for comments on this name, see also G. juniperina). The shape of the cheilocystidia,
as described and depicted by Barkman, fits also well with that species, although the length,
measured by Barkman, is shorter than usual. We cannot explain the considerable difference
in spore size, measured by Barkman and us. We regard this collection as belonging to
G. allospora with sometimes abnormally well-developed exosporal blisters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These collections, labelled as G. juniperina, apparently belong to the same taxon in spite
of some variability in some characters. In Barkman's paper G. juniperina keys out in a
small group of species with long cheilocystidia with thin, often acute neck. The spores were
described as smooth or very weakly rugulose. G. uncialis is said to have the same type of
cystidia, but at the same time strongly rugose spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cheilocystidia in G. juniperina are remarkably slender indeed, but the neck is rarely
acute, more often slightly enlarged to subcapitate. The capitulum is often not globose, but
elliptical. Barkman himself noted at collection Barkman 9865: "cheilocystidia of the
allospora-juniperina type", and we agree that they are similar to those of G. allospora.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spores are completely smooth or slightly rugulose in two collections only. In the
remaining collections after careful examination always some spores could be found with
subtle apical thickening of the wall or small exosporal blisters in that region, again a
characteristic feature of G. allospora. Barkman himself noticed at collection Barkman 7984
that the spores were "smooth, without germ pore, sometimes at the apex with annuliform
wall-thickening". In six collections in addition very few spores were present with small
exosporal blisters in other areas of the spore, in particular near the plage.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In our opinion the collections with spores without exosporal ornamentation fit in perfectly
well with G. luteofulva P.D. Orton, the collections with spores with apical wall-thickening
or blisters with G. allospora Smith & Sing. We are convinced that these are two variants of
one and the same taxon, apparently with a weak tendency to form small blisters near the
apex and occasionally elsewhere on the spores. This opinion is confirmed by an observation
by C. Bas, who studied the type of G. luteofulva and observed spores with small apical
blisters, so characteristic of G. allospora (communicated by Barkman, 1970: 141).#Misc-exposition*]

[@One of the studied collections (Barkman 7806) is slightly deviating by the relatively
small, smooth spores (8-10 x 5—5.5 µm) and often subcylindrical cheilocystidia. We do

[@The collection, described above, was labelled as type and consists of four sporocarps in
rather good condition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Galerina lyophylloides was distinguished by Barkman (1969) mainly on the basis of
(1) "spores with cap-shaped thickened apex, (2) cheilocystidia with small slime cap at apex,
(3) pileus almost black, rugulose tomentose". In his own annotations, however, Barkman
described the spores as "smooth ..., sometimes with slightly loosening perispore (sometimes
as small cap on apex of spores)". Thus, spores with thickened apex were rather an exception
than a rule, in agreement with our observations. In fact the small apical blisters on some
spores are identical to those in G. allospora (see also remarks on G. junipera) and Barkman's
original drawing of a spore is quite similar. The drawing, produced in Coolia (Barkman,
1969: 72, fig. 38) with a black cap on the spore apex. is overdone.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Instead of a slime cap on the cheilocystidia (as figured by Barkman, 1969: 83, fig. 38).
we found only some small clots of greyish, refractive material, probably inside the apex of
the cystidia. We do not pay much taxonomic weight to this character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The very dark colours of pileus and lamellae, described for the fresh sporocarps, are
quite unusual within Galerina. However, the exsiccata are dark yellow-brown, not deviating
from typical collections of G. allospora (and many other species), which make us wonder
whether the dark colours may be caused by frost damage or another external factor. It is
striking that this collection shows much resemblance to the provisional type collection of
G. atrofusca (Barkman 7956), also described in this paper and collected a week earlier in
the same year 1964. We are convinced that they belong to the same taxon, close to or very
probably identical with G. allospora Smith & Sing. In this respect it is remarkable that in
his descriptive notes on a collection of G. juniperina (Barkman 8718), Barkman described
the pileus as ‘dark grey-brown’ and the stipe as ‘pale grey-brown’. This collection was, to-
gether with the other exsiccata of G. juniperina, identified by us as G. allospora (see notes
on G. juniperina in this paper).#Misc-exposition*]

replaced by *G. ramicola nov. spec. . The main difference with G. hypnorum was indicated
as the presence of a well-developed fibrillose annulus (Barkman, 1969). In addition he noted
that the spores were larger. In our opinion G. hypnorum usually has a thin, fibrillose veil,
leaving fugacious traces below the apex of the stipe (Arnolds, 1983). However, the de-
velopment of this veil is quite variable, from almost absent to rather copious, and we con-
sider the described fibrillose annulus as an example of a well-developed veil without
taxonomic relevance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The variability in spore size and shape is quite remarkable. The spores, described here
as ‘normal’, are characteristic of G. hypnorum with their irregularly loosening exospore.
The larger spores are often obviously misshaped and are considered to be abnormalities,
possibly caused by long preservation of sporocarps in a refrigerator.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should be noted that the identity of G. hypnorum is still disputed. We follow here the
species concept by Arnolds (1983), who described it as a small Galerina with yellow- to
orange-brown pileus and initially honey vellow stipe, characterized by spores of 7.5-11 x
4.7-6.2 µm with quite variable ornamentation, caused by the loosening exospore on various
places, in various grades and in variable proportions of the spores. The cheilocystidia are
rather short with a thick, subcapitate neck. Galerina hypnorum is the most widespread
species of Galerina in the Netherlands (Arnolds et al., 1995). In Barkman’s key (1969)
G. hypnorum in the above concept keys out under the names G. decipiens Smith & Sing.
var. decipiens and var. separans Smith & Sing. The description of G. hypnorum by Watling
& Gregory (1993) is rather similar, except for the spore size: (9-)10—12(-14) x 5-6(-7.5)
µm. According to Horak & Miller (1992) G. calvptrata P. D. Orton is a synonym of G. /yp-
norum. In our opinion the two species are different, although often confused. C. calvptrata
differs in a more acute, more vividly orange pileus and the slightly larger spores (9-13 x
5.5-7.5 µm) that are always smooth except for two smooth, exosporal blisters around the
plage. It is usually possible to distinguish the two species already in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This collection comprises three mature sporocarps in reasonable condition, but the tissues
were not well reinflating in KOH and therefore difficult to study. It was provisionally
described as a new variety of G. sahleri by Barkman (1969) on the basis of the presence of
clavate pileocystidia, which are said to be absent in other collections of that species. We
were unable to discover such structures in the exsiccatum, but this is not amazing in view
of the poor condition of the dried tissues. Barkman (1969) described also varieties with
clavate pileocystidia of two related species, viz. G. calyptrata and G. hypnorum, which let
us doubt the taxonomic significance of these structures. They may in fact be prolonged
extensions of superficial hyphae and might even be induced by long preservation of the
sporocarps in a refrigerator. The presence of moulds on the surface of the pileus suggests
that this was the case in this collection. See also remarks on G. calyptrata var. clavipila.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The identification of this fungus as Galerina sahleri is another matter of doubt. G. sahleri
is usually interpreted in the sense of Favre (1948). That fungus is close to G. calyptrata
P.D. Orton and shares calyptrate spores of approximately the same size. Differences between
the species are: (1) the presence of a cobwebby, fibrillose veil on the pileus in G. sahleri;
(2) the colour of the pileus is described as rather dark honey-brown in G. sahleri, and more
vividly orange in G. calyptrata; (3) absence of a farinaceous smell and taste in G. sahleri,
which are prominent in G. calyptrata and (4) longer, subcylindrical cheilocystidia (42-72
µm long) in G. sahleri. In the descriptive notes on the present collection no mention is
made of veil on the pileus; taste or smell were not recorded and the size of the cheilocystidia
is characteristic of G. calyptrata. Only the described colour of the pileus is in better
agreement with G. sahleri, but in our opinion it is more likely that this fungus represents a
somewhat dull coloured variant of G. calyptrata, which is a common fungus in the
Netherlands. It is doubtful whether G. sahleri is really indigenous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Desjardin (1995: 35), in his redescription of Mycena sotae Singer, stated that "the granu-
lose pileus ... dries dark brown?” the stipe arises "from a broad, sulcate, pulverulent, white
to grey basal disc;" the acanthocysts have "brown cytoplasmic contents;" and the basal
disc cystidia (similar to the caulocystidia) are "densely spinulose overall." These are the
same features which characterize M. fuscinea, but there are other characters which clearly
show the two species to be different. The pileus of M. sotae, under its granular cover, is
white; the acanthocysts are “angular or irregular in outline with 1—5 broadly rounded lobes;"
the cheilocystidia are very densely covered with excrescences.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present species would be identified in Desjardin’s key (1995: 9) as Mycena hemitri-
chialis Sing., but the description of the latter by Singer (1989: 74) shows some inconsisten-
cies that need comment. The pileus in M. hylophila is hemispherical to convex and tends
to flatten with age (conical to campanulate in hemitrichialis, according to Singer); the stipe
in hylophila arises from a small basal patch (in hemitrichialis there is “a well-developed
flattened ring of hispid mycelium surrounding and covering the swelling that constitutes a
rudimentary basal disc,” as demonstrated by Desjardin); in hylophila the caulocystidia are
densely covered with spinulae of the same size right to their tips (in hemitrichialis, accord-
ing to Singer, the spinulae on [the] distal 25% [part of the caulocystidia] are sparse and
longer [than the] spinulae on [the] proximal 7556 part).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Desjardin (1995: 14) defined his stirps Amparoina among other features by stating that
the cherocytes are thick-walled and possess spine-like projections and the caulocystidia
are densely spinulose overall. However, it is probably not possible to define any subgeneric
taxon without allowing one or more taxa to deviate in one or two of its characters. Sharp
lines of demarcation are rare in Nature, and this led Desjardin to accept Mycena sotae Singer
(p. 37) as a member of stirps Amparoina although the acanthocysts of the species are thin-
walled and lack spine-like projections, the connecting element being the acanthocysts “over-
all morphology ... suggestive of cherocytes.”#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena lasiopus constitutes a comparable case. Most of its characters agree with those
of stirps Amparoina but the cherocytes lack spine-like projections and the caulocystidia,

[@Desjardin’s key (1995: 9) to the species of section Sacchariferae would give no other
choice but to name the present species Mycena depilata Sing., but the original description
(Singer, 1989: 72) shows at least two clear differences from M. umbratilis. Singer found
the acanthocysts of the pileus surface (which he called dermatocystidia) much larger (20—
39 x 12-17-24 µm) than those of M. umbratilis, while his material apparently lacked cy-
lindrical caulocystidia. Desjardin who reexamined the holotype (consisting "of one frag-
mented stipe") did not find long-cylindrical caulocystidia either.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is most unfortunate that Singer's description gives so little detail (it is not known
whether the fresh pileus was sulcate; how many lamellae reached the stipe; which part of
the cheilocystidia was covered with excrescences and whether they were few in number or
densely spaced; whether there were clamps), but going by his measurements of the pileus
(1 mm across) and the stipe (up to 10 mm long) and considering that he found the spores
only weakly amyloid, it seems that all differences taken together are sufficient proof to
proclaim M. depilata and M. umbratilis two separate species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@AN ANNOTATED LIST OF THE PUBLISHED NAMES
IN ASTEROMELLA#Misc-exposition*]

[@S.G. VANEV! & H.A. VAN DER AA?#Misc-exposition*]

[@All species described in the coelomycetous genus Aszeromella are listed with synonyms,
literature data, and teleomorph connections, compiled from an extended literature,
Measurements of pycnidia, diameter of the ostiolum and conidia of all species are given
in a condensed form.#Abstract*]

[@Asteromella is a large genus of plant-inhabiting coelomycetous fungi characterized by nu-
merous globose or subglobose, thick-walled, dark brown, separate or more frequently
aggregated pycnidial conidiomata with more or less papillate ostioles that are sometimes
not well delineated or lacking. The conidia are very small, rod-shaped, bacterioid, one-
celled, and hyaline.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus was described by Passerini & Thümen in 1880, and more than 160 species
have been published up to now (Allescher, 1901; von Arx, 1981, 1983; Batista & Peres,
1961; Batista et al., 1960; Cash & Trotter, 1972; Corlett, 1991; Farr et al., 1989; Hawksworth
et al., 1995; Rupprecht, 1957, 1959; Saccardo, 1882-1931; Sivanesan, 1984; Sutton, 1980;
Tomilin, 1979).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Klebahn (1918) precisely described Asteromella-like pycnidial sporulation in the life
cycle of some Mycosphaerella species, without applying any specific epithets. Later Higgins
(1920, 1929, 1936) studied the connection between perfect and imperfect states of Myco-
sphaerella including Asteromella-like pycnidial forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the modern mycotaxonomic literature, all Asteromella species are regarded as micro-
pycnidial or spermogonial states of Mycosphaerella species (von Arx, 1949; Barr, 1972;
Corlett, 1991; Sivanesan, 1984; Tomilin, 1979).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of the species included now in Asteromella have been described earlier as Phyllo-
sticta or Phoma. Petrak (see Samuels, 1981). Rupprecht (1957. 1959) and many other authors
have created numerous new combinations, transferring many Phyllosticta and Phoma spe-
cies with very small, bacterioid conidia into Asteromella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite its importance, ubiquity and abundance, Asteromella has never been mono-
graphed. No extensive compilation or taxonomic revision concerned with Asteromella has
been published after the papers of Batista et al. (1960) and Batista & Peres (1961) dealing
with some Asteromella species, and the annotated index of the names of new taxa and com-
binations in Petrak's publications compiled by Samuels (1982).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present compilation is aimed to provide an alphabetical listing of the published spe-
cific and infraspecific names in Asteromella, to list the original place of publication for
each name, to determine the basionym of each species transferred into Asteromella, and to
provide data about the size of pycnidia, ostioles (o.) and conidia (c.) when available. Also
the hosts and countries, if listed in the original description, are indicated.#Misc-exposition*]

Macrolepiota#Misc-exposition*]

[@R.P.J. DE KOK! & E.C. VELLINGA?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Critical notes on the taxonomy and nomenclature of the Dutch Macrolepiota species with
ring with double crown are given. Macrolepiota bohemica (Wichansky) Krieglst. & Páz-
many is regarded as a synonym of M. rachodes (Vitt.) Sing. The new combination M.
rachodes f. olivieri (Barla) de Kok is made. Macrolepiota mastoidea (Fr.: Fr.) Sing. M.
gracilenta (Fr.) Mos. and M. rickenii (Velen.) Bellü & Lanzoni are synonymized. Macro-
lepiota permixta (Barla) Mos. is considered merely a variant of M. procera (Scop.: Fr.)
Sing.: notes on the nomenclature of M. nympharum (Kalchbr.) Wasser are presented.
Agaricus emplastrum Cooke & Mass. and A. repidarius Weinm. are regarded as nomina
dubia.#Abstract*]

[@The genus Macrolepiota Sing. is, within the family Agaricaceae, characterized by having
dextrinoid, strongly congophilous, metachromatic and large (7-20 x 5-10 µm) spores, with
a truncate apex and a large germ pore. The velum universale is an intricate trichoderm, and
a volva is absent. The number of species recognized in western Europe varies from 11
(Moser, 1983) to 18 (Bon, 1993). Six species occur in the Netherlands (de Kok, 1992).
Only M. rachodes and M. procera are common; M. excoriata is uncommon, and has declined
considerably since 1950 due to changes in agriculture; M. konradii and M. mastoidea are
both rare species in the country, and M. nympharum was found once in southern Limburg
in 1986 (see also Nauta & Vellinga, 1995 and Vellinga in Arnolds et al., 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macrolepiota rachodes and its synonyms, and the complex of M. mastoidea are discussed
in detail. Nomenclatural notes on M. procera and M. nympharum are provided.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fresh and herbarium material of all Dutch species have been studied. Colour codes are
according to Munsell (1975). Spores were measured in 556 KOH,4, or 1056 NH3(49). stained
with Congo red; spores were measured in side view. The notation [630, 59, 53] stands for
*630 spores from 59 basidiocarps of 53 collections measured'. The following abbrevi-
ations are used: Q = quotient of length and width, av. = average. All collections are in L.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This research was begun as part of an undergraduate project in 1990-1991 at the

[@The spelling of the name rachodes is somewhat controversial. The word rachodes lacks
a meaning, but the word rhacodes is derived from the Greek word ‘payog’ meaning rag
(Muller, 1926). This has led many authors (Fries, 1857; Locquin, 1942; Wasser, 1980) to
believe that Vittadini (1835) had made a spelling mistake. This however is unlikely, as he
is very consistent in the spelling of this taxon. We therefore agree with Singer (1951) in
using Vittadini's spelling for the name of this taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxon M. rachodes is macroscopically very variable; this has led some authors to
split the species up. Two names are important in this aspect, viz. hortensis and bohemica.
Pilát (1951: 422) described a new variety Lepiota rachodes var. hortensis; as no Latin
description was given this variety is not validly published. Pilát presented only a
macroscopical description and a reference to an illustration in Michael (1918: pl. 195). The
thin ring of the species illustrated makes it clear that this new species belongs to the
Excoriata-group of Macrolepiota (simple ring and smooth stipe), and not to the Rachodes-
group (ring with a double crown and smooth stipe). This same plate (Michael, 1918: pl.
195) was cited by Bon (in Bon et al., 1979: 13), when he described the new species M.
venenata, which is characterized by a thin annulus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Pilát & Usák (1952: pl. 1 1 1) another illustration of Lepiota rachodes var. hortensis is
given. The specimen depicted here, has a distinct ring with a double crown, implying that
this specimen belongs to the Rachodes-group. And this interpretation of var. hortensis has
been followed by subsequent authors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macrolepiota bohemica, described by Wichansky (1961: 102), is considered to be very
closely related to M. rachodes. All material of M. bohemica and M. rachodes available in
Leiden was examined, and the following observations were made. According to the origi-
nal description of M. bohemica the variation in spore length and width is 11-13 x 7.5-9.5
µm. In Fig. | the average spore length and width of all examined specimens are depicted.
Clearly M. rachodes is very variable in spore length and width, and the variation of M.
bohemica falls completely within its range. This is in accordance with the results of other
authors (Bon, 1981: 73-74; Candusso & Lanzoni, 1990: 534, 540).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The germ pore is mentioned by some authors (Bon, 1981: 73-74 and Candusso & Lanzoni
1990: 534—540) as a good character to distinguish M. bohemica (germ pore narrower than
| µm) from M. rachodes (germ pore wider than | µm). In the specimens examined no
discontinuity was found for this character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bon (1981: 73-74), Candusso & Lanzoni (1990: 532 & 538) and Bellü & Lanzoni (1987:
191-192) mentioned that the stipe and the bulb of M. bohemica are wider than those of#Misc-exposition*]

[@M. rachodes. In accordance with the results of Lavorato (1989: 274-276), no discontinuity
in the variation of this character was found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other characters used to distinguish the taxa are: shape of velum, colour of velum and
shape of the annulus (Moser, 1983: 245, and Bellü & Lanzoni, 1987: 191-192). Environ-
mental factors like moisture and temperature influence the expression of these characters,
and can therefore not be used to separate the taxa. As a result M. bohemica is considered a
synonym of M. rachodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@During fieldwork in the Netherlands it was observed that M. rachodes specimens found
in conifer woods were generally darker than the ones from other habitats (Fig. 2). If one
plots the average spore length of a specimen against the light/dark indicators (Munsell colour
code) of its pileus surface (i.e. not the veil) (Fig. 2). a separation based on these two
Characters is visible. The small-spored specimens (average spore length « 9.2 µm) have in
general a darker pileus than the larger spored specimens (average spore length 7 8.6 µm).
Furthermore all small-spored darker specimens have been found near conifers (Fig. 2) (in
the Netherlands near Picea). There is overlap between the two groups, but most specimens
can be easily assigned to one or to the other. No doubt this darker, smaller spored group of
M. rachodes represents a different forma. Fortunately, à name is already available. In
examining the type of Lepiota olivieri Barla, Bellü & Lanzoni (1987: 195) found that it
had a spore range of 7-8.5(-9.5) x 4.5-6 µm. The average spore length must be well below
8.6 µm. The specimen depicted by Barla (1889: pl. 9bis, figs. 6-10) is also darker then the
typical M. rachodes specimen depicted on the same plate. Furthermore the type of Lepiota
olivieri Barla is clearly depicted as standing in the litter of a conifer. This specimen must
be a representative of the small-spored dark form of M. rachodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ever since the description of M. gracilenta in 1836, taxonomists have struggled to find
characters to separate M. mastoidea from M. gracilenta. Among the characters used, are
spore length and width. Macrolepiota gracilenta is supposed to have slightly smaller spores
than M. mastoidea. In this research, based on 18 collections from seven countries, no gap
in the variation of the average spore width and length was found (de Kok, 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Pázmány (1985: 54-55), who studied ten collections from Rumania in
detail, in M. mastoidea the ratio of pileus diameter and stipe length (measured on exsiccates)
is 0.5-0.83 and in M. gracilenta 0.35-0.6. Furthermore, he found a correlation between
this character and the spore length and width. After combining Pázmány's data with the
present data (measured on exsiccates), no discontinuity or correlation between these two
characters was found (Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pázmány (1985: 54-55) stated that the ratio of stipe length and stipe diameter of
M. mastoidea is 10—23 and in M. gracilenta 25-30 (measured on exsiccata). In the combined
data set, most collections have relatively short stipes (ratio 10—15; measured on exsiccates),
the longest stiped specimens having been found in Rumania. However, there is a continuum,
and no correlation between this character and the average spore length could be found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Velum colour is considered to be an important character by several authors. An overview
of the literature is given in Table I. Macrolepiota mastoidea is considered darker, and more
distinctly ochraceous, whereas M. gracilenta is paler, and slightly pink-coloured. Two
collections, among the 18 studied, clearly show an intermediate colour range: Bas 7381
from Austria: reddish yellow to very light brown (7.5 YR 6/6 to 10 YR 8/3), and Boekhour
1026 from Belgium with pileus pink (7.5 YR 7/3) to beige brown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other characters like pileus and stipe diameter, pattern of velum on pileus and stipe,
and shape of the cheilocystidia are either too much influenced by environmental factors,
or else the differences are too small to justify a separation into separate species. Therefore,
M. gracilenta is considered a synonym of M. mastoidea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some authors (Bellü & Lanzoni, 1987; Bon, 1993) do not use the name M. gracilenta
anymore, as in the original diagnosis the lamellae are stated to be pale greenish (‘pallide
virescentibus’), reminding of a representative of the genus Chlorophyllum. The name M.
rickenii (Velen.) Bellü & Lanzoni is used instead, for the interpretation of M. gracilenta,
without greenish lamellae. Macrolepiota rickenii is considered to be as dark as or even
darker than M. mastoidea (Bellü & Lanzoni, 1987; Candusso & Lanzoni, 1990; Bon, 1993).
For an overview of the colours see also Table I. In view of the colour variation, and the
absence of correlating characters, M. rickenii is also synonymized with M. mastoidea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macrolepiota permixta Barla (1886) has always been considered to be very closely related
to M. procera. The main difference between the two species is that unlike that of M. procera,
the context of M. permixta turns red when cut (Barla, 1886). Most Macrolepiota species
turn reddish brown when they are cut. Such reddening of basidiocarps is considered to be a
sign of tyrosinase activity (Marr, 1984). In some cases, varietal status is given on account
of this discoloration (e.g. M. excoriata var. rubescens (Dufour) M. Bon, M. mastoidea var.
coccineobasalis (Locq.) M. Bon). The discoloration largely depends on the age of the fruit-
body and other conditions like moisture and temperature. Collections of Macrolepiota
species (including M. procera) can be found in which some specimens discolour red when
cut, while others, in the same collection, hardly discolour at all. Therefore, discolouring is
considered an unreliable character within this genus. Consequently, M. permixta is regarded
às a synonym of M. procera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus tepidarius Weinm. was described as a large mushroom, growing in a
greenhouse, hence the name. Judging from the description it is clear that this taxon belongs
to the genus Macrolepiota. However, a ring is not mentioned. Without particulars of the
ring or a microscopical examination of the type specimen it is impossible to identify this
species as either M. rachodes or M. venenata. The epithet was well known in the last century.
Fries (1836-1838: 13), Saccardo (1887: 29) and also Kickx (1867: 130) mentioned it as a
synonym of M. rachodes. However, until the type collection is found Agaricus tepidarius
remains a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lepiota emplastrum resembles M. rachodes, except for the spores. The spores of Lepiota
emplastrum measure 20 x 10-12 µm. and are angular. No material of the type or other Cooke
& Massee specimens of this taxon could be found at Kew. However, a drawing of this species
by Miss Wakefield exists. She worked with Massee in her early years, and she might have
known the species. In her drawing the spores are smaller than those of the original
description, but are still too large for M. rachodes. In Miss Wakefield's drawing a ring is
conspicuous in the mature specimen, and there is even a young specimen depicted with a
closed partial veil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hora (1960: 447—448) described a collection, which he identified as L. emplastrum, on
account of the striking resemblances with Cooke & Massee's fungus, as depicted in Cooke,
1890: pl. 1164 (1106), and because of the same habitat. Hora's collection, however, is
provided with a fugacious ring, but also with distinct evidence of a volva. Hora suggested
that Massee, who made the drawing of L. emplastrum, mistook the circumscissile volva
for a dropped movable ring, and lifted it in his painting. A volva is absent in Macrolepiota
species, but present in the closely related genus Volvolepiota, which is so far only known
from South America (Singer, 1986; Heinemann & de Meijer, 1996). The spores of Hora’s
specimen are 10-12 x 7-8 µm, and lack a germ pore. According to Hora a germ pore is
lacking in M. rachodes as well, which is contradictory to our findings. Hora also presumed
that the original Cooke & Massee collection had been contaminated with Entoloma-
spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Until the type collection or better material of L. emplastrum is found this epithet is best
regarded as à nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS A MONOGRAPH OF PHOMA
(COELOMYCETES) - VH
Section Sclerophomella: Taxa with thick-walled pseudoparenchymatous pycnidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@G.H. BOEREMA! & J. DE GRUYTER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper deals with ten species of Phoma, characterized by thick-walled pseudo-
parenchymatous pycnidia, They superficially resemble the thick-walled pycnidial
phenotype in species of Phoma sect. Plenodomus, but scleroplectenchyma is lacking
and teleomorphs belong to Didymella, not Leptosphaeria, Keys and indices of host-fungus
and fungus-host relations are provided and short comments on the ecology and distri-
bution of the taxa are given.#Abstract*]

[@The species of Phoma section Sclerophomella (Hóhn.) Boerema et al. (Boerema, 1997)
are characterized by thick-walled pseudoparenchymatous pycnidia (Fig. 1A, B) which
superficially resemble the thick-walled pycnidial phenotype in species of Phoma sect. Pleno-
domus (Contributions III-1/2; Boerema et al.. 1994, 1996). Just as in sect. Plenodomus
the pycnidium is initially closed, the opening occurs only late in the growing process, i.e.
the pycnidium has a pore instead of a predetermined ostiole. In some species there is also
retarded development of the pycnidial cavity, formation of a ‘pycnosclerotium’, containing
a compact mass of cells which afterwards disintegrates (histolysis) (Fig. 1C). However,
scleroplectenchyma (hyaline cells with thick walls and a relatively small lumen), charac-
teristic for sect. Plenodomus is always lacking. Members of sect. Sclerophomella are related
to the ascomycetous genus Didymella Sacc. ex Sacc. and not to Leptosphaeria as is the
case in sect. Plenodomus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In vitro, the hyaline conidia of species in sect. Sclerophomella are mainly aseptate, i.e.
Phoma-like. Secondary septation of the conidia may occur and is a typical phenomenon in
the type species of the section, Phoma complanata (Tode: Fr.) Desm. In host tissue, the
pycnidia of this species usually contain only aseptate conidia of ‘common Phoma-size’.
But sometimes a high percentage of the conidia becomes larger and 1-septate. They may
be distinctly Ascochyta-like, resembling the large conidial dimorph in Phoma sect. Hetero-
spora (Contribution IV, Boerema et al., 1997). Old pycnidia often contain many swollen,
dark, 1-septate conidia as in species of Phoma sect. Peyronellaea (Contribution II, Boerema,
1993). In vitro, the conidia of P. complanata are highly variable in shape and size, but usually
aseptate in fresh cultures: in old cultures distinctly large Ascochyta-like conidia may occur.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the description of the original genus Sclerophomella by von Hóhnel (1917: 237) the
conidiogenesis in the type species was misinterpreted. The ontogeny of the conidia in
P. complanata agrees completely with conidiogenesis in P. herbarum, the type species of
Phoma (electron-microscopic study by Boerema & Bollen, 1975). Another generic synonym
of the section, Sclerochaetella Hóhn. (Hóhnel, 1917: 251—252), is based on a sample of P.
complanata mixed with a Vermicularia species (Contribution III -2 under Diploplenodomus
rivini (Allesch.) Petr.; Boerema et al., 1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The section includes species with and without chlamydospores. If present the chlamydo-
spores are one-celled, solitary or produced in series or complexes. Two species of this section
have been treated in the Addendum of Contribution I-1 (de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates and herbarium specimens were studied as described in the previous Contri-
butions I-1 & 2 of this series (de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992 and de Gruyter et al., 1993).
The colour terminology used is according to Rayner (1970). Colony diameter on oatmeal
agar (OA), malt agar (MA) and cherry-decoction agar (CA) was measured after 7 days.
The outline of the colony is described as ‘regular’ or ‘irregular’, respectively. Q, representing
the length/width ratio of conidia, as well as the average dimensions (av.) of conidia refer
to 30 measurements with oil-immersion at 1250 x. If data have been obtained from more
isolates the ranges of averages are given. To check the absence of scleroplectenchyma (char-
acteristic for sect. Plenodomus) freezing microtome sections of the pycnidia were stained
with Lugol's iodine (JKJ). In scleroplectenchyma the thick cell walls become red by adsorp-
tion of the iodine, but in members of sect. Sclerophomella the walls of the cells in the peri-
dium of the pycnidia do not absorb the iodine; instead the contents of the cells usually
become red.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution. This is a cold-tolerant pathogen in northern Eurasia recorded
on wild and cultivated Cruciferae, including oilseed rape, Brassica napus var. oleifera. The
primary host seems to be horseradish, Armoracia rusticana. The fungus causes blackleg
symptoms resembling those on Brassica crops caused by Phoma lingam (Tode: Fr.) Desm.,
teleom. Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. & De Not. (treated in Contributions III-1.
Boerema et al., 1994). It has been suggested that in northern Europe isolates from Brassica
species termed 'Tox*? isol. L. maculans' are really P. nigrificans (Jedrycza et al., 1995).
Phoma nigrificans can be casily distinguished from P. lingam by its larger conidia and its
lower optimal temperature for growth in vitro (Boerema et al., 1986).#Habitat-distribution*]

[@In the present study a comparison of the holotypes of Coprinus calvptratus, C. vosoustii,
C. asterophorus and C. asterophoroides has been carried out, As a conclusion of the
latter we can state that all of them are conspecific, the correct name of this taxon being
C. calyptratus. On the other hand the study of the type of Coprinus xerophilus, a vernal
species which occurs in xerothermic plant communities on calcareous and gypsiferous
soils, shows that this taxon ts very close to C. calyptratus. Finally, we have studied the
type of C. arenarius, a species which shares the same habitat as both C. calyptratus and
C. xerophilus, and conclude that the former is different, being a species in its own right,
known only from Africa. Coprinus xerophilus is a new record for the European myco-
biota.#Abstract*]

[@The xerothermic plant communities which thrive on calcareous and gypsiferous soils in
the Iberian Peninsula are of great biological interest since they are composed of very selective
and endemic species. The extreme environmental conditions such as drought, saline soils
and high evaporation rates, characterize them as unfavourable habitats for a great majority
of organisms. Therefore, only a small number of specifically adapted plants (such as mosses)
and fungi (including some basidiomycetes and lichens) are able to colonize these eco-
logically harsh habitats. It is interesting to note that in the last few years several new fungi
have been described in these habitats. In this respect we may quote the description of four
new species in such different taxonomic groups as Simocybe iberica G. Moreno & Esteve-
Rav. (Moreno & Esteve-Raventós, 1991), Tulostoma pseudopulchellum G. Moreno, Altés
& Wright (Moreno et al., 1992), Phaeomarasmius gypsophilus Esteve-Rav., Villarreal,
Heykoop & Horak (Esteve-Raventós et al., 1998) and Marasmius celtibericus G. Moreno
& Raitviir (Moreno & Raitviir, 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this new contribution we describe a species of the genus Coprinus, C. xerophilus,
which we already knew for sixteen years but which, due to its vernal fructification united
to the great drought of the last years, could not be collected again until now. On the other
hand, after having carried out a thorough bibliographic study in order to confirm or rule
out the presence of this species in other areas, we became aware that several other species
of Coprinus such as C. calvptratus Peck, C. vosoustii Pilát, C. asterophorus Long & Miller,
C. asterophoroides Bogart and C. arenarius Pat, have been described from similar habitats.
Therefore, and after having observed numerous similarities in their original descriptions
we decided to compare their holotypes to elucidate the exact taxonomic status of all these
taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopical examinations have been carried out in NH,OH 5% and Congo red. The
microphotographs were made under a Nikon microscope, model Optiphot, with an
incorporated system of automatic photography. The film used is Kodak Plus X Pan 125
ASA. The SEM photographs were made with a Zeiss DSM-950 microscope using the fol-
lowing technique: gills and spores were rehydrated with concentrated ammonium hydroxide
(28-30%) for 30 min., dehydrated in aqueous ethanol (70%) for 1-1.5 hours, and, after
fixing for 2 hours in pure ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (= 1,2-dimethoxymethane), im-
mersed in pure acetone for at least 2 hours followed by critical point drying and sputtering
with gold-palladium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Results of the type studies#Misc-exposition*]

[@(1) The type material of Coprinus calyptratus (Figs. 1-5) consists of one well-preserved
basidioma with the following characters: pileus 4 cm diam., universal veil forming a thick
ochraceous star-shaped layer (with six arms). Stipe 10.5 x 0.5 cm, whitish, hollow, cylin-
drical with bulbous base (0.8 cm diam.). Microscopically the universal veil is formed by
ellipsoid to sometimes subglobose cells, very variable in size, densely packed and dissocia-
ting with difficulty when mounted under the microscope. Spores 18-20 x 10-12 µm. ellip-
soid, dark brown, with eccentric germ-pore on the abaxial side.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(2) The type material of Coprinus vosoustii (Figs. 6—10) consists of nine basidiomata,
some of them strongly fragmented, with the following characters: pileus 2-3 cm diam.,
universal veil ochraceous and well-developed, forming a thick layer which breaks up radially
into a star-shaped structure. Stipe 4.5—7 x 0.2-0.5 cm, hollow, cylindrical, with bulbous
and whitish base (0.5—0.9 mm diam.). Universal veil formed by cells very variable in shape
and size, dissociating with difficulty when mounted under the microscope. Spores 17-19 x
11-12 µm, ellipsoid, dark brown, with eccentric germ-pore on the abaxial side.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(3) The type material of Coprinus asterophorus (Figs. 1 1-19) consists of two basidiomata
in which the typical radially arranged structure of the veil on the pileus is well preserved,
whereas the gills are completely collapsed making it difficult to study them under the micro-
scope. The following characters were nevertheless observed: spores 17-19 x 11—12 µm,
ellipsoid, dark brown, with eccentric germ-pore on the abaxial side. Universal veil formed
by branched hyphae, very variable in shape and width, dissociating with difficulty when
mounted under the microscope. The material labelled as *Co-type' has been misidentified
by Long & Miller and corresponds to C. xerophilus (see comments on this species).#Misc-exposition*]

[@(4) The type material of Coprinus asterophoroides (Figs. 20-24) consists of five basidio-
mata, two of them strongly fragmented, with the typical star-shaped universal veil (with six
arms). The following characters were observed: stipe cylindrical, hollow, the base not pre-
served in any of the specimens. Spores 18-19 x 10-12 µm, ellipsoid, dark brown, with ex-
centric germ-pore on the abaxial side. Universal veil formed by densely packed cells, very
variable in shape and size, dissociating with difficulty when mounted under the microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After comparing their respective holotypes we must conclude that Coprinus calyptratus,
C. asterophorus, and C. asterophoroides, described from America, are conspecific with
the European species known as C. vosoustii. According to art. 11.4 of the International
Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Greuter et al., 1994) the correct name must be Coprinus
calyptratus Peck, introduced by this author (Peck, 1895) when he described this taxon for
the first time.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most striking features of this species are its habit similar to small forms of Coprinus
comatus, the persistence, even in dried herbarium material, of the star-shaped universal veil
and its spores with eccentric germ-pore located on the abaxial side. We must indicate that
Smith (1948) was the first author who considered both Coprinus calyptratus and C. astero-
phorus as synonyms, a statement on which we fully agree. Besides, Donelli & Simonini
(1989) when describing Coprinus vosoustii as new to Italy made a very clever observation:
"La specie de Pilát sembra molto vicina a due specie americane delle quali la specie europea
sembre essere — il trait d'union — Coprinus asterophorus Long & Miller e Coprinus
asterophoroides Van de Bogart". However, this hypothesis was never tested satisfactorily.#Misc-exposition*]

guished see observations on the latter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(2) The paratype of Coprinus xerophilus (Figs. 36, 37, 44—46) consists of one mature,
though somewhat fragmented, basidioma in which the following characters have been
observed: universal veil imbricate breaking up into thick scales, stipe 7 x 0.4 cm, cylindrical,
hollow, with whitish and bulbous base (1 cm diam.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@(3) The material labelled as *Co-type' of Coprinus asterophorus (Figs. 47-53) consists
of one small basidioma. It shows the typical imbricate universal veil breaking up into thick
scales. The latter is formed by septate, branched and clampless hyphae with extended cells,
constricted at the septa dissociating easily when mounted under the microscope. Spores
ellipsoid, dark brown, with eccentric germ-pore on the abaxial side.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(4) The type material of Coprinus arenarius (Figs. 54-58), a species which shares a
similar habitat, consists of three basidiomata, two of which are complete and one fragmented,
pressed and fixed on a thin cardboard. The gills of these specimens are very poorly preserved
but, nevertheless, we can assert that C. arenarius Pat. is different from C. xerophilus because
of its fairly narrower ellipsoid spores (15-17 x 8.5-10.5 µm) with apical germ-pore. Copri-
nus arenarius is very similar, macroscopically, to C. comatus (Mull.: Fr.) Pers.; it differs,
however, from the latter in having broader spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus xerophilus is characterized by its very thick and patently imbricate universal
veil, and by its large spores with eccentric germ-pore on the abaxial side. Because of the
radially arranged structure of the universal veil, consisting of hyphae formed by cylindrical
to globose cells, which remains on the pileus as a hood, this species belongs to section
Coprinus Pers.: S.F. Gray (2 Comati Fr. emend. Lange).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus xerophilus apparently is a vernal species, fruiting with the first rainfalls and
after several moderately warm days (15—20°C). We know it from the provinces of Madrid
and Guadalajara, but its distribution is probably much wider and it will certainly be found
in other similar gypsiferous and calcareous areas of the Iberian Peninsula. We have not
been able to observe neither the presence of cheilocystidia nor pleurocystidia, and so these
characteres should be confirmed in further collections. Nevertheless, the absence of cystidia
was also indicated in the original description of van de Bogart (1976).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus flocculosus D.C.: Fr. is similar to C. xerophilus in having spores with a germ-
pore located on the abaxial side, but the latter are smaller (11.5-16.5 x 6-9.5 µm); besides,
the universal veil is floccose and neither thick nor imbricate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus calyptratus fruits in similar habitats as Coprinus xerophilus. However, it differs
macroscopically from the latter because of its habit which recalls small fruit-bodies of
C. comatus, and by its typically star-shaped instead of imbricate universal veil. Furthermore,
the veil of C. xerophilus when mounted under the microscope is filamentous, formed by
branched hyphae and dissociates easily, whereas that of C. calyptratus is more densely
packed and dissociates with great difficulty. Finally, the features of the spores such as shape,
size and germ-pore are similar in both species. On the basis of their microscopic and eco-
logical similarities we can conclude that both species, though clearly different, are closely
related. We think this was precisely the reason why Long & Miller (1945) mixed them up
when they described Coprinus asterophorus as new to science from America, designating
a specimen with the typical star-shaped veil (which characterizes C. calyptratus) as the
holotype and a specimen with imbricate veil easily dissociating when mounted under the
microscope as 'co-type" (which corresponds to C. xerophilus).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the author's herbarium, there is an exsiccatum of a find of 1939 under the name of Flam-
mula gymnopodia (Bull.: Fr.) Fr. The fungus was identified by Mr. A.C.S. Schweers, a prom-

where, we decided not to publish this collection and to wait for new records. The fungus
was depicted in a water-colour painting by Mr. A. M. Middelhoek, an excellent illustrator
of micro-organisms and fungi (Fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species is based on Fries’ (1874) interpretation of Plate 601 of Bulliard (1791-1798).
In Persoon (1801) the species is included but without mention of the colour of the spores.
Fries (1874) described the spore colour as 'ferruginous' and placed the species in Flammula.
Disregarding this important character, Quélet ( 1888) classed Agaricus gymnopodia in Clito-
cybe, which was followed by Costantin & Dufour (1910), Bresadola (1927-1933), and even
by Kühner & Romagnesi (1953). The unpublished description of the species by Mr.
Schweers is translated and supplemented by the author, and the occurrence of this species
in the mycological literature is discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

an exception. The only genus of such fungi where strongly decurrent gills are observed is#Misc-exposition*]

[@Tubaria, but classification in this genus is not possible because of significant differences in
the clothing of the stem, the dimensions, the colour, and other characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A genus like Gvmnopilus can be excluded on account of the smooth spores in our species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pholiota gymnopodia shares a set of characters with Pholiota alnicola (Fr.: Fr.) Sing.:
such as the colour of the spores, the absence of pleurocystidia, the presence of cheilocystidia,
the dextrinoid spore wall, and the inconspicuous veil. But there are also many differences,
like the much taller basidiomata, the deeply decurrent lamellae, the naked stem, and the
shorter spores, reaching 8—10(—12) x 4.5—5.5 µm in P. alnicola. Pholiota alnicola is a very
variable species (see e.g. Tjallingii-Beukers, 1987). Even less or not bitter varieties secm
to exist, but it is not well possible to include our fungus in this complex of various forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Jacobsson (1986) studied in detail the taxonomic position of the *Pholiota alnicola' group.
He recognized three species: Pholiota alnicola (Fr.) Sing., P. pinicola Jacobsson, and P.
salicicola (Fr, ex Quél.) Arnolds. The fact that P. alnicola sensu lato grows on pine wood
as well as on wood of deciduous trees has been observed before by many mycologists.
Jacobsson (1986) distinguished separate species on account of colour shades and a somewhat
different smell, He stressed much the taste as a taxonomic character and therefore distin-
guished P. salicicola on account of its bitter taste. As our species also tasted bitter, as Mr.
Schweers mentioned explicitly, the comparison with P. salicicola may be more appropriate
than that with P. pinicola. Jacobsson's description of the latter species is somewhat fragmen-
tary but complete enough to establish several differences with P. gymnopodia. According
to Jacobsson, the smell of P. salicicola is strong and unpleasant, whereas our species was
odourless (Schweers). The spores of P. gymnopodia are somewhat shorter and we did not
Observe a germ pore. But, above all, the deeply decurrent lamellae are not present in
P. salicicola, or any other species of the Pholiota alnicola group, they seem to be also less
dense in Middelhoek’s painting. The shape of the cheilocystidia seems also to be somewhat
different (Fig. Ib). According to Jacobsson's restricted conception of the species (Jacobsson,
1986). P. evmnopodia must be considered to be a distinct species. This relates even more
to the comparison with P. pinicola. In a study of cultural characters in species of Pholiota
Jacobsson (1989) found P. alnicola and P. pinicola very similar, but the interspecific matings
between isolates of these species were unsuccessful.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Jacobsson (1990) reconsidered the position of P. salicicola and placed it with some doubt
into the synonymy of P. alnicola, mainly because of the absence of additional material and
different interpretations of the name in the older literature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In conclusion, there seems to be sufficient evidence to maintain Pholiota gymnopodia
as a separate species allied to Pholiota alnicola. It is to be regretted that data on the com-
patibility of the mycelia of these species are not available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The occurrence of P. gymnopodia in the mycological literature#Misc-exposition*]

[@After Fries’ (1874) redescription, the species is mentioned many times in the early British
literature, e.g. in Cooke (1884), where we find that Plate 431 remarkably resembles our
species with its decurrent, rather distant lamellae, its orange-brown pileus colour, its size
and stout, striate stipe. Furthermore, the species is present in Massee (1893), who wrote:
“a very distinct species” and in Rea (1922), but it is absent from Greville (1823-1828) and
Berkeley (1844-1856).#Misc-exposition*]

[@An important indication of the existence of the species is its presence in Saccardo (1887):
“species major, caespitose, distinctissima; stipites ultra longi, ...". Fries (1874) and Saccardo
(1887) mentioned that the species had been observed in "Vogesis’ by Mougeot (1887). In#Misc-exposition*]
[@Reijnders: Pholiota gymnopodia, comb. nov. 117#Page-header*]

[@the French literature of the 19th century (e.g. Léveillé, 1855; Gillet, 1874) the species is
absent as it is also from the Finnish work of Karsten (1876).#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand, it is more frequently encountered in the earlier German mycological
literature, starting with Britzelmayer (1891-1894), whose illustration was cited by Killer-
mann (1928). Moreover, the species was included in the compilations of Winter (1884)
and Migula (1912), but is absent in Ricken (1915), Michael et al. (1968-1975), and Moser
(1978), whilst in the Netherlands the species was previously unknown (Oudemans, 1905).
These citations are confined to the older literature, where the species has been repeatedly
mentioned. However, how many times it really has been observed is rather uncertain, though
Cooke's plate and Saccardo's record (Mougeot) give reliable evidence.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Statements about the habitat are vague: on the ground (Fries, 1874; Persoon, 1801; Saccar-
do, 1887; Winter, 1884; Migula, 1912). on pine sawdust (Cooke, 1881—1891), on both (Mas-
see, 1892-1895; Smith, 1908; Rea, 1922). Probably Cooke had observed the species growing
on pine sawdust and the other authors copied this statement. Unfortunately, the habitat of
our fungus is somewhat uncertain, but it probably grew on (pine?) wood.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the recent literature on Higher Basidiomycetes, the species is no longer mentioned.
The last note about it can be found in Part II of Dennis et al. (1960), as *gymnopodia, Flam-
mula: doubtful’. No mention of it appears in the large compilations of agarics of the begin-
ning or middle of this century (Bresadola, 1927-1933; Lange, 1935-1940; Konrad & Mau-
blanc, 1949; Kiihner & Romagnesi, 1953), nor does it occur in Singer (1986) or in the specific
American works on Pholiota (Smith & Hesler, 1968).#Misc-exposition*]

[@So we must conclude that this well-characterized species, representing a distinct taxon,
is strongly declining or has perhaps become completely extinct.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Especially after the study of some rich collections (R. Kristiansen RK 96.18 and RK
96.19) from the district of Hedmark in Norway, A. cervinus can be identified with certainty,
although investigation of several earlier Norwegian collections from the herbaria of Trond-
heim (TRH) and Bergen (BG) proved them to belong also to this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a thesis on Norwegian coprophilous discomycetes, Aas (1978: 21) described an 'Asco-
bolus sp. based on a collection from elk dung from the district of Hordaland (Troen 57b),
which proves to belong to this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Norway, this species has only been found on dung of elk, both in the southern and
northern parts of the country. It is remarkable that it has not been found in the south-eastern
coastal areas, despite elk being very common there and the frequent examination of elk
dung. Based on the Norwegian records, the species seems to have a vernal appearance,
April to July, depending on the latitude; which also proves that it tolerates a cold climate.
Despite intense search, it has not been found anywhere during summer or autumn.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently, Ascobolus cervinus has been reported from the Shaanxi province of China
(Zhuang, 1996). Buta study of the description and the material concerned (Q. -M. Ma etal.
2485, HMAS 33705), revealed that the mature ascospores are wholly hyaline and do not
possess the violet or purplish pigment layer, characteristic of the genus Ascobolus Pers.
The longitudinal ridges of the ascospore ornamentation easily stain with methyl blue. This
fungus, which is probably not coprophilous but growing on vegetable debris, proved to be
identical with Peziza urinophila Y.-Z. Wang & Sagara, described from Taiwan and Japan
from vegetable debris and forest litter after application of urea or after decomposition of
animal matter (Wang & Sagara, 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@By this more extensive study, it becomes easier to distinguish Ascobolus cervinus from
some related species, such as A, crenulatus P. Karst., A. michaudii Boud., A. castorensis
Aas, and A. fushanus Y. -Z. Wang & Brumm. A macroscopic distinctive feature of A. cervinus
is the absence of yellowish or yellowish green pigments, present in the receptacle and disc
of the other four species. On the contrary, A. cervinus becomes dark brown by the presence
of considerable amounts of an olive green to dark olive brown amorphous pigment; more-
over, the surface of the receptacle is the least warty or furfuraceous among these species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Apart from other characters, there are microscopically mostly clear differences in the
shape and size of the ascospores. As compared with A. cervinus, the ascospores in A. fus-
hanus (Wang & van Brummelen, 1997) have only a few longitudinal striae and are of about
the same length, but more narrowly ellipsoid in shape (14-18 x 6.5-8 µm; Q = 2.01- 2.36).
In A. michaudii the ascospores are considerably larger (17-22 x 9.5-12 µm), while in
A. crenulatus, the ascospores are clearly smaller and more broadly ellipsoid (11.1—12.9 x
6.1-7.6 µm; Q » 1.53-1.72). Ascobolus castorensis, which seems to be restricted to dung
of beaver (Castor fiber), has ascospores of about the same size as A. cervinus, but is well-
characterized by the presence of many prominent yellow-orange warts on the upper part of
the receptacle (Aas, 1977).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caccobius minusculus was described from a specimen in Dr. R.F. Cain's herbarium,
collected in 1956 in Ontario, Canada (Kimbrough & Korf, 1967). The new genus Caccobius
Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf was created ‘for species intermediate between Ascozonus and
Thelebolus' .#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species is presumably psychrophilic or strongly tolerant of cold growing conditions,
since it was found after a long period of cold weather and snow. The Norwegian locality is
situated on a group of islands at the south-eastern outlet of the Oslofjord, close to the Swedish
border. The locality is an accessible point on acidic rock. The sparse vegetation consists
mostly of small pines (Pinus sylvestris) and carpets of heather (Calluna vulgaris) with some
shallow marshes. The place is frequented by deer and elk, judging from the amounts of
dung of these animals. Other coprophilous species recorded simultaneously on these sub-
strates are Ascozonus woolhopensis (Berk. & Br. in Renny) Boud., Thelebolus polysporus
(P. Karst.) Otani & Kanzawa, Thelebolus stercoreus Tode: Fr., Trichobolus sphaerosporus
Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, Ascobolus brassicae Crouan, and Ascobolus sacchariferus
Brumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pinkish red colour of the fresh fruit-bodies, already observed in the field, is a constant
character, which may gradually fade in dried material. The Canadian material was described
as ‘pallid to white’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ‘mucilaginous sheath around each ascus’, as described by Kimbrough (Kimbrough
& Korf, 1967), is certainly due to the presence of a very thick periascus (van Brummelen,
1998). The paraphyses are long and often overarch the ascus top, but in both collections of
Caccobius minusculus studied, no evidence was found for the presence of an epithecium
or 'pseudoexcipulum above the true excipulum’ as described by Kimbrough (1.c.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caccobius was considered to be related to non-operculate genera of the Thelebolaceae
(Korf, 1972; Kimbrough, 1972) or even to the ‘inoperculates’, because of the presence of a
‘plug’ in the top of the ascus, staining with Waterman's blue-black ink (Samuelson, 1978;
Samuelson & Kimbrough, 1978).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A more detailed study of the ascus structure in the genera of the Thelebolaceae (van
Brummelen, 1998) revealed a wide variation in structure and even more in the function of
the opening mechanism of the ascus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Large amounts of inner wall material form a central thickening at the top of the ascus.
Usually the thickening is central, but it may also be located more towards the side of the
apex. In Caccobius, as well as in Ramgea, Pseudascozonus, and some species of Thelebolus,
opening of the ascus occurs after splitting within the inner wall layer in the apex more or
less parallel to the ascus surface. This is considered the typical Thelebolus-type of ascus
structure (van Brummelen, 1998). The central thickening in Caccobius may reach a thickness
of 3 µm and a width of 4—6 µm and is sharply delimited by sharp folds in the inner wall
layer in the subapical region. At first, this thickening shows little or no differentiation. Later
it becomes clearly stratified by strata of alternating low and strong reactivity after the Thiéry-
test. On still further ripening, the stratification becomes less evident, but can still be seen
as fine horizontal lines. When treated with Waterman’s blue-black ink, the irregular boundary
planes of the cavities and the fine lines within the central thickening especially stain blue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a recent phylogenetic analysis of 21 selected species of Ascomycotina with DNA se-
quencing techniques (Landvik et al., 1998), three species of Thelebolaceae (Thelebolus
stercoreus Tode: Fr., Ascozonus woolhopensis (Berk. & Br. in Renny) Boud., and Caccobius
minusculus) were included. The results show, that these Thelebolaceae group together and#Misc-exposition*]
[@Van Brummelen & Kristiansen: Two rare coprophilous ascomycetes from Norway 125#Page-header*]

[@indicate a closer phylogenetic relationship with representatives of the inoperculate disco-
mycetes, like Leotia lubrica Pers. and Microglossum viride (Pers.) Gillet, than with members
of the operculate Pezizales. This confirms earlier sequencing studies by Momol &
Kimbrough (1994), who found that an unidentified species of Thelebolus was not related
to seven members of operculate Pezizales. With their methods, Landvik et al. (1998) were
not able to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within this group of three Thelebolaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@STUDIES OF LACTARIUS FROM MEXICO:
A NEW SPECIES IN SUBGENUS PIPERITES#Misc-exposition*]

[@L. MONTOYA!, V.M. BANDALA! & G. MORENO?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius lacteolutescens is described as a new member in subgenus Piperites subsect.
Croceini. It was found growing in a mixed forest of Pinus spp. and Abies hickellii, at
Mt. Cofre de Perote, Central Region of the State of Veracruz (Gulf Area, Mexico).#Abstract*]

[@The mycobiota ectotrophically associated with the Pinaceae of Mexico is of particular inter-
est, since a great number of species of Pinus, at present known in the world, occur in this
country, including several taxa restricted to its territory and neighbouring areas (Rzedowski,
1978; Perry, 1991). At present several species of Lactarius associated with these conifers
in Mexico have been reported (Guevara et al., 1987; Montoya et al., 1990, 1996; Montoya
& Bandala, 1996), including a new species (Kong-Luz & Estrada Torres, 1994). In the Cofre
de Perote Region, in the central area of the State of Veracruz, an interesting species of Lac-
tarius has been found growing in association with Pinus (P. patula, P. pseudostrobus, and
P. montezumae). Because of its distinctive characters (yellow staining latex, size and shape
of cystidia, and basidiospore ornamentation) it is considered a new species in the subgenus
Piperites (Fr.) Kauffman subsect. Croceini (Burl.) Sing. sensu Hesler & Smith (1979).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods. This study is based on the analysis of fresh and dried specimens. Annotations
of colours in brackets were codified according to Kornerup & Wanscher (1978) colour man-
ual. Microscopic analysis was carried out on sections mounted in 5% KOH. The basidio-
spores were observed in Melzer's reagent and were measured in side view. The dimensions
of the basidiospores do not include the ornamentation; their height is indicated separately.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ranges of spore measurements correspond to the absolute values measured (25
basidiospores per collection) and the range of the means is mentioned in brackets. L (mean
length) and W (mean width) correspond to the mean of means + standard deviation (sd).
The range of the means of quotient Q (= length/ width) and the mean of means + sd are also

[@Distinguishing features of this species are the size of the basidiomata, the colour change
of latex on exposure, and the darkening of the stipe and lamellae surfaces with age. Micro-
scopically the size and shape of cystidia which are abundant and conspicuous and the
basidiospore ornamentation are diagnostic. The presence of rosettes in the hymenophoral
trama is also noticeable. The distinctive and immediate yellow staining of the latex, com-
bined with the pileipellis structure support the position of Lactarius lacteolutescens in the
subgenus Piperites subsect. Croceini sensu Hesler & Smith (1979). In this group, the species
keys out close with L. colorascens Peck and L. vinaceorufescens A.H. Sm.#Diagnosis*]

[@According to descriptions by Hesler & Smith (1960, 1979) and the re-examination of
the type material, in Lactarius vinaceorufescens and L. colorascens the basidiomata have
a pileus diameter more or less equal to the stipe length (or larger), while in L. lacteolutescens
the stipe is twice as long as the pileus diameter. Lactarius vinaceorufescens has a pileus of
40-120 mm diam. and a stipe of 40—70 x 10—25 mm, and L. colorascens a pileus of 25—
50 mm diam. and stipe 25-35 x 3-5 mm. Moreover, L. vinaceorufescens was reported
with paler basidiomata and (apparently) without papillate pileus. On the other hand, micro-
scopic analysis showed that L. colorascens (Figs. 10-12 and 18-19) has smaller basidio-
spores 6—7.2(—8) x 4.8-5.6 µm (L = 7.04 + 0.10; W = 5.30 + 0.08; Q = 1.34 + 0.02), witha
less reticulate ornamentation, having more isolated ridges and verrucae, which at times are
combined with discontinuous low bands. It has infrequent and shorter cystidia (44-66 x
6.4-8 µm) and scattered isolated sphaerocytes in the lamellae trama. Lactarius
vinaceorufescens (Figs. 13-15 and 16-17) presents slightly smaller and more globose
basidiospores (6.4—)7.2-8 x 5.6-6.4 µm (L = 7.42 + 0.11; W = 6.08 + 0.08; Q = 1.22 +
0.02) bearing isolated ridges and verrucae; cystidia 36—60 x 8.8—12(—13.6) µm, clavate or
rarely mucronate and scattered; hymenophoral trama lacking rosettes. Table | shows a
comparison of spore dimensions of the three taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@SQUAMANITA CITRICOLOR, A NEW SPECIES
FROM CENTRAL AFRICA#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. BAS! & D. THOEN*#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new Squamanita citricolor is described from Zaire (Democratic Republic of Congo).
It has à medium-sized basidiocarp characterized by a glabrous yellow pileus, a whitish
to yellowish stipe rising from an ochraceous yellow, obconical, deeply rooting basal bulb,
and very thick-walled fusiform pleuro- and cheilocystidia. Because it has to be assumed
now that all Squamanita species are mycoparasites and that the basal body formerly called
protocarpic tuber is in fact a deformed basidiocarp of another species infected by
Squamanita mycelium it is proposed that the term "protocarpic tuber' is replaced by the
new term 'cecidiocarp'.#Abstract*]

[@In 1971 the second author collected in Zaire a remarkable agaric with a smooth yellow
pileus, whitish lamellae, and a whitish to yellowish stipe with remnants of a cortina and
rising from a prominent radicating ochraceous-yellow bulb. This collection turned out to
represent an undescribed species of Squamanita, actually the first species of this genus re-
corded from Africa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On account of its large fusiform cystidia this new species, named here S. citricolor, seems
to be closely related to the widespread S. umbonata, known now from North America,
Europe and Asia. However, it differs from the latter in its smooth pileus and the very thick
wall of the cystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In a very interesting paper Redhead et al. (1994) described the case of basidiocarps of a
species of Squamanita, named S. contortipes. found to be growing on deformed but still
recognizable basidiocarps of Galerina spp. Although several authors had earlier suggested
that members of Squamanita are parasites on other agarics (for a survey see Redhead et al.,
1994: 1815) this was the first solid proof of the parasitic nature of species of Squamanita
and persuative evidence that all Squamanitas are mycoparasites.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When it is accepted that the more or less tuber-like basal bodies in Squamanita are
deformed basidiocarps of other agarics, two major problems concerning the morphology
of Squamanita are resolved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first of these problems was the fact that in the group of species with orange to yellow
or yellow-brown pilei these tuber-like bodies have the acrophysalidic tissue typical for
Amanita and Limacella species, whereas in the species with blue-grey pilei acrophysalides
are completely lacking. This looked like such a fundamental difference that generic separa-
tion of the two groups would be unavoidable. However, when we assume that the acro-
physalidic nature of some tubers is a character of the host parasitized by a species of Squa-
manita, it has no bearing on the taxonomy of the genus Squamanita.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second problem was the curious fact that some species of Squamanita seem to have
two universal veils, viz. one forming a volval limb on the basal tuber and another forming
scales at the base of the stipe proper and on the pileus (see Bas, 1965: 353—354).#Misc-exposition*]

[@136 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 1, 1998#Page-header*]

[@This is most apparent in S. squarrulosa, described by Ridley (1988) from New Zealand,
and would be a unique construction in the agarics. But if the outer volval limb (very evident
in some species, hardly visible or absent in others) is interpreted as a remnant of the outer
layer of the parasitized basidiocarp of the host and caused by the primordium of the
Squamanita breaking out of the tissues of the host, then this problem also no longer exists.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bas (1965: 356) introduced the term protocarpic tuber for the fleshy, short-lived, basal,
more or less tuber-like body of Squamanitas from which one or more basidiocarps may
arise, and the term was adopted by Singer (1975: 22; 1986: 17). Redhead et al. (1994: 1816)
rejected this designation, when it became clear that these protocarpic tubers do not belong
to the Squamanita basidiocarps but are galls provoked by infection of basidiocarps of other
species of agarics with Squamanita mycelium. We concur but propose a new term for these
galls for two reasons. Firstly, these galls have a very special nature as it is likely that they
always produce chlamydospores. In S. odorata, they often fail to produce Squamanita basi-
diocarps, but always produce large amounts of chlamydospores, and therefore represent a
biologically very important part of the life cycle of S. odorata. Secondly, it is useful to
have a term available that can be used unaltered in all languages. Therefore we propose re-
placing the term ‘protocarpic tuber’ with ‘cecidiocarp’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In view of the heavy fibrillose-squamose volval decoration of the pileus and the base of
the stipe in the related species S. umbonata and S. schreieri, the total absence of volval
remnants from the mature basidiocarp of S. citricolor is rather surprising. It looks as if the
distribution of the vela in this species is a sixth to be added to the five types illustrated by
Bas (1965: 353). The hyphae of the pileipellis being agglutinate, it is, however, possible
that under very wet conditions the cap is viscid and that in the type-collection the volval
remnants have been washed away. But in that case one would expect to find at least a few
volval fragments at the base of the stipe and/or on the top of the cecidiocarp. The true
nature of the volva in this species will be revealed only when some very young basidiocarps
are collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@F. ESTEVE-RAVENTÓS & M. DE LA CRUZ#Misc-exposition*]

[@Entoloma exiguum sp. nov. is described. It belongs to subgenus Claudopus and is char-
acterized by the tiny size, very reduced stipe, white colours of the fruit-bodies, tapering
pileus hairs and spores with 6-8 angles. A discussion about some other close taxa is
given, as well as drawings of micromorphological characters.#Abstract*]

[@During the summer of 1997, a species of Entoloma (Fr.) P. Kumm. with tiny fruit-bodies,
belonging to the subgenus Claudopus Gillet, was discovered growing gregarious among
detritus under herbaceous plants at the edge of a reservoir. The locality is situated on marl
and limestone, and was formerly used as a vegetable garden remaining abandoned since
the construction of a dam. The river banks where the fruit-bodies were found become flooded
only in rainy years. They remain inundated only for a short period during the summer, before
water is taken from the reservoir to irrigate downstream fields. As a consequence of this, a
particular amphibious vegetation develops similar to that of calcareous vernal ponds, with
Gnaphalium luteo-album, Pulicaria paludosa, Potentilla supina, Juncus gerardii, Plantago
major subsp. intermedia, Crypsis schoenoides, etc. (de la Cruz et al., 1995). Deposition of
floating organic matter, mainly mud and plant debris, takes place over this vegetation, gener-
ating a belt of nitrophilous vegetation around the banks of the reservoir. Polygonum lapathi-
folium, Polygonum persicaria, Eragrostis minor and other herbaccous species, under which
the fruit-bodies were collected, usually cover this belt.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to Hawksworth et al. (1995), the number of Claudopus taxa known is about
20, mostly from the northern hemisphere. In Europe, according to Noordeloos (1992, 1995),
in section Claudopus seven species have been recognized, but some others will probably
be discovered in future. In this section, the small size of the basidiomata and some possible
confusions with other ‘crepidotoid’ agarics are probably the cause of this actual reduced
number. The taxa belonging to section Claudopus show little macroscopic variation and
their colours range predominantly from whitish to greyish (exceptionally bluish!); never-
theless, microscopic characters, especially related to sporal shape and type of covering lay-
ers, are quite different and permit a clear distinction among many taxa. In this section some
species show a characteristic farinaceous or mephitic (garlic-like) smell, such as Entoloma
mephiticus (Murrill) Hesler or a still undescribed new species recently found in Spain (Horak
etal., in prep.), but many of them are odourless. Other species show a peculiar parasitic or
saprophytic relationship with other fungi, e.g. Entoloma parasiticum (Quél.) Kreisel or
E. pseudoparasiticum Noordel.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species with white colours, of which habit and ecology might resemble E. exiguum, are
E. albotomentosum Noordel. & Hauskn. and E. jahnii Wölfel & Winterh. Both have been
found growing on plant and grass debris, in paludicolous and silvicolous habitats. Entoloma
albotomentosum is very similar to E. exiguum, but it is clampless, has larger basidia, and
the spores are less angular (4—6 angled) with a different shape (Noordeloos & Hausknecht,
1989). Entoloma jahnii is characterized by the presence of clavate to subcapitate hairs in
the pileipellis and stipitipellis and, like E. exiguum, has clamps in the hymenium, though
its spores seem to be different too (Wólfel & Winterhoff, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Though it shows an encrusting greyish pigment in the fruit-bodies, E. ollare Ludwig &
Ródig somewhat resembles our new species in the pileipellis structure, but was found in a
very peculiar habitat, a flower-pot, and its farinaceous smell and a well developed stipe
would place it occupying an intermediate position between sections Claudopus and Undati

[@Mycena verna is a member of section Fragilipedes and seems, at least in the key to the
species (Maas Geesteranus, 1988a: 45), to be close to Mycena subexcisa (P. Karst.) Sace.
The arguments for this supposed proximity are (1) diverticulate hyphae of the pileipellis
which are not embedded in gelatinous matter; (2) presence of pleurocystidia; (3) and a rather
large number of lamellae. Mycena verna differs, however, from M. subexcisa (Maas
Geesteranus, 1981a: 228) among other things in the occurrence among broad-leaved trees,
cespitose habit, fully glabrous stipe. hardly prominent cheilocystidia, manifestly broader
spores, those of M. subexcisa being Q = about 1.8.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the European members of section Fragilipedes, there are two further vernal
species which exhibit a cespitose or subfasciculate habit and grow on debris of deciduous
trees. These are M. abramsii (Murrill) Murrill (Maas Geesteranus, 1988a: 50) and M. laevi-
gatoides Maas G. (1988b: 132). The former species may already be recognized in the field
by its raphanoid smell when collected, as well as by the copious, watery juice when its
stipe is broken. Microscopically, M. abramsii may be told by most of the cheilocystidia
having sharp-pointed necks. The second species can be distinguished from M. verna by
the ivory white pileus, its pruinose stipe and the cheilocystidia forming a sterile band.#Misc-exposition*]

[@If a combination of features such as smooth cheilocystidia, presence of pleurocystidia,
diverticulate hyphae of the pileipellis and smooth hyphae of the stipe cortex may be
considered an indication of close affinity, Mycena verna, M. fragillima A.H. Smith (Maas
Geesteranus, 1988a: 79) and M. leptocephala (Pers.: Fr.) Gillet (Maas Geesteranus, 1988b:
134) would have to be regarded as related species. However, both M. fragillima and M.
leptocephala deviate from M. verna in having striking caulocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This fungus is a typical representative of the genus Dermoloma, characterized, among
other things, by a hymeniderm with parietal, brownish pigment and small, hyaline spores.
It differs from all species described so far in the consistently sterile edge of the lamellae,
lined by cheilocystidia. Furthermore, the grey staining of bruised lamellae has not been
reported for any other species. In view of the amyloid spores, D. cystidiatum belongs in
section Atrobrunnea (Singer, 1975). It is rather similar to D. scotodes (B. & Br.) Pegler,
described from Sri Lanka, but that species further differs in having an almost white pileus
margin, slightly larger and more elongated spores (5.2—6.5 x 3.2-3.7 µm) and a white
(instead of grey-brown) flocculose stipe (Pegler, 1986). Spore size and pileus colour are
more similar to D. atrobrunneum (Dennis) Sing. from Central America, but that species
differs also in having a grey-brown stipe with dark brown fibrils (Pegler, 1983). Dermoloma
cystidiatum is also related to the European species D. josserandii Dennis & P. D. Orton. in
particular to var. phaeopodium (P. D. Orton) Arnolds with a dark brown pileus. Differences
are, next to the presence of cheilocystidia and the staining of the lamellae on bruising, the
presence of grey-brown (instead of white) dots on the stipe and slightly smaller spores in
D. cystidiatum ( Arnolds, 1993). A grey-brown dotted stipe has been described so far only
from D. cuneifolium (Fr.: Fr.) M. Bon var. punctipes Arnolds, a taxon with inamyloid spores
(Arnolds, 1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dermoloma cystidiatum has been collected repeatedly in great quantities on the type
locality. The habit and size of sporocarps showed a remarkable variability, even within this
single population. A similar variation was reported by Arnolds (1992) for D. cuneifolium
in western Europe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The mycoflora of the northeastern part of North America is introduced in this overview of
representatives of all groups of fungi, except microfungi. The area which is covered reaches
from North Carolina in the south east to Kansas in the south west and Manitoba in the
north west; the Atlantic Ocean is the eastern border. This book is the first attempt to make a
unified survey of this area, many parts of which still await study. The book is very much an
overview, as only 1500 species are described and keyed out, and of these 600 are described
more fully and illustrated with colour photographs. Unfortunately, a ‘rationale’ for the
choices made, either in the selection of the 1500, or the 600 species to treat more fully, is
not given.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fungi have been divided into 22 major groups, represented by colour illustrations of
representatives from each group, while the species descriptions constitute the main part of
the book, with genera arranged in alphabetical order within groups. Briefer descriptions of
the non-depicted species are included within the keys. The keys themselves are not dicho-
tomous and as many as nine alternatives are given on occasion. The user may have to work
through every alternative before concluding that a fungus is not keyed out at all. In some
keys one of the first steps requires knowledge that is not visible on the fruit-body itself.
Several species-rich genera, e.g. Cortinarius, Inocybe, and Russula, lack keys entirely and
are represented by only a few of the more common and distinctive species. Photographs
are arranged according to the major groups and follow the treatment of the group. While
small (8 or 7 per page), the quality is in most cases good. Examples of the less felicitous
ones are Squamanita umbonata and Strobilurus conigenoides.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A minor point of criticism concerns the naming of authors. It looks as if a computer
program has changed every ‘ex’ into a colon, regardless of its meaning, so strange citations
are the result (e.g. Laccaria nobilis Mueller: Smith instead of ‘Smith in Mueller’; Puc-
ciniastrum potentillae Komarov: Jaczewski, Komarov, and Tranzsche; Xylaria polymorpha
(Persoon: Mérat) Greville where the correct form is “(Persoon: Fries) Greville’). The same
kind of computer abuse is probably the cause of mis-spellings of authors’ names, c.g.
*Bonorden’ instead of ‘Bon’, and ‘Venturi’ where *Ventenat’ is the author.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Very short introductions to mycophagy, microscopy and chemical reagents, a glossary,
lists of mycological literature and guide books, and indices, both to common and Latin
names, complete the work. The language is informal and the use of technical terms has
been reduced to a minimum. But despite this, the book will be difficult to use. This is caused
first of all by the structure of the keys, which form the most important part of the book. The
lay-out of the keys, which is very quiet and pleasant on first view, becomes very monotonous
without visual points of reference, and further hampers easy usage. In short, this book is
neither a field guide, nor a flora, and it demonstrates that good keys are difficult to make.#Misc-exposition*]

to provide keys to its species, with descriptions and crayon drawings for all of them. Their
work is presented in the series ‘Atlas des cortinaires’, of which 9 volumes have appeared
so far. The present volume is the first to be published ‘outside’ the main series and gives an
overview of section Hinnulei in subgenus Telamonia, a notoriously difficult group of brown
mushrooms. The book starts with a one-page philosophical introduction and an additional
half-page of quotation, There mycology is defined as “un contenant contradictoire en devenir
transfini" and it is asserted that the “contradictoire et le contradictoire seul” is what allows
mycology to make sense. Perhaps this is why as many as 40 new species, four new varieties,
and three new formae are presented. Keys are given to the infrasectional en-tities, many of
which are also described as new (even stirpes are given Latin descriptions), and to the species.
The user of the keys will be hampered by lack of explanation of used terms, and by the fact
that in keys to stirpes characters are said to be present in the more typical members of the
group. The presentation is an historical overview, followed by commentaries in which spe-
cies descriptions are embedded and illustrated with black and white line drawings. Unfor-
tunately the quality of these drawings is very poor in comparison to the excellent colour
crayon drawings at the end of the book. As an illustration of French cortinariology, par-
ticularly as expressed in the works of Henry, this is an important work, though whether in
practice it can be used to determine hinnuloid Cortinarius species is seriously to be doubted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The publication of this extremely thorough monograph on the morphology and anatomy of
the Hymenomycetes is undoubtedly a milestone in mycology. In the introduction the author
writes that modern molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics have led to an enormous

neglect or even suppress research on the morphological diversity of organisms and that
this book is written for those who still believe that the knowledge and the study of the total
organism is essential for biology. With some understatement the author calls this book of
nearly 1000 pages a modest attempt to upgrade the appreciation of organismal biology.#Misc-exposition*]

[@More than 450 species of Eucalyptus are currently recognized. Many of these trees were
initially planted in botanical gardens and arboreta, and distributed through these to other
parts of the world. Plantings of fast-growing eucalypts dominate the landscape in many
parts of the world. Mycosphaerella leaf blotch disease is a serious epidemic, pathogenic
threat to these plantations. Disease symptoms vary from early leaf abscission to general
leaf spotting and even stem cankers. The dothideaceous genus Mycosphaerella, with more
than 1800 species published, is one of the largest ascomycete genera known. Many species
are pathogenic to leaves and stems of different host plants. In this book 57 species of Myco-
sphaerella and their anamorphs, associated with eucalypts, are treated with full descriptions
and illustrations of microscopic details of ascospores, asci, conidia, and conidiogenous cells.
Six new species of Mycosphaerella are presented and also several anamorph species are
described as new. Keys to both teleomorphs and anamorphs are presented. The hypothesis
that Mycosphaerella is heterogeneous, is tested, using multiple correspondence analysis
(MCA) of 18 Mycosphaerella species with known anamorphs, testing 27 sets of multistate
characters. Clustering of taxa obtained with MCA showed several distinct clusters, sup-
porting the supposed heterogeneity of Mycosphaerella. The clusters found correspond to
the various anamorph states, suggesting that this is indicative of various groups (genera?)
within Mycosphaerella. Various proposals for the separation of genera, subgenera, and sec-
tions within Mycosphaerella are discussed. A new coelomycetous genus, Xenostigmina, is
proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The book, which only treats smaller fungi (strangely — but maybe wisely — enough, no
definition is given of the term Microfungi), is organized according to hostplant, in a number
of categories: the plurivorous wood and bark fungi, plurivorous leaf-litter fungi, fungi spe-
cific to trees, shrubs and woody climbers, p:urivorous fungi on herbaceous plants, fungi
specific to various herbaceous plants, plurivorous fungi on grasses, fungi specific to grasses,
fungi on rushes, sedges, bur-reeds and reed-maces, fungi on ferns, horsetails and club-mosses,
and fungi parasitic on rusts and powdery mildews. In the plurivorous categories a key is
given to the genera of fungi, then the species in alphabetical order according to the genus,
and in cases with several species per genus a key to the species. In the other categories
everything is organized according to the hostplant, in alphabetical order. Not only some
knowledge of plant names is required, the user is also supposed to be able to distinguish
between different classes of fungi: within the categories plurivorous fungi, first a division
is made into Discomycetes, other Ascomycetes, Hyphomycetes, Coelomycetes, and, if
appropriate Uredinales and Ustilaginales. This system is continued within the other cate-
gories per hostplant. Within these classes the fungi are treated alphabetically according to
genus. With the category fungi specific to trees etc., first the fungi on leaves are given, then
those on fruits or seeds and finally the ones on wood and bark.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The keys and descriptions in the book are rather simple and short, and mostly lead without
much difficulties to a name. Although this is the power of the book, it is in many cases
insufficient for reliable identifications and additional, specialised literature should be con-

sometimes out of date, have not been changed in the new edition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although more than 3500 species of microfungi are treated, the book is far from complete.
Not surprising, since so little is in fact yet known about microfungi. The appearance of the
first edition has popularized the study of small fungi enormously, but was therefore quickly
sold out. It is gratifying that the book has become available again, although the extra value

[@The second volume in this series is dedicated to the genus Lactarius. The introductory chap-
ters give an extensive account of the macroscopical and microscopical characters of the
genus, the infrageneric classification, ecology and food value of the genus. The keys to the
species are followed by detailed species descriptions supplemented by at least one coloured
photo and line drawings of spores, cystidia and pileipellis. These generally are of good to
excellent quality. Data on geographical distribution and a long list of references complete
the book. It is a very attractive book, the first of its kind for the genus in many years, that
certainly will find its way to professional and amateur mycologists. Unfortunately, the
authors introduce a new, rather confusing terminology for pileipellis types. Regretfully they
did not discuss these new terms in a broader mycological circle before introducing them,
thus causing confusion. The keys lay too much stress on ecology, particularly the host tree,
which will cause difficulties for the user. The most serious problem within this book is
probably formed by the rather unequal species concepts used by the three authors, varying
from rather narrow (L. trivialis versus L. utilis; L. vietus versus L. syringinus) to far too
broad (L. fulvissimus, L. rubrocinctus). Also similar nomenclatoral problems lead to different
solutions as is shown by introducing new species names for L. cremor and retaining the
doubtful name L. rubrocinctus at the same time. It is also rather risky to synonymize
Northamerican taxa with European ones without knowing the real variation and geographical
distribution of the taxa involved (L. duplicatus versus L. lapponicus).#Misc-exposition*]

of a certain number of Heterobasidiomycetes, Boletales, Agaricales, and Russulales have
been added. In 324 plates of very high quality on glossy paper four to six figures are presented
with ultrastructural details. Scanning electron micrographs generally show small basi-
diomata, basidia, basidiospores, cystidia, hyphae, and crystals. Transmission electron micro-
graphs show details of thin sections of basidiospores, spore walls, parentosomes, apicull,
and spore ornamentation. For the description of basidiospore wall layers and structures
Clémengon’s terminology is followed. To understand the structure of mature basidiospore
walls it was often necessary to study the ontogeny of the different wall layers. In general,
for each family a description and discussion are given of ultrastructural details of the spore
wall, the basidiospores, the basidium, and other structures, like apophyses, dolipores,
hyphae, and cystidia. This atlas is indispensable for those interested in the structure or

[@This thesis is a world-wide taxonomic revision of the ascomycete family Triblidiaceae of
the order Rhytismatales. This family was proposed by Rehm (1888) with two genera, and
strongly extended to eleven genera by von Hóhnel (1918, 1924). More recently the Tribli-
diaceae were anew defined by Hawksworth & Sherwood (1982) with 7riblidium and Pseudo-
graphis, and extended by Eriksson (1992) with Huangshania. These three genera are also
included in the present study. The family is characterized by the hemiangiocarpic fruit-
bodies, the presence of both paraphyses and paraphysoids, and its ascus structure. A more
profound account of these characters in this and related families of the Rhytismatales is
missing. Efforts to obtain cultures of Triblidium species were not successful, since the asco-
spores failed to germinate. The author recognizes and describes four species of Triblidium,
and two species each in Pseudographis and Huangshania. About half the book is devoted
to genera and species excluded from the Triblidiaceae. Most of these taxa are also presented
with full descriptions and drawings of microscopic details. A key is included to represen-
tatives of the Triblidiaceae and species that could be kept for these with a hemiangiocarpic
or pseudohemiangiocarpic development and growing on bark. It is an important contribution
to an up to now poorly known family of ascomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

Acanthophysellum, Acanthophysium, Aleurobotrys, Aleurocystidiellum, and Gloeosoma).
The taxonomic arrangement, important character states, and ecology are briefly discussed.
Illustrations elucidate the most important terms, though a glossary is not provided. A synoptic
key and a dichotomous key to the species are given. It is unfortunate that geographic char-
acters are used as important steps in the dichotomous key, as little is known about the distri-
bution areas of the species, and quite a few species have been recorded from widely separated
parts of the earth. A second problem with the keys is the choice between dendrohyphidia
and acanthophyses, elements which both may have widely branched apices. All 71 species
referred to Aleurodiscus are described, and illustrated with black-and-white drawings. The
book does not claim to be a monograph because, in most cases, the descriptions have been
based on the type collection only, though sometimes on fresh specimens collected by the
authors. Six out of the 71 species are described as new. The book is completed with a list of
species names which have been referred to the genus. Despite shortcomings and typo-
graphical errors this book is a useful guide to an interesting group of fungi and can form

seedlings of coniferous trees, have been investigated. Standard descriptions of the rhizo-
morphs are given, considering the structure, development, and eventual interaction with
pollen. Each description and chapter ends with a discussion, while there are also à special
chapter with discussions and a recapitulation of discussions. In a special root chamber system
the mycelial growth has been followed in vivo. Of each species under study all steps of
mycelial ontogeny are depicted in detailed drawings. Three types of rhizomorphal systems
can be distinguished, differing in structure and extension. The four species of Suillis studied
showed exactly the same structure and development of their rhizomorphs. Characters playing
an important role in the ecology of ectomycorrhizae are the extension of the rhizomorphal
system, the ability to form ring-shaped structures and hyphal fans, the frequencies of back-
ward oriented branches and substrate adhesion hyphae, and the tendency to form vessel-
like hyphae with frequently dissolved septa. This is a valuable enlargement of our knowledge
about the ontogeny of ectomycorrhizae. The editors should have considered the great number

of this pilot project are given, together with the goals, management and time frame of the
research. The other chapters deal with sampling protocols, as there are procedures for col-
lecting all different classes of fungi and how to handle them, protocols for isolation and
culturing fungi, sampling protocols for fungi associated with living plants or other fungi,
woody substrate, aquatic substrates, and animals. The last chapter contains useful references.
The project was planned to last seven years, of which the first two would be in the form of
a pilot project. A large sum of money would be involved for this ambitious and unique
project. Sadly enough the project has stopped now due to economical and political circum-
stances. What remains is this book with protocols for an inventory of all kinds of fungi,
surely a useful contribution to the planning of any kind of such an all taxa inventory any-
where in the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This volume of the well-known flora contains two rather unrelated groups of mushrooms:
the Cantharellaceae and Gomphaceae with four genera, and part of the Tricholomataceae
with 17 genera (amyloid-spored) and 14 genera, respectively (xeruloid taxa). It is stressed
in the introduction that several of the genera are still poorly known and in need of further
revision. This applies particularly for the genera Melanoleuca and Hemimycena. Also the
status of the xeruloid genera as a natural group is a matter of discussion. The flora follows
closely the concept of the preceding volumes. The keys are not always very clear, and do
not in all respects correspond with the descriptions of the species. Not all species are
represented with figures. These figures are of varying quality.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We are relatively well informed about the macromycetes of Japan, but about those of the
vast territories of China we still know relatively little. In the present monograph 47 species
of Amanita from southwestern China are treated, nine of which are new and 15 others had
not been recorded from China before. The descriptions are very detailed and the line draw-
ings exquisite and highly informative. The author accepts section Caesarea as distinct from
section Vaginatae and proposes to transfer the A. citrina-group from section Phalloideae
to section Validae. There are keys to the infrageneric taxa and to the species of each section.
An impressively long list of references is added. Let us hope that more of such excellent
monographs will follow.#Misc-exposition*]
