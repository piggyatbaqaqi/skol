[@TYPE STUDIES IN COPRINUS SUBSECTION LANATULI#Misc-exposition*]

[@C.B. ULJÉ! & M.E. NOORDELOOS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a prelude to a monograph of the genus Coprinus, types were studied of a number of
species said to belong to Coprinus subsection Lanatuli ( Coprinus alnivorus, C. alutacei-
velatus. C. philae, C. arachnoideus. C, asterophorvides. C. brunneistragulatus,
C. bubalinus, C. citrinovelatus, C. colosseus, C. jonesii, C. lagopides, C. marcidus,
C. pachydermus, C. palmeranus, C. roseistipitatus, C. scobicola, C. spadiceisporus,
C. sylvicola, C. tectisporus, C. undulatus and C. xerophilus). As a result Coprinus alni-
vorus and C. lagopides are transferred to subsection Alachuani.#Abstract*]

[@Whilst preparing à series of monographic studies and a treatment of the genus Coprinus
for the Flora agaricina neerlandica type collections were studied of a number of species
described in subsect. Lanatuli, including those from other continents. The results have been
published in the form of a revision of the subsection for the Netherlands (Uljé & Noordeloos,
1999; Uljé et al., 2000).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since type material is often scanty and / or in bad condition, not all the desired characters
were available. Type material of old names has usually not been preserved or is now lost.
This is the case in C. cinereus J. Schaeff., C. pseudoradiatus Kühner & Joss. ex. Watling,
C. lagopus Fr.: Fr., C. funariarum Métrod, C. lagopus var. sphaerosporus Kühner & Joss.
and C. erythrocephalus (Lév.) Fr. Unfortunately a number of type collections were not
received, even in the case of some recently described species. Some taxa have been ex-
cluded from this paper because they have been described and illustrated in full elsewhere.
These are Coprinus bicornis Uljé & Horvers, C. calosporus Bas & Uljé, C. spelaiophilus
Bas & Uljé, C. ochraceolanatus Bas. C. geesterani Uljé and C. krieglsteineri Bender
(Bender, 1987; Uljé, 1992; Uljé & Bas, 1993). For species treated in the present paper,
original descriptions have been included for à better understanding of the taxa concerned.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitat. Lignicolous, on hard scarcely rotted wood of A/nus sp. in a hardwood rain forest.#Habitat-distribution*]

[@This species is similar in many features to C. arachnoideus and likewise appears to be transitional to
section Lanatuli in its veil characteristics and possession of pleurocystidia. It differs from C. arachnoideus
in most of its microscopical features.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes. The holotype collection of Coprinus alnivorus consists of fragments of a single
basidiocarp in good condition. The large cystidia noted by Van De Bogart were not found
in the material examined,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although Van De Bogart (1976) suggested Coprinus alnivorus might have an affinity to
subsection Lanatuli, it definitely belongs to subsect. Alachuani on account of the branched
and diverticulate veil. It has not been recorded from Europe (Uljé & Noordeloos, 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@La description qui précede n'est pas trés complete, mais résulte pourtant de l'observation de plusieurs
récoltes effectuées en des lieux et à des moments distincts. Son caractere incomplet est dà à la déli-
quescence des carpophores, probléme général avec les coprins, mais surtout à la croissance du champignon
dans la dune blanche. La présence inévitable de grains de sable sur les fructifications, en particulier au
niveau de la cuticule (souvent déjà trés génante chez les champignons chamus que l'on peut pourtant ar-
river à "nettoyer sans leur causer trop de dommages) s'est révélée ici extremement préoccupante.
L'observation, si importante, de la structure vélaire a été tres difficile et n'a pu étre réalisée correctement
que sur le type et sur l'exemplaire breton. Néanmoins, l'aspect macroscopique du voile rattache évi-
demment cette espece aux Lanatuli et nous étions persuadé depuis longtemps d'avoir à faire à un nouveau
taxon. Nous avons attendu de la retrouver plusieurs fois afin de compléter sa description dans la mesure
du possible et de nous assurer de son caractere original. Nous nous décidons donc à la publier, méme si

[@This species is closely related to C. asterophorus Long & Miller and to C. xerophilus Van De Bogart.
It shares many morphological features as well as the arid habitat with both. C. asterophoroides differs
from C. asterophorus in possessing a distinct and persistent hyphal strand in the stipe lumen, the universal
veil remaining white even when dried, the germ pore often very eccentric, the much larger diameter of
the universal veil elements, the absence of a bulbous volvate stipe base, and the larger and much broader
basidia with pigmented apices. C. asterophoroides differs from C. xerophilus in the universal veil
remaining stellate, the smaller germ pore, the absence of a bulbous volvate stipe base, and the pigmented
apex of the basidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A review is given of the tropical African representatives of the genus Lactarius subgenus
Plinthogali (Burl.) Hesler & Smith. In this subgenus the new section Nigrescentes Ver-
beken (incl. L. orientalis stat. nov.) is defined for species with a blackening context. For
the species with a rather smooth, sometimes shiny cap and latex changing to greyish-
brownish when drying, the section Pseudofuliginosi Verbeken sect. nov. is proposed (incl.
Lactarius atroolivinus Verbeken & Walleyn spec. nov.). All other representatives are
provisionally classified in the section Plinthogali (incl. Lactarius sulcatus Verbeken &
Walleyn spec. nov., L. tenellus Verbeken & Walleyn nom. nov.) before a more world-
wide revision permits a further split of this diverse group. A checklist of the species is
given, supplemented with illustrated descriptions of some species.#Abstract*]

[@The taxonomic position of Arcangeliella dolichocaulis Pegl., showing affinities with
Lactarius subgenus Plinthogali, is discussed.#Abstract*]

[@In an account of North American Lactarius species Burlingham (1908) defines the group
Plinthogalae as medium-sized milkcaps with a dry, pruinose to velvety, dark brown, smoky
brown or putty-coloured to paler pileus, a rather firm context, pruinose gills which become
darker with age, mild or acrid, and salmon-coloured or white latex which is either unchang-
ing or changing to salmon-pink, at least where in contact with the broken flesh, or in some
species becoming yellow. Seven species are included in this group, which is accepted as a
section by Singer (1942).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hesler & Smith (1979) emend the section Plinthogali (Burl.) Sing. to subgenus level as
follows: cap a typical velvety to unpolished and dry pileus, with blackish, fuscous, date-
brown, alutaceous, dingy buff or dull white colours; latex white, cream or rarely brown,
usually changing to reddish, vinaceous, lilac or violet or staining injured surfaces with these
colours; true cystidia mostly absent; pileipellis a trichoderm (a palisade ss. auct.), less fre-
quently a cellular layer with a turf above it; spore-ornamentation often prominent. They
distinguish two sections: section Plinthogali, including species with a blackish, dark to
medium brown pileus, a brown intracellular pigment in the pileipellis and mostly a well
developed pilear trichoderm, and the section Fumosi Hesler & Smith for species with a
paler pileus and a reduced or not evident trichodermal structure of the pileipellis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bon (1980) splits the section Plinthogali into a subsection Ruginosi M. Bon for species
with winged spores [ornamentation up to 2—3(—4) µm high] and a subsection Fuliginosi
(Konr.) Bon (invalid), for species with more or less completely reticulate spores [ornamen-
tation up to 1—1.5(-2) µm high].#Misc-exposition*]

[@In tropical Africa, the subgenus Plinthogali seems well represented and more diverse
than in North America or Europe. Some members are well characterized by a remarkable
colour-change of the latex and a strong staining of the context. Their latex appears at first#Misc-exposition*]
[@378 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 3, 2000#Page-header*]

[@watery and transparent, then turns to blood-red, grey and finally black. The context is cream
and becomes first greyish pink or greyish red, finally black. In dried condition, those species
are easily recognized by the black colour of the context. Owing to this striking character
which is not known outside Africa, these species are placed here in a new section, Nigres-
centes. As to the other species, both the classifications of Hesler & Smith (1979) and Bon
(1980) are considered highly artificial and not applicable on a worldwide scale. Hesler &
Smith (1979) themselves admit that their proposed sections were very difficult to separate
within the format of a key. This is not surprising as they put such obviously closely related
species as Lactarius ruginosus Romagn. and L. subplinthogalus Coker in different sections.
We do not consider the absolute height of the spore-ornamentation as a taxonomically
valuable character for distinguishing subsections, especially not when taking into account
that it is partly related to the size of the spores, which is very variable in this group, and
that it would necessitate separating such closely related taxa as Lactarius pterosporus
Romagn. and L. acris (Bolt.: Fr.) S.F. Gray. A further detailed revision of this subgenus on
à worldwide basis (esp. including more tropical members) should result in a global and
natural classification of this group; we therefore prefer to limit the proposal of new sections
and subsections, but indicate some groups that might form natural stirps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic features are studied in congo-red in ammonia. Spore-ornamentation is
described and illustrated as observed in Melzer's reagent. For details on terminology we
refer to Verbeken (1995, 1998). Line-drawings are made with the aid of a drawing tube at
magnifications 6700 x for spores, 3200 x for individual elements and 1100 x for sections
and surface views. Stippling indicates refractive contents in cystidia and lactifers, intra-
cellular pigmentation in the elements of pilei- and stipitipellis. Basidia length excludes sterig-
mata length.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores are measured in side view in Melzer's reagent, excluding the ornamentation, and
measurements are given as (MINa) [AVa—2*SD]—AVa —AVb—[AVb + 2*SD] (MAXb) in
which AVa = lowest mean value for the measured collections, AVb = greatest mean value,
and SD = standard deviation. Q stands for ‘quotient length/ width’ and is given as (MINQa)
Qa- Qb (MAXQb) in which Qa and Qb, stand respectively for the lowest and highest mean
quotient for the measured specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colour-codes are from Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). L+l/cm means number of lamellae
(L) and lamellulae (1) per cm at pileus mid-radius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The representatives of this section are described and illustrated by Verbeken (1996). The
microscopic description of L. griseogalus R. Heim, which was made from typematerial in
bad condition, was extended later with some illustrations made from the specimen Nicholson
179 (K) (Fig. 1), which is in much better condition but unfortunately lacks fieldnotes. This
specimen has spores measuring 7.5-8.8-10.0(10.4) x 6.7-7.3-7.8 µm (Q = 1.07-1.21-
1.35; n = 20), thus somewhat broader than those of the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since our first observations on these species, many more collections of L. baliophaeus
var. orientalis have come to our attention, all of them easily separable from the ‘type variety"
by the differently shaped spores. In fact, no intermediate cases have been observed. It is
difficult to discriminate between these two taxa unambigously in the field, but L. baliophaeus
var. orientalis seems to lack the ochraceous/beige cap colours and the crenulate margin
characteristic for L. baliophaeus var. baliophaeus (Plate 1). These observations have
convinced us that this variety deserves species rank:#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@1. This section consists of a fairly large number of temperate and tropical species, showing
great variability. Further research is needed to look for valuable characters (e. g. spore-deposit
colour) which may reveal the relationships between these species. Within the African repre-
sentatives some groups of species can be recognised (e.g. L. kabansus- L. tenellus and
L. melanodermus—L. nudus-L. congolensis—L. sulcatus), but some other species seem to
be very isolated (L. sulcatulus).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. It should be noted that several of Heim's species are only known from the type, most
often old collections in very bad condition and microscopically insufficiently documented.
Their place in the proposed key should be regarded as provisional since more collections
are needed to fully clarify their identity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@New field observations have convinced us to upgrade this relative of L. kabansus Pegler
& Piearce to species level. As well as the clear microscopical distinction with L. kabansus
(terminal elements of the pileipellis obovoid to broadly clavate, 10-20 x 8-15 «µm in L.
kabansus; terminal elements of the pileipellis cylidrical, long and slender, 10-40 x 6-10
µm in L. renellus, Fig. 7), additional macroscopical differences were established during
recent fieldwork. Lactarius tenellus has a rather dark brown cap when very young which,
together with its contrasting white lamellae, makes it reminiscent of L. lignyotus. The cap
colour typically fades to grey, almost without brownish components, while L. kabansus
has brown to dark brown colours, eventually also becoming very pale when specimens are
exposed to the sun (Plate 7). Lactarius kabansus is usually a more robust species, with an
irregular, deflexed margin, while L. tenellus is a slender species with a crenulate margin.
The initially pure white lamellae of L. tenellus become more yellowish, but not as soon
and as ochraceous orange as in L. kabansus. In case of doubt, cutting the stipe base seems
to be an unambiguous test: the context in the base of the stipe is white and stays white in L.
tenellus, while in all encountered specimens of L. kabansus, even in old and insect-infected
ones, the stipe base is orange when cut. As to the spores, no conspicuous differences have
been observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@OBSERVATIONS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three taxa have a rather distinct position within the subgenus because of their pileipellis-
structure: they lack globose or swollen elements and the elements are embedded in à distinct
slime-layer. A trichoderm-like structure is unusual within the subgenus, but other characters
such as spore-ornamentation, the dark intracellular pigmentation in the pileipellis, and
macroscopic habit strongly argue for a position in the subgenus Plinthogali. Macroscopically
the taxa are recognized by the dull brownish, often olivaceous or ochraceous colours and a
smooth, even shiny, pileus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of its olivaceous colours and macrocystidia with needle-like content, L. atro-
olivinus could be a link to certain species in the subgenus Piperites (Fr.) C.H. Kauffm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6. Observations on Arcangeliella dolichocaulis Pegl.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Arcangeliella dolichocaulis is described by Pegler (1982) from Zambian miombo wood-
land as an epigeal, agaricoid mushroom with a smooth, glabrous and dry pileipellis, a well-
developed stipe and an exposed, sinuate, globulose, somewhat radiating to alveolate laby-
rinthoid hymenophore, forming numerous, small irregular locules without any geotropical
orientation. It contains copious latex, which is white, unchanging and tastes like cedarwood
with a bitter after-taste. We examined the type (Rose 7701, K) and observed the following
microscopic characters (Fig. 11):#Description*]

[@Spores 7.8—8.5—9.7 x 6.7-7.7-9.0 µm, subglobose (Q = 1.05-/./0-1.21); ornamentation
amyloid, consisting of an almost complete reticulum with ridges up to 1.5 µm high; plage
distally amyloid; basidia 4-spored, clavate to subfusiform, 35—45 x 9—12 µm; true cystidia
and pseudocystidia lacking; hymenophoral trama consisting of thin-walled hyaline hyphae
which are more or less parallel and embedded in some slimy consistence; lactifers scarcely
present: pileipellis and stipitipellis a palisade with a well developed layer of isodiametric
cells and a suprapellis of thin-walled, |—3-septate cylindrical elements.#Description*]

[@Pegler (1982) has already stated that the basidiomes of Arcangeliella dolichocaulis are
completely agaricoid apart from the glebulose hymenophore and are closer to Lactarius
than to Arcangeliella as defined by Pegler & Young (1979). Indeed, if this species had a
normal hymenophore and pseudocystidia, it would fit perfectly in Lactarius subgenus Plin-
thogalus because of the winged spore-ornamentation with distally amyloid plage and the
structure of the pileipellis. The particular shape and structure of the hymenophore could be
interpreted as aberrant, but the lack of pseudocystidia makes a position in Lactarius
unacceptable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A more recent definition of Arcangeliella is given by Thiers (1984). The main differences
with the type specimen of A. dolichocaulis are: pileus rarely becoming fully expanded;
margin typically attached to the stipe, breaking free at maturity (hard to observe in A. dolicho-
caulis as there are no young specimens, but the pileus is perfectly expanded and no trace of
an attachment is visible); gleba lamelliform with highly branched, intervenose lamellae
(and thus not without any geotropical orientation); cystidia usually present, often rare and
inconspicuous or differentiated as pseudocystidia or macrocystidia; pileipellis a differen-
tiated layer of more or less repent hyphae, a trichodermium, ixotrichodermium or a turf of
free hyphal tips.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Arcangeliella dolichocaulis thus differs from other representatives of Arcangeliella by
its agaricoid and fully expanded basidiome, the shape of the hymenophore and the lack of
cystidia. We therefore feel like placing it in a new genus (Porolactarius ad int.), but have
decided to wait for more records of this species, as thus far only a single carpophore is known.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In laboratory cultures Simocybe sumptuosa produces tiny slime drops with curved, binu-
cleate conidia and ellipsoid, terminal or fusiform intercalary, binucleate chlamydospores.
Chlamydospores occur also within the agar medium, but conidia do not. Noduli also
form, and in one culture a few basidiomes developed. The mycelium is significantly dens-
er beneath the noduli than between the noduli, Carpogenesis has been studied using stain-
ed microtome sections. Simocybe sumptuosa is exocarpic amphicleistoblemate.#Abstract*]

[@Mycelia of S. sumptuosa (P.D. Orton) Sing. grow well in petridishes on various media at
20°-—25°C, the most suitable ones being potato dextrose agar and oat meal agar. Two to
three weeks after inoculation the agar surface is covered with a mycelium bearing innu-
merable, very small droplets of milky white slime that contain strongly curved conidia and
ellipsoid aleuria. After another 3—4 weeks small, white pustules of aerial hyphac become
visible. These are the first stages of the noduli eventually leading to primordium formation.
The noduli soon overgrow neighbouring slime droplets. Most noduli cease further growth
and die, but in one culture on PDA a small number of brownish primordia and young basid-
iomes have developed. This culture has been left unattended for about 6 weeks on a bench
in the teaching laboratory where it became contaminated with bacteria that, unfortunately,
have not been characterised. Despite many efforts, no other culture ever produced primordia,
even when many noduli were present, but the material available allowed the analysis of
carpogenesis of S. sumptuosa, as well as some observations on the morphology of the
mycelium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Carpogenesis of Simocybe-species is poorly known. So far only one single primordium
of S. centunculus has been investigated (Reijnders, 1963: 82, as Naucoria centunculus). lt
was in a rather advanced developmental stage, and the only significant information that
could be gained is the presence of a rudimentary ‘partial veil’ that lead to the conclusion
that S. centunculus is *paravelangiocarpous . Since this primordium was collected in nature,
nothing is known about mycelial morphology and mitospores that might be formed by this
species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidiomes of S. sumptuosa (P. D. Orton) Sing. growing on deciduous wood were collect-
ed on September 6, 1995 by Dr. Beatrice Senn-Irlet in the Nijenrode Park, Breukelen, prov-
ince of Gelderland in Holland. Cultures were derived from a spore-print and are kept in
our laboratory under the access number BSI 95/68. It is available from the Centraalbureau
voor Schimmelcultures, The Netherlands, as strain CBS 102149.#Misc-exposition*]
[@408 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 3, 2000#Page-header*]

[@Potato dextrose agar (PDA) was prepared from dehydrated mashed potatoes following
Lacy & Bridgmon (1962) and distributed in 9 cm plastic petridishes. After inoculation the
dishes were sealed with Parafilm and incubated at approximately 20 °C ina 12h/12h light/
dark cycle.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Small agar blocks with noduli or young basidiomes were cut out and fixed in aldehyde
gas, dehydrated with methoxyethanol and embedded in a modified methacrylate mixture
(Clémengon, 1990, no ethyleneglycol dimethylether, diethyleneglycol monobutylether
replaced by 8% of terpineol, azoisobutyronitril replaced by 0.3% benzoyl peroxide and
0.04% N,N-dimethy] aniline). The terpineol acts as a softener, lessens the deteriorating ef-
fects of the benzoyl peroxide on the fungal cells and facilitates the removal of the gelatin
capsule from the methacrylate block. The gelatin can be peeled off like an egg shell from a
hard-boiled egg.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sections were cut at 5-7 µm thickness using a tungsten carbide knife on an ordinary rota-
ry microtome originally designed for cutting paraffin blocks. They were then placed on a
drop of distilled water saturated with terpineol on a microscope slide and dried on a hot
plate at roughly 60 °C. Before staining it is necessary to bake the sections onto the micro-
scope slides (placed in a staining rack) for 1-2 h at 115—120 °C. This evaporates some of
the terpineol in the embedding plastic (thus facilitating the penetration by the staining solu-
tions) and avoids blistering of the sections during the staining at the elevated temperature
used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Notes: If the washing with hot distilled water in steps 4 and 5 is too short then enough
AZ stays in the plastic to react with the haematoxylin resulting in a pink grey background
staining. If well washed, the methacrylate takes a yellow background staining that is easily
removed in steps 8 and 9. The tap water must be slightly alkaline (if not so add a trace of
sodium carbonate). If the sections have not been baked at 115-120 °C blisters will form#Misc-exposition*]

[@during hot staining. Hot staining is much quicker than staining at room temperature (which
takes 24—36 h) and assures uniform staining throughout the entire thickness of the section,
which is usually not the case in cold staining. The liquids (300 ml) are pre-heated in plastic
staining jars using a household microwave oven at 600 W for 90-95 seconds, but the sec-
tions themselves are not exposed to microwave treatment.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hyphal density in the agar has been estimated in microtome sections through the culture
medium after staining with AZ haematoxylin. Using the ‘threshold’, ‘make binary’ and
*skeletonize’ functions of the image analysis program NIH Image 1.62 by Wayne Rasband,
the total mass of the hyphae present in a selected area of the cross section is estimated as
the total number of black pixels. Since the hyphae are oriented at different angles with respect
to the plane of observation the hyphal mass is underestimated and represents only about
88% of the real value, as detailed analyses of a few images have shown. The surface photo-
graphed for analysis measured 529 µm x 395 µm = 0.209 mm2?, and the total hyphal length
contained in | mm2 of the section is therefore 4.785 times bigger. Since the sections are
5 µm thick, the total biomass in | mm? amounts to 200 times the mass contained in 1 mm?
of a section. As 1.44 pixels are equivalent to | µm, the mycelial mass contained in mm? of
agar can be expressed in µm. For each estimation 11 successive microtome sections have
been analysed. All estimates are made within the first 400 µm below the agar surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycelial morphology#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hyphae of the vegetative mycelium of S. sumptuosa are 2— 4.5 µm wide, thin walled
and roughly cylindrical. They bear clamp-connections at almost every septum, and the doli-
pore swelling is just visible in SDS Congo red (Clémengon, 1998), but the porus itself is
too narrow to be seen. The narrow growth front on the agar surface consists of more or less
parallel, radial hyphae, and the hyphal mat behind the growth front is woven from interlaced
hyphae. Within the agar the hyphae are loosely arranged and run in all directions, but in
cultures producing noduli the distribution is not uniform. Two different petridish cultures
producing noduli have been analysed. In the first culture the hyphal masses beneath two
noduli were 14.90 m/mm3 (SD = 1.63, N = 11) and 12.48 m/mm? (SD 2 0.97, N 2 11), as
compared to 7.26 m/mm? (SD - 1.03, N - 11) at acontrol site without nodulus. In a second
culture there were 10.9 m/mm? (SD - 1.58, N 2 11) beneath a nodulus and 4.41 m/mm?
(SD = 0.73, N = 11) under a site without nodulus. This means that beneath a nodulus there
are 1.7-2.5 times as many hyphae than at a location without a nodulus. These hyphal lengths
may be impressive, but assuming a mean hyphal diameter of 3 µm, the total hyphal volumes
amount to 10.4%, 8.7% and 5.1% of the agar volume for the first culture and to 7.6% and
3.1% for the second culture. All differences are statistically significant.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No special hyphal differentiations are visible beneath the noduli or at any other location
of the mycelium, but the contents of some hyphae and of a few chlamydospores stain brown
in iodine solution indicating the possible presence of glycogen. In cultures older than
4 months many empty hyphae with secondary septa can be seen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mitospores#Misc-exposition*]
[@Almost the entire surface becomes covered with tiny milky-white slime droplets that
contain strongly curved conidia and ellipsoid chlamydospores (Figs. 1-3. 12).#Misc-exposition*]
[@410 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 3, 2000#Page-header*]

[@Conidia are borne in short chains at the end of a hypha or in small clusters on the sides
of hyphae (Fig. 4). Several conidial chains form a slimy head (Fig. 5), as the conidia are
released by gelification of the wall of the mother hyphae. Conidia are binucleate and contain
lipids. The nuclei are already visible in water mounts and are strongly stained by cotton
blue in lactic acid (Fig. 6), iron aceto carmine and DAPI; the lipids can be stained with
Sudan III dissolved in lactophenol (Fig. 7). The conidial wall is very thin, inamyloid and
hardly stains in Congo red and Cotton blue. The clamp-connection often forms a small
asymmetrical blister at the base of the conidium (Fig. 8).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Besides terminal aleuria some intercalary, more or less fusiform chlamydospores are
present in the mycelium. Both types of chlamydospores are binucleate, contain large amounts
of lipids (Fig. 10) and bear a basal clamp-connection. The two nuclei can already be seen
in water mounts, become more distinct in iodine solutions and are deeply stained in Cotton
blue mounts. Chlamydospore walls are inamyloid, strongly cyanophilic and stain deeply
with Congo red. Toluidine blue does not stain the walls, even after heating the slides to the
boiling point.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Chlamydospores and conidia frequently occur in the same head (Fig. 9), and both are
present together in the same slime droplet.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidia are produced only on the agar surface, but chlamydospores are also formed deep
within the agar medium (Fig. 11).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In situ germination of chlamydospores has been observed, but this is a rare event. No at-
tempts have been made to estimate the germination rates on fresh media.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Noduli and carpogenesis#Description*]

[@Noduli are formed anywhere on the mycelium except near the centre of the culture. They
soon overgrow the slime drops and develop on top of them (Figs. 12, 13). Young noduli are
connected to the mycelium by a few hyphae and consist of a very loose web of undifferen-
tiated hyphae. On the surface some elongate vesicular cells are present (Fig. 13). Neigh-
bouring noduli may fuse and produce a single primordium (Fig. 19A). Mature noduli are
round cushion-shaped or roughly spherical and brown (Figs. 14, 17). They are densely woven
from thin-walled, cylindrical hyphae forming an irregular context with a few small air spaces.
Near the base some crystals form small clusters surrounded by a thin amorphous mass stain-
ing deeply with aluminium zirconium haematoxylin (Figs. 14, 15, 20, 21). The surface is
completely covered with a layer of radially arranged, inflated hyphae with vesicular-fusiform
end cells (Figs, 14, 16). This layer grows out from the nodulus context and can be named a
noduloblema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For the study of carpogenesis four representative primordia have been selected (Fig.
19). Primordium A consists of an erect shaft emerging from a nodulus and bearing a small
pileus initial (in the case figured the shaft actually emerges from two fused noduli, but this
is not the rule). Primordium B has grown a thin veil and a small pileus with a smooth pre-
hymenial palisade on its underside. In primordium C general enlargement of all parts has
started, and lamellae begin to develop. Primordium D has à very elongated stipe and a few
gills, but the partial veil has not grown noticeably.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 18 shows a primordium intermediate between C and D, but one which has not been
sectioned. The veil forms a woolly cover on the stipe and a thin fibrous cover on the pileus,
and a few hyphae bridge the gap between the pileus margin and the stipe. This veil consists
of a cauloblema, a pileoblema and an amphicleistoblema, as shown below.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Clemengon: Simocybe sumpruosa in laboratory cultures 411#Page-header*]

[@Primordium A — Carpogenesis starts with the formation of an erect shaft growing out
from the nodulus (Fig. 20). The bottom of the nodulus can be identified by the presence of
some crystals and the irregular arrangement of the hyphae (Fig. 23). The shaft does not
grow out from the surface of the nodulus but originates from its centre. Here the upward-
growing generative hyphae are very thin and loosely arranged. The region corresponding
to the centre of the nodulus shows some mucilage (Fig. 23), but higher up the shaft is exempt
of mucilage.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the upper half of the shaft the hyphae form a denser stipe initial with only a few small
air spaces. Towards the periphery the hyphae have begun to inflate and to form à tube of
denser context. The sides of the shaft are covered with a rudimentary cauloblema consisting
mainly of isolated vesicular hyphal end cells.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On top of the shaft is a small pileus initial consisting of a dense context woven from ir-
regularly arranged vegetative hyphae, but it is not sharply delimited from the stipe initial
(Fig. 22). It generates a voluminous pileoblema consisting of two zones that are easily distin-
guished although they are not distinctly separated. The inner zone resembles the nodulo-
blema in the radial arrangement of inflated hyphae with vesicular end cells. The outer zone
consists of periclinal hyphae also bearing vesicular end cells (Fig. 22). The development
of the primordia shows that the inner pileoblema becomes the pileipellis, whereas the outer
pileoblema contributes to the veil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Primordium B — Fig. 24 shows the general organisation of this developmental stage.
The total length has not increased significantly, but the pileus has formed and its underside
is lined with a smooth prehymenial palisade. The cauloblema and the pileoblema bridge
the gap between the pileus and the stipe thus creating an amphicleistoblema and a secondary
prehymenial cavity. This primordium confirms that the erect shaft (the future stipe) grows
from the centre of the nodulus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The growth direction of the hyphae of the metablemas is indicated by the orientation of
the vesicular end cells and can also be determined by looking at the clamp-connections,
whose open ends point away from the hyphal tips. A fine bundle of hyphae of the cauloblema
growing from the stipe surface over the pileus margin and showing many upright vesicular
end cells can be seen in Fig. 25. The hyphae of the cauloblema grow over a considerable
part of the pileus, and they intermingle with downward growing hyphae from the pileoblema,
as seen in Figs. 26A-D. The origin of the hyphae of the pileoblema is shown in Fig. 27.
Just below the prehymenial cavity many young hyphae rich in cytoplasm emerge from the
stipe surface and grow in the direction of the palisade. This is a young cauloblema (Figs.
28, 28A). A hypha of the cauloblema located on the pileus surface is visible in the same
photographs, its growth direction being indicated by the orientation of the clamp-connection
(Figs. 28, 28B, arrows). The cauloblema and the pileoblema intermingle on the pileus surface
(Fig. 29) and also on the stipe surface (Fig. 30).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileus margin begins to be differentiated, but it is not yet present on the entire circum-
ference of the pileus. It is only about 50 tum wide and its hyphae project beyond the level
of the prehymenial palisade (Fig. 31). Hyphae of the cauloblema not only grow on the pileus
surface, but some of them penetrate into the pileus margin (Fig. 32). The prehymenial pal-
isade forms a continuous ring around the stipe. Lamellae are not yet formed (Figs. 33, 34).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this developmental stage the hyphae begin to inflate as a means to increase the volume
of the basidiome, as documented in Figs. 36—40. The stipe consists of a lateral, tube-like
part consisting of short-celled, slightly inflated hyphae and a central pith with thin-walled,
faintly staining hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]
[@412 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 3, 2000#Page-header*]

[@Primordium C — The size increase is accompanied by inflation of most hyphae of the
central pileus context. Air spaces have also increased somewhat in the pileus, leading to a
less dense structure as compared to the primordium B (Fig. 42). The first thromboplerous
hyphae appear in the pileus context (Fig. 41). Many short hyphae grow out from the stipe
surface thus increasing the mass of the cauloblema (Fig. 48), but the outer pileoblema and
the cleistoblema have become thinner by the expansion of the pileus. As the stipe has not
yet stretched significantly, the structure of its context is the same as the one in primordium
B (Fig. 47). It is interesting to note that some medullar hyphae do not reach the pileus.
They bear slightly inflated terminal cells reminiscent of acrophysalides (Figs. 45, 46). The
first lamellae begin to form, as indicated by the bulge of the palisade in Fig. 49. The gill
trama is subregular and slightly divergent, and a few hyphae running roughly parallel to
the gill edge are also present (as is frequently the case in mature gills near the edge). The
palisade is evenly covering the young gills, without any indication of a differentiation on
the gill edge (Figs. 50, 51).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Primordium D — The stipe has much elongated and so have the cells of its lateral part
(Fig. 56). The pileus has expanded by further cell inflation and air space formation (Figs.
52, 53). The lamellae are now regular, radial, downward growing ridges with a subregular,
slightly diverging gill trama of cylindrical, not yet inflated hyphae (Fig. 54). The gill edges
are differentiated by the presence of vesicular cells, the future cheilocystidia. The pileoblema
and the cleistoblema have become scantier, but the cauloblema has increased its mass, not
by gaining in thickness, but by covering the total length of the stipe. Terminal hyphal end
cells in the medulla are confirmed (Fig. 57; compare Figs. 45 and 46).#Misc-exposition*]

[@CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycelial morphology is slightly changed during basidiome formation by an increase of
hyphal density in the nutrient agar beneath the noduli, but special structures, such as dense
masses of short cells filled with glycogen (e.g. in Coprinus trisporus, Clémencon, 1997:
846) are lacking.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Conidia and chlamydospores of Simocybe are described for the first time. The exact mech-
anism of conidiogenesis has not been discussed here. Therefore no attempt has been made
to identify the anamorph state with a genus of the Deuteromycetes. The chlamydospores
of S. sumptuosa are usually terminal aleuria, but some intercalary, irregularly fusiform chla-
mydospores are also formed. Clearly the two types are homologous variants of a single
mitospore. Conidia and chlamydospores may occur in the same mitosporogenic heads, but
the differentiating mechanism is unknown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In her monograph of the genus Simocybe Senn-Irlet (1995) wrote that a veil is lacking
or could never be seen in the material she studied. This may be true for mature basidiomes,
but as Reijnders (1963) showed for S. centunculus, a spurious veil is present in very young
fruit-bodies of this species. This is confirmed here for a species very close (if not identical)
to the one studied by Reijnders. Furthermore, in S. sumptuosa the origin and development
of the veil could be studied for the first time. This analysis shows clearly that the veil is not
a residual outer part of a matrix (i.e. it is not a rudimentary innate veil) but a new formation,
à metablema produced by the stipe and by the pileus. The cauloblema is independent from
the pileoblema, but both meet and intermingle on the lateral pileus surface and on the upper
stipe surface thus bridging the gap between the pileus margin and the stipe. The partial veil
is therefore a composite structure and can be termed an amphicleistoblema. Since there is
no matrix 5. sumptuosa is exocarpic amphicleistoblemate (terminology of Cl&mengon,
1997), or it may be called mixangiocarpic (terminology of Reijnders, 1963). This is in strong
contrast with the paravelangiocarpy proposed by Reijnders (1963: 82) for the similar
S. centunculus, but this author could not study very young specimens, and he did not pay
attention to the growth direction of the hyphae of the partial veil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A metablema is not necessarily equivalent to a ‘velum emanatum’ (Reijnders, 1963),
but it may also become a pileipellis, or it may result in two different organs, as illustrated
by S. sumptuosa, since the inner pileoblema turns into a pileipellis while the outer part
enters a cleistoblema.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since the stipe initial (the erect shaft) originates from the central part of the nodulus the
pileus initial could simply be the upper part of the nodulus that has been lifted on top of the
shaft. The presence of the same vesicular cells on the pileus initial would point in the same
direction. This *nodulopileate' developmental type is certainly conceivable and may perhaps
occur in nature, but it probably does not apply to S. sumptuosa, as the direct comparison of.
the structures of the nodulus and the pileus initial reveals differences in hyphal diameter
and hyphal spacing (Figs. 22 & 23).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Figs. 19A -D suggest that after having formed the erect shaft the pileus is formed while
the total length of the primordium does not increase significantly. Only after completion of
the pileus formation (but without the gills) does growth continue. But since the develop-
mental stages A —D are not from a single primordium, the suggested pattern must remain a
hypothesis that should be tested using time lapse cinematography.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Previous papers of this series deal with the section Phoma (De Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992;
De Gruyter et al., 1993, 1998), Peyronellaea (Boerema, 1993), Plenodomus (Boerema et
al., 1994, 1996 and Boerema & de Gruyter, 1999), Heterospora (Boerema et al., 1997, 1999)
and Sclerophomella (Boerema & de Gruyter, 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The section Phyllostictoides was introduced by Van der Aa et al. (1990). The infrageneric
name was adopted from a cultural study by Zerbele (1971), who proposed it as a provisional
name of a ‘group-like section’ without a Latin description (personal information from Dr.
V.A. Mel'nik, St. Petersburg). The section name was formally validated by Boerema: Phoma
sect. Phyllostictoides Zerbele ex Boerema (Boerema, 1997). It comprised species with pyc-
nidia similar to those of the section PAoma: thin-walled, pseudoparenchymatous, glabrous
but sometimes with hyphal outgrowths, a predetermined opening or ostiole, but sometimes
remaining closed for a long time with final formation of a pore. The conidia have a broad
range of shapes and sizes and are mainly aseptate in vitro, but in vivo the larger conidia
often become two or even more celled by secondary septation (see Fig. 1). The percentage
of septate conidia depends on environmental conditions and may vary in vivo between 5
and 95 (Van der Aa & van Kesteren, 1979). Under normal laboratory conditions the majority
of conidia always remain aseptate in vitro, but usually some two- or more-celled conidia
also occur.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Section Phyllostictoides includes species with and without chlamydospores; if present
they are unicellular, solitary or formed in series or complexes. Many species of this section
are anamorphs of species of Didymella Sacc. The type species of section Phyllostictoides
is Phoma exigua Desm. Zerbele (1971) used the synonym Ascochyta althaeina Sacc. &
Bizz., see Van der Aa & van Kesteren (1971).#Misc-exposition*]

[@new host genus, and placed in the coelomycetous genera Phoma, Phyllosticta and Ascochyta,
due to the rigid application of criteria used in the Saccardoan system for anamorph genera.
In this contribution nomenclature and synonymy of this species and a number of infraspecific
taxa is given and their characters in vivo and in vitro are described. The subspecific taxonomy
is supported by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism studies (AFLP), which will be
published separately (Abeln et al., in press).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Methods are as described in De Gruyter & Noordeloos (1992) and De Gruyter et al.
(1993). In combination with other characteristics, the presence (+) or absence (—) of a colour-
less metabolite known as ‘antibiotic E’ is a useful diagnostic criterium for species of Phoma.
The production of 'E' was first described from ubiquitous strains of Phoma exigua (E is
derived from exigua), see Boerema & Hóweler (1967). It can be demonstrated by adding a
drop of concentrated NaOH to the margin of colonies on MA which produces an initial
blue-green colour reaction, turning to brownish-red (oxidation reaction). Logan & O'Neill
(1970) showed the metabolite to have bactericidal and fungicidal properties. The production
of ‘antibiotic E’ is stimulated by light, so that the NaOH-test is best examined after the
plates have been exposed to daylight for several days.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Isolates and original samples studied are present in herbarium and culture collections of
CBS, Baarn and the Plant Protection Service, PD, Wageningen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Synonyms in the respective genera Phoma, Ascochyta and Phyllosticta are listed in chro-
nological order, and within the year in alphabetical order. The bulk of the synonyms was
originally described in the genus Phyllosticta; this fits well with the name of the section.
The synonyms described in the genus Phyllosticta are only briefly explicated, usually with-
out information about host plant and the type specimen. All will be treated in more detail
by Van der Aa, who will publish a revision of all species described in the genus PAyllosticta
Pers. s.l. Herbaria and culture collections are abbreviated according to the codes in the
Index Herbariorum (Holmgren et al., 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It should be noted that only synonyms which have not been published previously are in-
cluded. A complete synonymy will be published later in the monograph of the genus Phoma
by Boerema et al.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution. Phoma exigua var. exigua is a world-wide recorded wound
and weak parasitic soil fungus, which in Eurasia has been isolated from more than 200
host genera. The fungus is an opportunistic plant parasite which may cause necroses on
leaves and stems, and may produce a rot on fleshy roots and tubers, or at the bases of leaves
and stems: Leaf- and Stem Necroses, Pod spot of legumes, Root Rot of carrot, chichory
etc., Gangrene of potatoes, Tuber Rot of dahlia, Foot Rot of lettuce etc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On dying plant substrates, in the close proximity of soil, itis the most common pyenidial
fungus found in Europe. The extensive synonymy can be explained by the unlimited pluriv-
orous character of the fungus and its extreme variability in size and septation of conidia.
Notable are the many specific “host-indicating names’, formerly described in the genus
Phyllosticta.#Misc-exposition*]

in the early seventies it was still not known that various strains or varieties of P. exigua do
not produce the metabolite E.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cultural characteristics of the Dutch isolate CBS 372.75 deposited in 1975 (PD 75/

[@In summary, Stem Blight and Leaf Spot of Vinca is not associated with one host-specific
‘inoxydabilis’ -variety of P. exigua. The listed synonyms may also refer to different strains
of P. exigua. This conclusion agrees with the experimental study of the Vinca disease by
Jansen (1965). She obtained the typical leaf spots and dieback of shoots after inoculating
with isolates from Vinca spp., as well as with an arbitrary isolate of P. exigua (from Dahlia
tuber rot). She supposed that the relevant disease of Vinca is primarily induced by unfavour-
able environmental conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phoma exigua 'var. capsici L.Z. Liang’, Acta Microbiol. sin. 31 (2) (1991) 161 [nom. inval.].#Nomenclature*]

[@This infraspecific taxon, based on pathogenic Phoma isolates from seeds of Capsicum
annuum in Beijing, China, was introduced without a Latin description and type indication.
Therefore this varietal name is not validly published (ICBN Arts 36.1, 37.1-5).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the English summary of the Chinese paper by Liang (1.c.) the cultures of the fungus
were characterized as black tinged, relatively fast growing with a regular margin, and show-
ing no colour reaction with NaOH (no production of antibiotic E). Further is noted that the
fungus “does not agree with any of the 5 described varieties of P. exigua by Boerema &
Hóweler (1967), except for morphological similarity of conidia". In pathogenicity tests it
"could produce round or irregular lesions on leaves". The annotation that the fungus "was
found in 21 seed samples of Capsicum annuum out of 30 tested with infection ranging from
0.5-65.5%”, points to a true pathogen. Without a representative culture it is difficult to
give a justified opinion on the identity of the pathogen. However, it should be noted that
seeds of Capsicum annuum may be severely infected by Phoma destructiva Plowr.
(Neergaard, 1956), a fungus often confused with P. exigua (c. g. in Japan), see Boerema &
van Kesteren (1981). Phoma destructiva produces also dark colonies with a regular margin
and gives no colour reaction with NaOH. It may cause foliar lesions and fruit rot (source of
seed infection).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the last few years the species of genus Agaricus L. occurring in the Netherlands and
adjacent regions have been revised for the Flora agaricina neerlandica. Since the excellent
work of Moller (1950, 1952), no revision has been carried out in north western Europe.
The present research has revealed that more names exist than species, and a number of
taxa have been synonymised. Also, some names which are in use at present have proved to
be homonyms or superfluous, and some name changes have become necessary.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus fissuratus is considered conspecific with A. arvensis. Although forms with an
ochraceous, fissurate cap which match the original description of A. fissuratus are found in
the Netherlands, these are probably ecological modifications, caused by weather or habitat.
Likewise, several intermediate forms can be found between A. leucotrichus, in its typical
form with an entirely fibrillose-squamulose pileus, and A. arvensis, with a smooth pileus.
Itis not unlikely, however, that in the future advanced methods will reveal more taxa within

pale-coloured form which was provisionally named var. alba nom. prov. by Moser (1967)

7509) which matches the original description also in microscopical characters, the taxonom-
ical status and place of this species which only differs in spore size is too doubtful to in-
clude it as a separate taxon. Further collections are required to come to a more definitive
conclusion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ADDITIONS TO COPRINUS SUBSECTION LANATULI#Misc-exposition*]

[@C.B. ULJÉ!. F. DOVERI? & M.E. NOORDELOOS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two new Coprinus taxa in subsection Lanatuli, C. candidolanatus and C. lagopus var.
vacillans, are described with an updated key to the subsection.#Abstract*]

[@In 1988 an unknown Coprinus species was found in the Netherlands, seemingly belonging
to the subsection Lanatuli on account of the hairy veil, microscopically composed of chains
of sausage-shaped elements. However, clusters of diverticulate elements were also found
in the veil, a feature that makes the taxon intermediate between the subsections Lanatudi
Sing. and Alachuani Sing. This anomaly in conjunction with the fact that only a small, sin-
gle collection was in our possession led us to omit the species from a recent Coprinus study
of the subsection Lanatuli (Uljé & Noordeloos, 1999). Recently a large number of basidio-
carps similar to those of our initial find has been collected in Italy so we now describe the
new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second Coprinus taxon, frail and “shaky on its legs’ even in the young stage, has been
known to the first author for a long time, although young specimens were so difficult to
find that a good collection has only been made recently. This undescribed but rather common
taxon, growing in lawns and having a very supple stipe, is here considered a new variety of
C. lagopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The very fragile basidiocarps, the habitat, the usually somewhat less slender spores (often
slightly wider than broader) than in C. lagopus var. lagopus Fr.: Fr., and the thin wall of the
stipe are the main characters by which to recognize C. lagopus var. vacillans. lt is difficult
to collect young basidiocarps in the field by reason of the very rapid developing and wilting
of the pileus. Although the pure (silvery) white stipe is very fragile, it does not disappear
as quickly as the pileus and stipes can be found, often in great number, lying on the ground
with a black, snotty remnant of the pileus at their extremities. The stipe bends down as
soon as it starts to grow, even while the pileus is still closed. Microscopically the wall
of the stipe is often thinner than 200 µm, though sometimes reaching 240 µm, whereas in
C. lagopus var. lagopus it usually lies between 200 and 450 µm. Nonetheless, most micro-
scopical features are rather similar to C. lagopus so we prefer at the moment to describe it
as a new variety rather than to erect a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leucoagaricus crystallifer spec. nov. is described; this species was formerly known as
L. serenus in the interpretation of Bon and other authors. Leucoagaricus serenus sensu
Kühner is neotypified, and the following new combinations are made: Leucoagaricus
sericifer, and L. sericifer f. sericatellus.#Abstract*]

[@Leucoagaricus subg. Sericeomyces (Heinem.) M. Bon consists of rather elegant, mostly
white species, with a dry or slightly viscid pileus covering which is made up of adnate to
ascending radiaily arranged hyphae. The species look disconcertingly similar in the field,
and only microscopical examination reveals the differences. Cheilocystidia, pileus covering,
and to a lesser extent, spores, yield the best characters for identification. However, spore
shape and size are very variable, in part due to the presence of 2- or 1-spored basidia. Further-
more, the number of misshapen spores is often quite high, as it is in sect. Rubrotincti Sing.
p. p. [L. sublittoralis (Kiihner ex Hora) Sing. and allies]. The shape of the spores changes
late during the maturation process; as a result, spores which are still on the lamella when
examined, might have a slightly different shape from those which have been discharged,
and studied in a spore print or on the stipe or pileus surface.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite the facts that Bon (1993) gave an overview of all taxa published up to that date
in Europe, and that several taxa have been described since (c.g. Sericeomyces cinereo-
pallidus by Contu, 1994; S. sardous by Zecchin & Migliozzi, 1998), there still is confusion
about the interpretation of names and not all collections can be assigned to a species. The
name Leucoagaricus serenus (Fr.) Bon & Boiffard has been used for several different
species; this history is here unraveled, L. serenus neotypified, and a second taxon currently
known under that name is described as a new species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Due to the application of phylogenetics based on sequences of ribosomal nuclear Large
Subunit (LSU) and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) (e.g. Hopple & Vilgalys, 1999;
Moncalvo et al., 2000), systematics of the Agaricales in general and of the family Agarica-
ceae (Johnson & Vilgalys, 1998; Johnson, 1999; Vellinga, in prep.) are quite unsettled and
turbulent. Furthermore, the trend in systematics is to arrive at a rankless classification based
on phylogenetics (e.g. de Queiroz & Gauthier, 1992, 1994; Hibbett & Donoghue, 1998;
Pleijel, 1999). In view of these recent developments, my preference would be to refrain
from making new combinations, and from placing the new species in a genus. However,
the present survey has a practical aspect in the form of a contribution to the Flora agaricina
neerlandica, in which all species have to be placed in a genus. As there are strong indications
that Sericeomyces Heinem. does not form a monophyletic group (Vellinga, in prep.), a#Misc-exposition*]

[@There are four different interpretations of the name 'serenus'. Fries (1874) described it
as a beautiful white mushroom, without giving any microscopic details. In this group of
macroscopically extremely similar, white, non-viscid species, microscopical characters are
the only differentiating characters. Lange (1935) interpreted Lepiota serena as a species
with striking, lageniform cheilocystidia; this species is now commonly known as Sericeo-
myces sericifer (Locq.) Dossing. Kühner (1936) denounced this interpretation, and used
the name 'serenus' for a species with broadly clavate cheilocystidia. This interpretation
has generally been followed (Huijsman, 1943; Wichansky, 1959; Malencon & Bertault,
1970; Wuilbaut, 1986), though of course it has been used for several other species. Pearson#Misc-exposition*]

[@(1949) misinterpreted the name for a species he was later (in 1952) to describe as L. pin-
guipes. a robust species with ellipsoid spores, close to L. leucothites ( Vittad.) Wasser. Several
authors (Bon, 1981, 1993; Rodríguez Armas et al., 1988; Lange, 1995; Candusso, 1990;
Migliozzi & Bizzi, 1995) gave a fourth interpretation. In their descriptions the cheilocystidia
are narrowly clavate, with crystals at the apex. Rodríguez Armas et al. (1988) expressed
severe doubt whether this really was S. serenus; this doubt was supported by Malengon (in
Rodríguez Armas et al., 1988). but Bon affirmed the determination (but of course, Bon
used the name 5. serenus for this taxon). In the descriptions given by Candusso (1990),
Migliozzi & Bizzi (1995), and Breitenbach & Kränzlin (1995) the cheilocystidia are rather
wide, wider than in the more typical collections, and their collections might belong to a
different taxon, e.g. L. menieri (Sacc.) Sing. Moser (1983) merged the two interpretations,
as he stated that ‘sterile hairs are clavate or cylindrical’. The species with narrow cystidia
with crystals on the top is here described as new, viz. as L. crystallifer. The second species,
Leucoagaricus serenus (Fr.) Bon & Boiffard, is neotypified here in agreement with the
interpretations of Kühner (1936) and Huijsman (1943) with the following collection: ‘the
Netherlands, prov. Limburg, Cadier en Keer, Órenberg. 4-X- 1989, E.C. Vellinga 1604 (L)’.

[@Leucoagaricus crystallifer was commonly known as L. serenus (see also discussion under
the latter, and the misapplied names). However, it is easily separated from that species by
the narrow, slightly thick-walled cheilocystidia with a distinct crystalliferous apex.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sericeomyces cinereopallidus Contu comes close, has also relatively narrow, but thick-
walled, cheilocystidia with coarse crystals at the top, but the pileus is pale grey, at least at
centre, and viscid (Contu, 1994; Migliozzi, 1998).#Nomenclature*]

[@Three species, viz. Leucoagaricus menieri, L. subvolvatus (Mal. & Bert.) M. Bon, and
Sericeomyces singeri M. Bon ex Contu & Signor., are closely related to L. crystallifer, as
they all have crystals on the cystidia. All three species were described from sandy habitats
in the Mediterranean region; they all have a bulbous base, with volval remnants present in
L. menieri and L. subvolvatus, and they differ from each other in spore shape and the extent
to which the pileus covering is differentiated (Bon, 1993; Signorello & Contu, 1998). These
characters, and the shape of the cystidia, differentiate them from L. crystallifer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leucoagaricus crystallifer is not uncommon in the Netherlands, and has been collected
both in the dune area, and in southern Limburg. Surprisingly, Kelderman (1994) did not

[@This taxon has been considered a species by some authors (Malengon in Malengon &
Bertault, 1970; Bon, 1980, 1981, 1993), by others a variety of L. sericifer (Heinemann,
1978). The main characters to separate the two taxa are the number of spores per basidium
(4 in L. sericifer, and 2 in L. sericatellus), and the shape of the cheilocystidia: big, and
distinctly lageniform with a long neck and a slightly widened capitulum in £L. sericifer, and
relatively small and lacking a widened capitulum in L. sericatellus. Bon (1980) warned of
the existence of variants with a high number of 2-spored basidia in L. sericifer. The col-
lections examined for this study yielded a huge variation in shape and size of the cheilo-
cystidia, combined with 2-spored and 4-spored basidia (Figs. 3 & 4). Collections exist with
4-spored basidia and relatively small cystidia, alongside collections with 2-spored basidia
and big ‘typical’ sericifer cheilocystidia, and all intermediates. Crystals on the cystidia were
never found, though are reportedly present in L. sericifer (e.g. Kelderman, 1994), Another
difference between the two taxa is said to be the size of the trama elements, relatively narrow
in L. sericifer, and relatively broad in L. sericatellus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena cecidiophila is newly described and illustrated. It grows on knopper galls on
the cups of Quercus robur, and was collected from a single site in the Netherlands, Huys
ten Donck estate. Although the new species resembles a species of sect. Sacchariferae,
it differs in the negative Melzer-reaction on the lamella trama. The new section Cecidio-
philae is therefore proposed here to accommodate the new species, characterized by warty
elements of the pileipellis, amyloid spores, and absence of pleuro- and cheilocystidia.#Abstract*]

[@During a foray of a local working group of the Dutch Mycological Society an interesting
species of Mycena was collected in *Huys ten Donck’ estate at Ridderkerk, Zuid-Holland
province, The Netherlands. Under a row of Quercus robur L. a large number of old knopper
galls (outgrowths on acorn cupules caused by the gall-wasp Andricus quercuscalicis) were
found, some of which carried one or more small white fruit-bodies of Mycena. Although
these fruit-bodies were at first reminiscent of M. adscendens, which occurred on some of
the twigs among the galls, they were different upon closer inspection. Under a magnifying
glass (10 x) the fully expanded pileus showed a consistently brownish centre and a conspicu-
ously fimbriate margin. The stipe was entirely pruinose with a slightly bulbous base. Micro-
scopic examination revealed a complete lack of lamellar cystidia. The species could not be
keyed out using the monograph of Maas Geesteranus (1992) as it did not seem to fit in any
of the defined sections. It is therefore described here as new, and a new section is proposed
to accommodate it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena cecidiophila has a number of characters which would place it in sect. Sacchari-
ferae, in particular the type of pileipellis with acanthocyst terminal elements and amyloid
spores. However, all members of this section have well-differentiated cheilocystidia (Des-
jardin, 1995), with the exception of M. incarnativelum Desjardin. More important is the
fact that our species does not have amyloid or dextrinoid trama, which is considered an
essential feature of sect. Sacchariferae (Desjardin, 1995; Maas Geesteranus, 1983; Maas
Geesteranus & de Meyer, 1997, 1998). The combination of warty elements in the pileipellis,
amyloid spores, absence of cheilocystidia, 4-spored basidia, and negative Melzer-reaction
of the lamellar trama does not fit any other section in the classification of Maas Geesteranus
(1992). The absence of cheilocystidia suggests a place in sect. Radiatae, but in that section#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type locality at the private 'Huys ten Donck' estate is renowned for its mycoflora.
To date nearly 500 species have been recorded, many of which are included in the Red List
of endangered macrofungi in the Netherlands ( Arnolds & Kuyper, 1996). A variety of (prima-
rily deciduous) old trees and shrubs grows on à rich clayey soil. Only a limited number of
visitors is allowed access and maintenance is 'fungus-friendly'. A local working group of
the Dutch Mycological Society (Working Group Oud-Beijerland) has been organising more
or less regular forays to update the old records, during one of which our find was collected.
The galls were at least one year old, embedded in litter under various shrubs, and soaking
wet due to a period of continuous damp weather. After collecting the galls the fruit-bodies
soon collapsed and turned brownish.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the type locality several knopper galls bearing 1 to 3 fruit-bodies were found. Return
visits yielded a few more specimens. Most remarkably, they seemed to be associated exclu-
sively with this type of gall. Some small twigs among the galls carried M. adscendens, but
nota single instance of mixed occurrence was noted. This suggests that the substrate might
be typical for this species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@If the new species were truly confined to the knopper gall substrate, it would be a rare
species in nature. Knopper galls appear as irregular outgrowths of acorn cups of Quercus
robur or Q. petraea. They are the result of an infection by the agamic generation of the gall
wasp Andricus quercuscalicis (Burgsd.). To accommodate the sexual generation, the life
cycle of this organism requires a nearby second host (Q. cerris L.), which is far less common
(planted in parks and lanes). This restricts the occurrence of this type of gall and consequently
that of any putatively associated fungus species. In the type locality a few Q. cerris trees
are indeed present.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To our surprise it was easy to grow more fruit-bodies on the galls by keeping them embed-
ded in soaked humus in a simple transparent container with small holes at a moderately lit
spot at home at temperatures around 17°C. Within days after collection a first flush of new
fruit-bodies was obtained. Unfortunately the true significance of our find was not imme-
diately recognised and most of the early material was not retained. Occasional basidiocarps
continued to appear for several months. At first the only other visibly recognisable fungus
species was Ciboria batschiana which is specific to the interior tissue of old acorns. Fructifi-
cation seemed critically dependent on keeping the galls and the humus bed soaked. A later
collection of galls from the same site also produced occasional fruit-bodies. On forays at
other estates more knopper galls were found, suggesting a general abundance of this type
of plant disease during the previous fruiting season [knopper gall occurrence shows strong#Misc-exposition*]

[@yearly fluctuation, according to H.A. van der Aa (pers. comm.)]. However, no specimens
of the new Mycena species were found. Galls collected at these sites and kept under the
same conditions as described above did not develop any fruit-bodies. After two months
only a few fruit-bodies of M. galopus developed on the additional gall collections.#Misc-exposition*]

a fruit-body, and a well-developed receptacle with a ciliated margin and several rows of
connate hairs below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In an unpublished series of exact ascospore counts in multi-spored strains of Thelebolus
and Ascozonus the first author could confirm the constant spore number within any given
strain as found by Wicklow & Malloch (1971) in Thelebolus. As a result of successive mito-
ses the spore number found was up to 2^, with the restriction that, as in 8-spored asco-
mycetes, sometimes in a certain line one or a few abortive spores are produced.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Little attention has been paid to the early development of the ascomata in species of
Ascozonus. The descriptions and images published by Renny (1871, 1873, 1874) suggest
the presence of paragymnohymenial ascomata (Van Brummelen, 1967), but in A. monascus
the ascogenous system is extremely reduced; neither remnants of an ascogonium nor of an
antheridium could be found near the base of young asci. As in Lasiobolus monascus Kimbr.,
the ascus directly develops from the ascogonium (Kimbrough, 1974; Kimbrough & Benny,
1978). In the early stages the ascogonium and the ascus-mother-cell are completely sur-
rounded by excipular cells (Fig. 1D). During the prohymenial or early mesohymenial phase
these cleistohymenial ascomata open and the hymenium, here consisting of a single ascus
surrounded by several paraphyses, becomes exposed. The ripening ascus shows a restricted
receptacle at its base, and remains enclosed with a tight single layer of appressed paraphyses
(Fig. 1C).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The operculum at the top of mature asci is often found encircled by an irregular collar
consisting of the swollen ends of twelve to twenty paraphyses (Fig. 1B).#Misc-exposition*]

[@While the operculum in most species of Ascozonus shows a diameter of 2 to 3 µm, it
reaches a width of 5 to 9 µm in the present species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Studies of ascus apex ultrastructure in species of Ascozonus (Van Brummelen, 1974,
1978, 1994, 1998) revealed a most peculiar and constant apical apparatus described as the
Ascozonus type. The Ascozonus type of ascus apical structure shows clear resemblance to
both the Thelebolus type and the Octospora type by the presence of a subapical ring in the
lateral ascus wall at some distance below the ascus tip; while in Ascozonus and Thelebolus#Misc-exposition*]

microscopy, or post-mortem water imbibition of wall layers.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Samuelson (1978) in a study of the ascus apical apparatus in representatives of the
Pyronemataceae, studied the ascus of A. woolhopensis (Renny) E.C. Hansen. He failed to

in this species most clearly resembled that of Anthracobia melaloma (Alb. & Schw.: Fr.)

[@Catatrama costaricensis, previously known only from the type specimen, is described
and illustrated based on collections from Kerala state, India.#Abstract*]

[@Recently, whilst surveying the agaric flora of Kerala, an interesting fungus was collected
in one of the sacred groves of Kerala. Macroscopically the fungus had the appearance of a
species of Lepiota, but detailed studies revealed that it belonged to the genus Catatrama
(Tricholomataceae) described from Costa Rica (Franco-Molano, 1991). The collection is
described and illustrated below. The description is based on fresh specimens collected by
the authors. Colour terminology used is that of Methuen (Kornerup & Wanscher, 1967).
Specimens are deposited at the Mycological Herbarium of the Microbiology Division,
TBGRI (TBGT) and part at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fig. 1. Catatrama costaricensis. A. Habit x 1, B. basidia; C. spores, Bar = 10 µm.#Figure*]

[@The genus Catatrama was established to accommodate a single species, C. costaricensis
Franco-Molano, an interesting white-spored agaric with a lepiotoid habit, collected on soil
in Quercus pilaris Trel. forest in southern Costa Rica (Franco-Molano, 1991). The fungus
has distinguishing characters: a combination of echinulate, cyanophilic, inamyloid basidio-
spores, subfree lamellae and bilateral hymenophoral trama. Comparison with the description
of the type specimen reveals a good match of our material. Other than the original collection
from Costa Rica, no further report of its occurrence has been published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is the first of a series, and aims to provide information on the genus Coprinus.
The main part of the book is occupied by an alphabetical list of species in this genus with a
reference to the original publication and often the original diagnosis, accompanied by a
few copies of original plates. Furthermore it comprises a list with abbreviations of the cited
journals and books, a list of taxa with an enumeration of the abbreviated publications in
which the taxa are treated and, in alphabetical order of the author, a list of those publications.
The rest of the book contains a copy of 'Nomenclator fungorum' by W.M. Streinz (1862),
containing data on Coprinus, a list of publications concerning Coprinus in Italy, distribution-
maps of Coprinus species in Italy, and — in Italian as well as in English — a treatise of
fimicolous Coprinus in Italy, with a dichotomous key to the species, observations and -
sometimes — descriptions on species, accompanied by line-drawings. In this last part of the
book comments are made on all known fimicolous species of Coprinus in Europe, even
though they are not all included in the key.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This is a valuable book and has surely costed a lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, as
nearly always, the part with the original diagnoses is not entirely complete. Some easy-to-
find combinations are missing, like for example Coprinus calvescens (Berk.) Manjula, 1983,
from others the original diagnoses were not found by the authors. It would have been
advisable if the authors had contacted some libraries abroad where the missing literature
might have been available. But these are minor remarks, this book is recommended for the
amateur and professional who is interested in Coprinus, and will save a lot of time, though
the author and literature references still need to be checked.#Misc-exposition*]

protected areas is a multiple of the amount in the areas used for forestry, both not very
surprising conclusions. The research has been carried out in one of the remnants of a mixed
