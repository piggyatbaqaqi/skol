[@NOTES ON CREPIDOTUS
FROM MEXICO AND THE SOUTH-EASTERN USA#Misc-exposition*]

[@IRMGARD KRISAI-GREILHUBER!, BEATRICE SENN-IRLET? & HERMANN VOGLMAYR!#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thirteen Crepidotus taxa collected in Mexico and the south-eastern USA are described
and illustrated. One new infraspecific taxon of C. croceitinctus is proposed, var. auran-
tiacus. Type material of C. ellipsoideus and C. occidentalis has been re-examined.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Systematics Agenda 2000 (Anonymus, 1994) is a fierce call to discover and describe
the global species diversity. Many undescribed species still await detection especially among
the fungi from tropical and subtropical regions. However, the situation is not the same in
all genera, some as the genus Crepidotus (Fr.) Staude in the Americas are fairly well known
due to the contributions of Singer (1973) and Hesler & Smith (1965). Recent investigations
(Senn-Irlet & de Meijer, 1998; Bandala et al., 1999; Bandala & Montoya, 2000a, b) have
contributed to a better understanding of the variability of several species and the identity
with European material but have not revealed many new species. This study aims to add
additional observations towards a predictive classification system in Crepidotus. Further,
it is a small contribution to the knowledge of Mexican fungi and to the All-Taxa-Biodiver-
sity-Inventory in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina,
which is an extensive biodiversity project in the USA (Norvell, 1999; Kaiser, 1999). Two
of us (IK and HV) could profit from an invitation to Mexico and the south-eastern USA in
1996, during which 18 collections of the genus Crepidotus were made, belonging to 13
taxa. Besides common species, like C. applanatus, some more rare taxa, e.g. C. cinnabari-
nus, were found and one new infraspecific taxon of C. croceitinctus is proposed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopic structures were observed in dried material. Fragments of the carpophore
were mounted in Congo red, heated and examined in 5% KOH. Per collection 20 spores
were measured and the population limits estimated (see Senn-Irlet, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The macroscopic descriptions are from the first and third author, respectively; the first
author provided colour slides of all collections, and the second author is responsible for
the microscopic examinations and the identification. The material is kept in WU (Vienna
University herbarium) and in TENN (University of Tennessee, Knoxville). Within the two
subgenera the taxa are arranged alphabetically.#Misc-exposition*]

[@When covered completely with red-brown scales as in coll. 6620 and with an elastic
consistency, this species is easily recognised already in the field. However, the density of
red-brown scales may vary greatly in this species, as in coll. 66/5 where the coloured scales
were hardly visible on the fresh watery carpophores, but distinctly visible in the microscopic
examination,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Singer (1973), in his ‘stirps mollis’, tried to describe this great variation in thickness of
the gelatinous layers, in the density of the brownish scales and in the shape pattern of the
cheilocystidia with several species and infraspecific names. Coll. 6620 would key out under
C. calolepis ssp. tigrensis var. januarius, and coll. 6675 under C. variisporus, however with-
out the characteristic variable spore forms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This group around Crepidotus mollis and C. calolepis is best recognised with a rather
broad species concept. Species of this group show a world-wide distribution and are fre-
quently found fruiting. Morphological studies of accidentally sampled carpophores seem
hardly ever to give a sound classification. First results of molecular analyses of the genetic
diversity of the large subunit of ribosomal DNA (Senn-Irlet & Hofstetter, 1996, plus unpub-
lished results) show little variation, indicating a very close relationship at least of these
analysed collections. Crossing experiments are still lacking.#Misc-exposition*]

intense colours is also seen in the microscopic analysis. The presence of such yellow exu-
dates forming amorphous clumps is not mentioned in any of the studies mentioned. In other
collections of C. croceitinctus previously examined (Senn-Irlet & de Meijer, 1998) no such

(20002) describe a more or less loose turf of erect hyphae mixed with some very undifferen-
tiated pileocystidia, they do not mention such a unique type within the genus as found in

same taxon on account of the other fully matching characters, especially the dense turf of
pileocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

has already been noted by several authors but only the comparative study of Bandala &

of the cheilocystidia differs from our collection: whereas the holotype exhibits throughout
cylindrical, slightly flexuous cheilocystidia of 34—55 x 5-7 µm (as described and depicted
by the authors!) our collection has shorter, thicker and in shape more variable ones. More

[@With Singer (1973) this collection keys out as Crepidotus luridus var. oaxacae Singer
on account of the combination of subglobose warty spores and vesiculose cheilocystidia.
A figure even illustrates the shape of the pileocystidioid terminal cells. With the exception
of the substrate — not palms — the characters are the same as for Crepidotus palmarum. A
careful comparison of the different types led Bandala et al. (1999) to conclude that these
species are conspecific. We agree with this conclusion as also our observations on a collection
from Brazil growing on decayed leaf petioles of a palm tree (Senn-Irlet & de Meijer, 1998)
show a striking similarity with the Mexican specimen.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This collection shows a feature encountered in several, especially tropical specimens of
Crepidotus: the hymenium is full of cystidioid elements, which can be termed as pleuro-
cystidia (Hesler & Smith, 1965). As we firmly believe that such elements do not deserve
any taxonomic status because they may simply be a modification due to climatic conditions
or unknown biotic triggers (bacteria?) we abandon even the idea of describing a variety of
this species as this has been done by several authors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3) It should be noted that at present also included in Pyrenochaeta are species producing both undifferen-
tiated discrete conidiogenous cells and conidiogenous cells integrated on branched conidiophores in
a single pycnidium, c.g. Pyrenochaeta corni (Bat. & A.F. Vital) Boerema et al. (1996) and Pyrenochaeta
dolichi Mohanty (1958). With reference to the discussion of the taxonomic position of the latter by
Grondona et al. (1997) we now think that these species can be better treated as 'setose species’ of
Pleurophoma Hóhn. Our recent isolates of the type species of that genus, Pleurophoma pleurospora
(Sacc.) Hóhn., and the related Pleurophoma cava (Schulzer) Boerema ct al. (1996) also showed the
presence of both undifferentiated and integrated conidiogenous cells. All these species have probably
more affinity with Phoma than with true species of Pyrenochaeta (teleomorph, where known, belong-
ing to Herpotrichia Fuckel, see Schneider, 1979). Concerning Pyrenochaeta dolichi, Grondona et al.

[@Ecology and distribution. This well-known causal organism of Pink Root of onion (Allium
cepa) is apparently a widely distributed soil fungus in North America (USA and Canada)
and probably also a common soil inhabitant in some regions of South America (Argentina,
Brazil, Venezuela). Records from Europe, Africa and Australia are generally associated
with the cultivation of onions or other crops of Allium (leek, shallot, garlic and chive). The
fungus is frequently isolated from the roots of grasses (e.g. Setaria lutescens) and other
herbaceous plants, but usually without any disease symptoms. However, the roots of maize
plants (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) may also be affected. The fungus is characterized
by a red pigment in the mycelium and this easily distinguishes it from the morphologically
very similar Phoma leveillei Boerema & Bollen var. leveillei (no. 5a) and from Phoma
terricola Boerema (no. 10).#Misc-exposition*]

Africa (Ethiopia, Zambia, Zimbabwe). The primary indigenous host is probably Glycine
javanica. Varieties of soybean, Glycine max (originally native of eastern Asia), appear to
be very susceptible. The leaf spots, at first small, reddish brown, soon become necrotic and
may fall out, giving the plants a very ragged appearance. In susceptible varieties of soybean
leaf abscission is the most damaging aspect of the disease.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE GENUS AMANITA IN THE PAKARAIMA MOUNTAINS OF GUYANA#Misc-exposition*]

[@C. SIMMONS !, T. HENKEL? & C. BAS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Six species of Amanita (Amanitaceac, Basidiomycota, Fungi), collected in the Pakaraima
Mountains of Guyana, are described; four as new and two as new records for Guyana:
A. aurantiobrunnea spec. nov., A. calochroa spec. nov., A. cyanopus spec. nov., A. per-
phaea spec. nov., A. lanivolva Bas, and A. xerocybe Bas. All six species have been
collected in forests dominated by Dicymbe (Caesalpiniaceac) and are assumed to be
ectomycorthizal. Amanita perphaea is commonly eaten by Patamona Indians and is called
"Pulutukwe'.#Abstract*]

[@Ectomycorrhizal fungi, and specifically the genus Amanita, were long thought to be well
developed in the northern Temperate Zone, but poorly represented in the tropics (Gilbert,
194 1b). This viewpoint began to shift with the advent of mycofloristic studies in the paleo-
tropics, where numerous studies have demonstrated an increasingly wide diversity of ecto-
mycorrhizal fungi associated primarily with caesalpinioid legumes in Africa and with Dip-
terocarpaceae and Fagaceae in Asia (e.g. Heinemann, 1954; Corner & Bas, 1962; Corner,
1972; Watling & Lee, 1995; Buyck et al., 1996). In the lowland forests of the neotropics,
however, documentation of ectomycorrhizal associations is limited to the pioneering work
of Singer and colleagues in the Central Brazilian Azon and Central America, and Moyersoen
in southern Venezuela (Singer & Araujo, 1979; Singer et al., 1983, 1991; Moyersoen, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Knowledge of Amanita in South America is limited. Amanita species have been recorded
with the vegetation types of the pampas (but a small number of species recorded from the
pampas are probably non-ectomycorrhizal), open dry forests and, to a limited extent, lowland
rain forests (Bas, 1969). Dennis (1970) described only three species for Venezuela, among
which there was only one species (A. antilliana Dennis from Trinidad) from tropical lowland
forests. Subsequent description of new species from Amazonian Brazil by Bas (1978) and
Andean Colombia by Tulloss et al. (1992), among others, did much to reverse this trend of
thought, but the number of known Amanita species from the continent still remained rela-
tively low.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recent investigations of the macromycota of Guyana, in northeastern South America,
have revealed an extensive assemblage of putatively ectomycorrhizal fungi, including
Amanita, associated with trees of the legume genus Dicymbe Spruce ex Benth. in Benth.
Hookf. (Caesalpiniaceae, tribe Amherstieae) (Henkel, 1999; Henkel et al., 2000; Miller &
Henkel, 2000). These include, along with Amanita, members of the basidiomycete families
Boletaceae, Russulaceae, Cortinariaceae, Cantharellaceae, Clavariaceae, and Hygro-
phoraceae, as well as the hypogeous ascomycete genus Elaphomyces. These fungi are tightly#Misc-exposition*]

[@spatially associated with forest stands dominated by ectomycorrhizal Dicymbe species, in
particular D. corymbosa Spruce ex Benth. and D. altsonii Sandwith, which occur in a land-
scape-scale mosaic interposed with largely anectotrophic mixed forest in the Pakaraima
Mountains of west-central Guyana (Fanshawe 1952, 1955; Steege et al., 1993; Henkel, 2000).
Discovery of these Dicymbe-dominated ectotrophic forests in Guyana has greatly extended
the known range of ectomycorrhizal associations in South American rain forests.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terry Henkel, during the period 1993 to 1998, made 5 collecting expeditions to the Upper
Ireng River basin along the western border of Guyana with Brazil. He kindly allowed his
Guyanese Amanita collections be examined and analysed by the first author, under guidance
of the third author. As a preliminary result, four new species and two species previously
described from the Brazilian Amazon are recorded and described in the present paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Amanita consists largely of terrestrial, forest-inhabiting fungi with a rich bio-
geographic history (Bas, 1969). There are over 600 species known world-wide, with the
genus divided into two subgenera based on the amyloidity of the spores and the structure
of the margin of the pileus, viz. the subgenera Lepidella and Amanita, and the macroscopic
and microscopic features of the volva being a primary character for dividing the subgenus
Lepidella into four sections and the subgenus Amanita into two sections (Bas, 1969).#Misc-exposition*]

[@COLLECTING SITE DESCRIPTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The research site was located along the Upper Ireng River which forms the border
between Guyana! and Brazil in the South Central Pakaraima Mountains (general area: 5? 5
N; 59*58'W). This region of western Guyana constitutes the eastern extension of the Gua-
yana! Highlands, a distinct phytogeographic province characterized by sedimentary strata
overlying the igneous Guiana! Shield basement, oligotrophic soils, and a highly autoch-
thonous, endemicized flora (Gansser, 1954; Maguire, 1970; Gibbs & Barron, 1993). Eleva-
tions range from 700 m at riverside to 1800 m along the highest ridgelines. The resulting
terrain is of high relief and characterized by deeply cut creek and river valleys amidst highly
eroded plateaus and pinnacled ridgelines.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Annual rainfall for the remote area can only be inferred from records spanning the years
1935-1947 at a Potaro River site located approximately 100 km to the northeast, at the
eastern edge of the Pakaraima escarpment (Fanshawe, 1952). The annual mean for the 12
year period was 3866 mm with a pronounced peak in May and June, a lesser peak in
December and January, with relatively drier periods between. Since 1991, the timing of
annual wet and drier periods at the Ireng site have, in general, coincided with those indicated
by the Potaro data (Henkel, pers. obs.). At the Ireng site, during the onset of the rainy season
in May -June 1998, a total precipitation of 585 mm was recorded for a 27 day period, and
during May -June 1999 490 mm for a 30 day period, which were in accordance with the
mean values of 500—600 mm/month for May and June at the Potaro site. For macromycetes,
annual peak production of sporocarps appears to occur during the May —June period (Henkel,
unpubl.). Regional temperature records were unavailable, but during the equivalent periods
of 1998 and 1999 temperatures were remarkably constant at the Ireng site (daily max.: 25—
29°C; min.: 19-21°C). In general, these data correspond to a classification of Submeso-#Misc-exposition*]

[@thermic Ombrophilous Climate as indicated by Berry et al. (1995), defined as annual precipi-

falls below 100 mm), with average annual air temperatures ranging between 18°C and 24°C.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Vegetation of the region corresponds to the Dry Evergreen Forest Formation of the Paka-
raima Montane Region (Fanshawe, 1952). Fanshawe considered this formation to predom-
inate throughout the entire sandstone belt composing the Pakaraima Mountains, being sub-
divided into various associations and faciations with attendant dominant tree species
according to degree of soil drainage, the series running from sclerophyllous savanna on
the most poorly drained sites to well-drained, high canopy mixed forest, and ‘clump wallaba’
forest dominated by species of Dicymbe. Dicymbe, in particular D. corymbosa, forms exten-
sive mono-specifically dominant stands of five ha and larger on the lower toe slopes of the
mountains (Myers, 1936; Fanshawe, 1955; Richards, 1996). These Dicymbe stands have,
by tropical standards, extremely low woody plant diversity, with roughly 40 species >10
cm dbh per ha, with 80-95% of the basal area of the stand composed of D. corymbosa
(Henkel, 2000). Mixed forests of the area, generally lacking in Dicymbe, have 70-90 woody
species per ha, well represented by species of Eschweilera Mart. ex DC. (Lecythidaceae),
Ocotea Aubl. (Lauraceae), /nga Mill. (Mimosaceae), and Eperua Aubl. (Caesalpiniaceae)
(Henkel, unpubl.). Low-lying forests with poor drainage are generally dominated by Micran-
dra glabra (R.E. Schult.) R.E. Schult. (Euphorbiaceae) and Mora excelsa Benth. (Caesal-
piniaceae).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Soils are poor due to the sandstone nature of the parent materials. Soil impoverishment
is further evidenced by the universal presence of tannin-rich ‘blackwater’ streams throughout
the region (Janzen, 1974).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fungi were collected from an area of approximately 10 km? surrounding a series of
previously established base camps (Henkel, 1999). Basidiomata were examined in the field
for fresh characteristics. Colour characteristics were coded according to Kornerup &
Wanscher (1981) and described subjectively. Spore deposits, when obtained, were examined
for fresh colour characteristics. Basidiomata were dried slowly over charcoal and sub-
sequently placed in containers with silica gel to prevent spoilage in the excessively humid
conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All anatomical studies were performed on dried specimens. Microscopic examination
of tissues were done in 5% and 10% NH4OH or in 5% KOH. Stains used were Congo red
and the spores were observed in Melzer’s reagent and measured in 10% NH4OH and 5%
KOH. Bas found that in cases where amyloidity was dubious, soaking overnight in Melzer's
reagent and observing in fresh reagent the next morning made amyloidity show more clearly.
For spores at least 10 individuals per sample were measured and for basidia at least 6 indi-
viduals. Anatomical details were determined with an Olympus CHA microscope containing
bright field and phase contrast optics and line drawings were made with the help of a drawing
tube.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of rather primitive circumstances in the field, the dried specimens were often
not in optimal condition. It turned out that even in good looking specimens it sometimes
was very difficult or impossible to get the tissues of the trama of the lamellae, the stipe,
and the pileus to reinflate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@At first it was thought that the collections described above represented Amanita phaea
Bas nom. prov. (1978) from Brazilian Amazonia, described provisionally because the
material available does not have spores. But the pileipellis of A. phaea and A. perphaea
differs considerably. In A. phaea the superficial rather dark hyphae only have intracellular
pigment, whereas in A. perphaea there is an additional encrusting brown pigment. Moreover
there are elongate up to 24 µm wide inflated elements, probably all terminal, in the pileipellis
of A. perphaea, which are lacking in A. phaea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopically the two taxa differ as well. In A. perphaea the volval warts and patches
on the pileus are as dark as the pileipellis and have a pallid apex or centre, whereas in
A. phaea they are uniformly pallid. The aspect of the pileipellis differs also, viz. in A. per-
phaea dark and fibrillose with fibers strongly appressed to a paler background and in
A. phaea more uniformly greyish brown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In section Validae, where A. perphaea clearly belongs, several dark grey-brown species
with small spores have been described from different parts of the world.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita fritillaria f. malayensis Corner & Bas (1962) resembles A. perphaea rather
strongly, but has more and smaller volval warts on the pileus, a grey annulus at about the
half-way point of the stipe and no elongated inflated elements and apparently no encrusting
pigment in the pileipellis. According to Comer & Bas (1962) Amanita fritillaria (Berk.)
Sacc. f. fritillaria has more ellipsoid spores (aver. Q = 1.3—1.35).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another dark species from south-eastern Asia is Amanita pilosella Corner & Bas (1962),
which has several characters in common with A. perphaea, but has considerably smaller
fruit-bodies, more powdery to subvillose volval remnants on the pileus and a grey annulus
with blackish edge. It should be mentioned here that A. pilosella has the same type of elon-
gate inflated elements in the pileipellis as does A. perphaea.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita tristis Corner & Bas (1962) from Singapore has smaller and more ellipsoid
spores (4.9-6.1(—7.0) x 4.3-4.6 µm, aver. Q — 1.3—1.35) and the volval warts on the pileus
and the base of the stipe are entirely pale greyish to whitish.#Misc-exposition*]

pileus with dark pyramidal warts and a stipe entirely decorated with brown powdery
granules.#Misc-exposition*]

section Lepidella (then called Aspidella). However, Bas (1969) demonstrated that it belongs
to section Validae and suggested a position near A. pilosella. It has a dark brown pileus with
very dark conical warts and a dark brown stipe with a dark grey-brown annulus. Its type
has small globose to subglobose spores (5.5—6.5 x 4.5-5.5 µm; pers. obs. C. Bas.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita morristi Peck (1910) from North America also has a very dark pileus, at least
when young. However, it has no conical volval warts but pallid volval patches on the initially
dark grey-brown to blackish brown pileus and, according to Tulloss (1991), larger, more
ellipsoid spores (7—9.5 x 5.5—7 µm, Q = 1.28-1.42).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita spissacea S. Imai (1933) from Japan also has crust-like volval patches, in this
case very dark grey-brown on a paler background and has brown powdery scales on the
Stipe. This species has globose to subglobose spores. Yang (1997) suggested that A. spissacea
is a synonym for A. fritillaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since so far pigments in the pileipellis of Amanita have always been recorded as a vacu-
olar, it is remarkable that the very dark superficial hyphae on the pileus of A. perphaea
have an additional encrusting pigment. This could mean that these hyphae represent a
fibrillose, strongly fragmented inner layer of the volva. Encrusting pigments in the volval
tissues of Amanita have been recorded before.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita xerocybe Bas, described in 1978 from Brazilian Amazonia, is recorded for the
second time and for the first time from outside Brazil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The specimens from Guyana usually have a somewhat smaller pileus and a relatively
longer marginal striation, whereas the granular-subfloccose volval remnants have a some-
what more reddish brown colour. However, all the other characters being in agreement with
the protologue of A. xerocybe, we do not hesitate to consider the material from Guyana
conspecific with that from Brazilian Amazonia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Amanita xerocybe is a very characteristic species that belongs to section Amanita because
of its non-amyloid spores, friable volva, and bulbous base of the stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

[@CHEMOTAXONOMICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS
IN THE GENUS OMPHALOTUS (OMPHALOTACEAE)#Misc-exposition*]

[@MARTIN KIRCHMAIR!, REINHOLD PÖDER!, CHRISTIAN G. HUBER? &
ORSON K. MILLER JR.?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Comparative thin-layer chromatography — for the first time applied to Omphalotus olivas-
cens var. olivascens, O. olivascens var. indigo, O. nidiformis, and to O. mexicanus —
revealed strikingly similar pigment patterns for all Omphalotus species except O. mexica-
nus. Atromentin, thelephoric acid and pulvinic acid derivates were found in dried material
and/or culture extracts of all species. Illudin S and illudin M were detected in O. mexi-
canus by high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ioni-
sation mass spectrometry. Data on morphological features of all described Omphalotus
and Lampteromyces species are listed, illustrated, and summarized in a key. New com-
binations in the genus Omphalotus are proposed for Lampteromyces japonicus and
L. mangensis.#Abstract*]

[@In classical fungal taxonomy morphological-anatomical characters are often used exclusive-
ly to classify specimens. Unfortunately, many fungi show only few ‘good’ morphological
characters. Therefore, if possible, additional methods should be applied to elucidate their
taxonomic relationships. Besides eco-physiological (e.g. host specificity) or molecular (e.g.
DNA sequences) characters the investigation of pigment patterns still helps to clarify discrete
taxonomic limits. Following Singer (1986) the order Boletales is mainly characterized by
the occurrence of “pigments of the variegatic acid type or derivates (or otherwise related
to pigments commonly found in boletes)". The detection of certain Boletales pigments in
members of the genera Omphalotus Fayod and Lampteromyces Sing. was one of the main
motives of Bresinsky & Besl (1979b) to include them into the Paxillaceae. Further investi-
gations (Kümmerer et al., 1985) focused on physiological characters of some species of
the afore mentioned genera revealed relevant differences to other members of the Paxil-
laceae: based on both the occurrence of sesquiterpenes of the illudane type and the formation
of so called ‘white soft-rot’, features not found in other members of the Paxillaceae, the
new family Omphalotaceae Bresinsky was established. Until recently most chemotaxonom-
ical studies in the genus Omphalotus were focused on two species only: O. olearius and
O. illudens. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to gather additional chemo-
taxonomical and morphological data aiming at an improvement of the taxonomic structure
of the genus which is still unclear and incomplete.#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic descriptions were made from sections or pieces of tissue taken from dried
basidiomata, mounted in 2.5% KOH (pigment topology was studied in aqua dest. because
most of the pigments are soluble in KOH). A Nikon Labophot microscope with an automatic
photographic system (Sony Multiscan Video Printer UP-930) was used for light microscopy
(LM). Drawings of anatomical features are based on video prints. Video prints of spores
taken from a spore print or from the stipe were used for measurements also (sample size
for each collection > 30). Measurements are given in the form (minimum) mean + standard
deviation (maximum). Colour notations are mainly based on original descriptions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For thin layer chromatography (TLC) the different strains were cultivated on MEA plates
(malt extract agar, Merck 5398) for 20 days at 20°C and two hours light per day. The cultures
(cach with 20 ml medium) were liquefied at about 90°C and extracted with hot ethanol
acidified with a few drops of IN HCI. This raw extract was shaken out three times in a sep-
arating funnel with an equal amount of pure ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was dried
with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtrated and evaporated to dryness at 50°C. The residue
was resolved in 1.5 ml ethyl acetate. Twenty ul of these extracts were spotted on silica gel
TLC-plates (Merck 1.05721) with toluene : ethyl formate : formic acid (10: 5 : 3) asa sol-
vent according to Bresinsky (1974). If bands were too weak for characterization, the amount
of spotted extracts was increased to 30 or 40 yl. For separating thelephoric acid, methyl
ethyl ketone : H2O : formic acid (250 : 25 ; 1) was used as solvent. Pigment patterns were
examined in daylight and under UV (366 nm). For determining pulvinic acid derivates a
K3[Fe(CN);]/NaHCO ; solution was used as spray reagent: variegatic acid and xerocomic
acid change their colour from yellow to blue. Incubating the chromatogram in ammonium
vapour for half an hour changes the colour of these two pigments to red. Atromentinic acid
shows no colour change with K3[Fe(CN)5]/NaHCO ; but turns violet with ammonium
(Bresinsky, 1974). Thelephoric acid was identified following Bresinsky & Rennschmied
(1971). For reference the following compounds were used: xerocomic acid and variegatic
acid isolated from Boletinus cavipes, thelephoric acid from Thelephora terrestris, atromentin
from Paxillus atrotomentosus, and atromentinic acid provided by Dr. H. Besl (Regensburg,
Germany). Isolation procedures were carried out following Kógl & Postowsky (1924),
Bresinsky & Orendi (1970), and Bresinsky & Rennschmied (1971).#Misc-exposition*]

[@For detection and identification of illudin S and illudin M by high-performance liquid
chromatography — atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation — mass spectrometry (HPLC-
APCI-MS) liquid cultures of O. mexicanus were used according to Kirchmair et al. (1999).
Illudin S and illudin M standards were kindly provided by Trevor C. McMorris, San Diego,
USA. The HPLC system consisted of a low-pressure gradient micro pump (model Rheos
2000, Flux Instruments, Karlskoga, Sweden) controlled by a personal computer, a vacuum
degasser (Knauer, Berlin, Germany), and an injector (model Cheminert C3-2006, Valco
Instruments Co. INC., Houston, TX, USA) with a 5 ul sample loop. LC separations were
performed with a gradient of 10-42% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous acetic acid in 20 min at
a flow-rate of 250 ul/min. The Nucleosil ODS (3 µm, 100 À) column packing material
was obtained from Macherey & Nagel (Düren, Germany) and packed into a 150 « 2 mm
i.d. stainless steel column (Grom, Herrenberg, Germany) with the help of an air-driven
high-pressure packing pump (Knauer, Berlin, Germany).#Misc-exposition*]

[@APCI-MS3 was performed on a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer

[@ionisation ion source. For LC-MS analysis with heat assisted pneumatic nebulisation, a
corona current of 5 JA at 5 kV and a sheath gas flow of 60 arbitrary units were employed.
The temperatures of the heated nebuliser and the heated pileusillary were set at 450 and
200°C, respectively. Highly selective MS? mass spectra for illudin S and illudin M were
obtained using the transitions 247.1—217.1— full scan from 60-250 u and 231.1
213.2 full scan from 60-250 u, respectively, with a relative collision energy of 15%. Total

[@By many mycologists O. illudens is seen as conspecific with O. olearius (c.g. Watling
& Gregory, 1989). A greenish staining of the pileipellis when treated with 25% ammonia
solution or 30% KOH could be observed in all examined species of Omphalotus, a reaction
easily recognisable when small fragments are squeezed between two glass slides. In contrast
to other reports (e.g. Kuyper, 1995) refracting hyphae were found in the pileipellis of all
Omphalotus species but they are rather scarce in most O. olearius collections. Thus, the
only distinct morphological differences between O. olearius and O. illudens are the form
and colour of the basidiomata: umbonate and uniformly yellowish orange coloured basidio-
mata are characteristic for O. illudens. A papilla like umbo was never observed in ©. olearius;
its pileus was always darker (usually reddish brown) than lamellae and stipe.#Misc-exposition*]

1947). Singer (1986) delimited this genus from Omphalotus by its voluminous spores (up
to 17 µm in diameter) and the presence of a veil. Chemical characters such as the occurrence
of Boletales pigments and of sesquiterpenes of the illudane type are very similar in L. japo-
nicus and in Omphalotus species (Kammerer et al. 1985). Until now two further species in
the genus Lampteromyces have been described: L. luminescens M. Zang and L. mangensis
J. Li & X. Hu.#Diagnosis*]

[@Lampteromyces luminescens is described to have no veil, punctate spores, fusiform
cheilocystidia, serrate gill edges and, compared to the other two species, a relative slender
stipe (Zang, 1979). For more characters see Table III and Figs. 31— 34. Microchemical reac-
tions (e.g. amyloidity of spores) are not mentioned in the original description. Although no
material was available for our studies it seems likely that Lampteromyces luminescens
belongs to Lentinellus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pigments from dried material#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the exception of O. mexicanus a very similar pigment pattern could be observed
for all species (Fig. 35, Table IV). All species were characterized by the presence of atromen-
tin and thelephoric acid although these pigments were produced in quite different quantities:
In the two varieties of O. olivascens very large amounts of atromentin could be detected
whereas in O. olearius and O. nidiformis only traces of this pigment were found. Medium
quantities of atromentin were produced by O. illudens, O. mexicanus, and O. subilludens.
Thelephoric acid was abundant in all species except in O. olearius and O. subilludens where
only small amounts were detectable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pigments from cultures#Misc-exposition*]

[@A survey of the known Boletales pigments in Omphalotus and Lampteromyces is given
in Table IV. Atromentin and thelephoric acid were found in all culture extracts. Variegatic
acid, although not detectable in dried material, was present in Lampteromyces japonicus
and all Omphalotus strains. The red pigment variegatorubin, found in all culture extracts,
might be an artefact caused by oxidation during extraction (Gill & Steglich, 1987). The
presence of xerocomic acid could be shown in cultures of O. illudens, O. mexicanus and
the two varieties of O. olivascens. The cyclopentanoid 'gyroporin' and the pulvinic acid
derivate ‘atromentinic acid’, which had been found by Bresinsky & Besl (1979b) in O. illu-
dens, O. olearius and L. japonicus were not clearly detectable in this study. Moreover, a#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dried material is useful for morphological research but many characteristic pigments
are rapidly degraded. Therefore, herbarium specimens may be useful for chemotaxonomical
fingerprints but not for the identification of group characteristic metabolites. For extensive
comparative chemotaxonomical studies fresh basidiomata are usually not available. Thus,
culture extracts provide a suitable alternative. But it should be mentioned that the pigment
pattern in native basidiomata need not be identical to that in mycelium cultures (Bresinsky,
1974).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In all Omphalotus and Lampteromyces species typical Boletales pigments of the pulvinic
acid type as well as sesquiterpenes of the illudane type were found. As already discussed
by Kümmerer et al. (1985) the combination of these two features is highly characteristic
for Omphalotus and Lampteromyces and cannot be found in any other mushroom group.
Because of the uniqueness of the metabolites illudin S and illudin M Nair et al. (1983) pro-
posed the placement of Lampteromyces in Omphalotus. Kammerer et al. (1985) stressed
that in contrast to the more irregular hymenophoral trama in Lampteromyces, Omphalotus
has a distinctly divergent gill anatomy. In the present study a distinctly divergent tramal
structure could not be observed in Omphalotus (see also Singer, 1986). Thus, the large spores
and the occurrence of a veil in Lampteromyces remain as reliable distinguishing characters.
In other genera, e.g. in Armillaria or in Pleurotus, species with and without veil have been
described. Moreover, sequence analyses of the ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region demon-
strated that L. japonicus clustered within the clade of Omphalotus and was not assigned to
a separate clade (Stolz, 1999). So it seems logical to regard Lampteromyces as a synonym
of Omphalotus. The following new combinations are necessary:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lampteromyces luminescens M. Zang differs in macro- and microscopical characters
from Omphalotus species. Luminosity of the basidiomata is the only character it shares
with Omphalotus species. Its rough spores, fusiform cheilocystidia and the serrate gill edges
make an affiliation to Lentinellus probable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In literature, the delimitation of the different Omphalotus species is controversial.
Omphalotus mexicanus and O. nidiformis, for example, can be accepted as good morpho-
species on account of their unique characters (Table II): the entire basidioma of the former
is bluish black, and terminal cells covered with violet crystal needles can be found in its
hymenophoral trama. White lamellae and a white context are typical for O. nidiformis
(Miller, 1994), features it shares with O. japonicus and O. mangensis. However, the latter
two species are characterized by an annular zone at the stipe apex and much bigger spores.
The opinion that O. mexicanus and O. nidiformis are separate species is supported by the#Misc-exposition*]
[@598 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 4, 2001#Page-header*]

[@findings of Petersen & Hughes (1998) who reported only a low sexual compatibility of
O. nidiformis with other Omphalotus species. The results of their RFLP analyses of the
ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region confirmed the relatively isolated position of these two
taxa (Hughes & Petersen, 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@There has long been disagreement whether or not the American O. illudens and the
European O. olearius are two different species. Mating experiments affirmed that O. illudens
ranks as species from North America (Petersen & Hughes, 1998). But it remains still unclear
if beside O. olearius also O. illudens exists in Europe since there are only few morphological
separating characters: the colour of O. illudens is paler (uniformly yellowish orange), the
pileus is umbonate and refractive hyphae are abundant in the pileipellis. Using these criteria
it seems that the collections from Belgium belong to O. illudens while all collections from
the mediterranean region can be recognised as O. olearius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Omphalotus subilludens is morphological very similar to O. olearius but differs in its
elliptic spores and numerous refractive hyphae in the pileipellis. Omphalotus olivascens is
distinguished from O. olearius mainly by its more olive colours (the context is blue in its
variety indigo), the abundant refractive hyphae, and significantly bigger spores. The olive
and blue colours are due to the very high amount of the pigment atromentin (Kirchmair &
Griesser, 1999). Petersen & Hughes (1998) noticed a very high level of sexual intercompat-
ibility between collections of the three taxa mentioned before. Moreover, Hughes & Petersen
(1998) found no differences in the RFLP patterns between O. olearius and O. subilludens.
Omphalotus olivascens differed in one restriction site from the two former taxa. The findings
of these authors indicate that these three taxa belong to one biological species. Nevertheless,
since they are geographically well isolated and differ at least in two morphological charac-
ters, they can be considered as different morphospecies in agreement with a morphological
species concept (see Kuyper, 1988).#Misc-exposition*]

A new Rhizoctonia-like fungus isolated in Spain#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceratobasidium albasitensis is described as a new species based on morphological data
and on phylogenetic reconstruction from rDNA sequences, including representatives of
other related species. Isolates of this species were found in several localities within Albac-
ete province (SE of Spain). This taxon is part of the Rhizoctonia s.|. species complex
and is placed in the genus Ceratobasidium (Stat. Anam. = Ceratorhiza) on account of
its macro- and micromorphological features. In addition, two new methods to induce
sexual sporulation on plates are described.#Abstract*]

[@The form-genus Rhizoctonia is currently considered to be a heterogeneous assemblage of
fungal taxa, which do not form asexual spores, but have certain significant morphological
characteristics in common. The Rhizoctonia complex is now split into at least seven or eight
genera, according to different authors (Moore, 1987; Andersen, 1996). Rhizoctonia s.. has
considerable ecological and economic importance because it occurs worldwide and different
isolates within the complex may live as saprotrophs or as symbionts (such as those associated
with terrestrial orchids). Many isolates are also effective in protecting plants from a number
of fungal diseases (Sneh, 1998), promoting plant growth. Conversely, many other isolates
cause significant losses in agriculture and forestry; currently Rhizoctonia diseases have been
described in more than 200 plant species. At least 120 epithets referring to Rhizoctonia can
be found in the literature, where until recently very few attempts to clarify genera and species
concepts had been made (Sneh et al., 1991; Andersen & Stalpers, 1994; Roberts, 1999).
Teleomorphs of fungi that show the morphological characteristics of Rhizoctonia species
with binucleate hyphal compartments have usually been reported as belonging to Cerato-
basidium D.P. Rogers, with the exception of Epulorhiza repens (N. Bernard) Moore (=
Rhizoctonia repens Bernard), which has been found by some authors to have a perfect state
in Tulasnella Schroet. (T. deliquescens (Juel) Juel = T. calospora (Boud.) Juel s. auct.) (Sneh
et al., 1991). Ceratobasidium is regarded as close to Thanatephorus Donk, being considered
by some authors (e.g. Stalpers & Andersen, 1996; Roberts, 1999) as part of a generic
complex, where delimitation presents some difficulties. Anamorphic Rhizoctonia-like fungi
from these two genera have traditionally been classified on the basis of the number of nuclei
per hyphal compartment, considering Thanatephorus as multinucleate and Ceratobasidium
as binucleate, althought the nuclear condition remains unknown for many taxa. Another
important handicap to understanding the taxonomy of these fungi is the fact that most studies
on Rhizoctonia s.l. are performed with cultures where sexual reproductive structures are#Misc-exposition*]

[@usually not or hardly observed, so that delimitation of species is based on the morphology
and physiological features of the asexual morphs. Because of this, the development of new
methods for inducing teleomorph formation constitutes a valuable tool to clarifying and
correlating Rhizoctonia taxonomy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some non-pathogenic or hypovirulent isolates within the form-genus Rhizoctonia have
been shown to be highly effective biocontrol agents (Sneh, 1998). In the majority of studies
to date, most of the known isolates capable of protecting plants and preventing diseases
have been found to belong to Ceratobasidium. In preliminary studies (data not shown),
isolates of the new species described here have proved to possess protective properties in
several plant species against pathogenic isolates of Rhizoctonia solani Kiihner (= Thana-
tephorus cucumeris (A.B, Frank) Donk), and other fungal pathogens such as Fusarium
spp., Alternaria spp., Penicillium spp.. etc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As stated by some authors (e.g. Mordue et al., 1989; Andersen, 1996), the employment
of integrated approaches to solve taxonomic problems in Rhizoctonia (including mor-
phometrical, cultural, biochemioal, ecological and molecular data) could lead to establishing
more accurate and natural classifications within this group of organisms. In the present work,
molecular phylogeny of binucleate Rhizoctonia isolates was undertaken based on sequence
data from the ribosomal ITS region. The isolates included those from Albacete, several
testers used for defining anastomosis groups within binucleate Rhizoctonia, and miscella-
neous sequences of Ceratobasidium retrieved from GenBank, The results provided addi-
tional evidence (at sequence level) for validating the new taxon presently described.#Misc-exposition*]

[@METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceratobasidium albasitensis isolates#Misc-exposition*]

[@Root samples of saffron corms and pine seedlings were collected from six locations in
Albacete. Ceratobasidium isolates were collected by washing roots with tap water to remove
adhering soil particles and placing both root segments and rhizobial soil particles on 1.5%
water agar amended with chloramphenicol (250 mg/ml). Some of the resulting colonies
were identified as belonging to Ceratorhiza s. Moore (1987) (= binucleate Rhizoctonia) by
observing typical morphological features such as hyphal branching, number of nuclei, colour
of the cultures, sclerotia formation or dolipore septa. Cultures were then transferred and
maintained on potato-dextrose-agar (PDA) at room temperature. The number of nuclei per
cell was determined using a staining method as described by Julián et al. (1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Formation of perfect state#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two undescribed methods were used to induce formation of basidiocarps by the isolates.
The first method consisted of a modification of the one described by Hietala et al. (1994).
In this first procedure, sterile radish seedlings (ethanol 70% 2°; sodium hypochloride 5%
with Tween 0.005% 15° and at least five washes in distilled water), were pregerminated by
incubating them on 15% water-agar plates at 24°C in the dark. After two days, the seedlings
were transferred to Petri-dishes containing 20 ml sterile water with two 5 x 5 mm blocks of
a7 days old colony of the fungus, and incubated at room temperature with natural lighting.
Teleomorph production started between 3 and 10 days after fungal inoculation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second new method was developed in our laboratory, consisting of a modification of
some of the previously described methods (i.e. Flentje, 1956; Murray, 1982, 1984) based#Misc-exposition*]
[@González et al.: Ceratobasidium albasitensis, spec. nov. 603#Page-header*]

[@on transferring isolates from high nutrient agar to low nutrient agar. Briefly, basidiomes
were obtained by growing cultures of the isolates on PDA (potato-dextrose-agar) for 5-6
days and then transferred to plates of 15% water-agar containing small pieces (two blocks
of 10 cm? aprox. per plate) of leaves or twigs from several plant species such as Nerium
oleander L.. Prunus laurocerasus L., Ligustrum vulgare L., Pinus halepensis Miller, etc.,
previously surface sterilized as described above. Hymenial production started (depending
upon the strains) between 7 and 15 days after the transfer of the colonies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic reconstruction#Misc-exposition*]

[@For phylogenetic analysis, the entire sequence of the ITS regions of 37 binucleate
Rhizoctonia isolates, representing several Ceratobasidium teleomorphs, was determined.
The sequences were aligned and processed for phylogenetic reconstruction. All the isolates
used in this work are listed in Table I, including the isolates of C. albasitensis, all available
AG testers of binucleate Rhizoctonia described up to date and some C. cornigerum and
C. cerealis isolates from the CBS collection (Baarn, The Netherlands). In addition, several
ITS sequences including C. oryzae-sativae, C. cerealis, Waitea circinata and Serendipita
vermifera s. Roberts (1999) (= Sebacina vermifera) were retrieved from GenBank. DNA
isolation, PCR and DNA sequencing procedures used have been previously described
(Boysen et al., 1996). Alignments of the ITS regions were performed using the multiple
alignment program CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994), Phylogenetic analysis of the
aligned sequences was performed using maximum-parsimony with the heuristic-search algo-
rithm of the Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (PAUP) program 3.1.1 (Swofford,
1993) with gaps treated as missing data. The trees were rooted with Agaricus bisporus as
an outgroup. The data were resampled with 1000 bootstrap replicates (Felsenstein, 1985)
by using the heuristic search option of PAUP. The percentage of bootstrap replicates that
yielded each grouping was used as a measure of statistical confidence. A grouping found in
90% of bootstrap replicates was considered statistically significant. Similar trees were also
obtained from the distance matrix of Jukes and Cantor using the neighbour-joining method
of the program PHYLIP 3.5 (Felsenstein, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A system of anastomosis grouping based on hyphal fusion is widely accepted as the basis
for recognizing groups among the several taxa that constitute the form-genus Rhizoctonia
(Ogoshi, 1975; Sneh et al. 1991). These methods have been extensively employed for both
multinucleate and binucleate Rhizoctonia isolates, instead of taxonomical approaches deal-
ing with teleomorph-based systems. Several authors have pointed out the difficulty in differ-
entiating species within Ceratobasidium (Ogoshi et al., 1983). Although there are some
reports in the literature of well-defined taxa based on the morphology of the teleomorphic
phase [i.e. C. oryzae-sativae Gunnell & R.K. Webster (1987); C. ramicola Tu, Roberts &
Kimbrough (1969)], many of the teleomorphs from the different anastomosis groups
recognized within “binucleate Rhizoctonia’ (AG-E, AG-L, AG-l, AG-K, etc) obtained in
the laboratory by indirect methods, although assigned to Ceratobasidium, are generally
not defined at species level (Sneh et al., 1991).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thanatephorus, the teleomorphic stage of multinucleate Rhizoctonia (e.g. R. solani) is
the closest genus to Ceratobasidium. The systematic position of both genera within the
Basidiomycetes has been previously studied (Talbot, 1965; Eriksson & Ryvarden, 1973;
Stalpers & Andersen, 1996; etc.) and the relationships of the Ceratobasidiaceae with the
Heterobasidiomycetes (mainly Tulasnellaceae and Tremellaceae) profusely discussed. The
systematic arrangement still remains unclear, although they are presently placed among
the Ceratobasidiaceae (Ceratobasidiales, Basidiomycetes) within the Homobasidiomycetes
(Hawksworth et al., 1995). Recently, Roberts (1999) suggested a rearrangement of the classi-
fication proposed in Hawksworth et al. (1995). He proposed simplifying the current nomen-
clatural status of genera within the Ceratobasidiaceae by recognizing just three genera with-
in the family: Ceratobasidium, Thanatephorus and Waitea. As stated by several authors
(e.g. Stalpers & Andersen, 1996; Roberts, 1999), the differences used to distinguish these
genera are gradual, although it is commonly accepted that Thanatephorus is applied to those#Misc-exposition*]

ing more than two nuclei per compartment), while the name Ceratobasidium is applied to
taxa with ceraceous fruitbodies with ovoid to sphaeropedunculate basidia arising in raceme-
like groups from the subicular hyphae (generally with two nuclei per compartment). The
convenience of accepting genus Waitea as a member of the Ceratobasidiaceae will be
discussed below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The sizes of the ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2) of the different isolates are listed in
Table 1. The ITS1 region varied in length from 171 to 228 bp, the ITS2 region varied from
198 to 249 bp. It was regularly observed that the ITS1 region was slightly shorter than the
ITS2 for all the isolates used in the study. The 5.8S region was highly conserved: all the
isolates analyzed were 155 bp in length, only minor variations in nucleotide sequence were
detected among isolates and this variation was identical in isolates belonging to the same
species. The percentage of similarity in the total ITS region among the main clusters recog-
nized in the phylogenetic tree (labelled from GI to G9) is summarized in Table II.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic trees based on ITS sequences were obtained with PAUP. PHYLIP analysis
did not differ in the topology of the strongly supported branches. The parsimony analysis
of these characters generated 100 equally parsimonious trees with the minimum length tree
of 1008 steps. with consistency (CI) and retention (RI) indexes of 0.6577 and 0.8214 respec-
tively. One of these most parsimonious trees is shown in Fig. 2. Parsimony analysis of the
ITS region supports in general the morpho- and cytological criteria used for defining and
delimitating species within Ceratobasidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the exception of Ceratobasidium cornigerum (AG-Bo and AG-P), C. cerealis (AG-
D) and C. oryzae-sativae (AG-Bb), when more than one isolate of the same species was
sequenced, they always clustered together in the same branch, or at least in adjacent
branches.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phylogenetic analysis grouped all the binucleate taxa with a Ceratobasidium teleomorph
in seven groups, most of them well supported by bootstrap indexes. These binucleate groups
clustered apart from the isolates of Waitea circinata and Serendipita vermifera. Several
authors have discussed the position of these last two taxa, usually considered within the
concept of Rhizoctonia s.|. according to the morphological features exhibited by their ana-
morphic states. Moore (1978, 1987), employing electron microscopy to characterize the
ultrastructure of the septal pore apparatus, designated those binucleate Rhizoctonia ana-
morphs with a perfect state in the genus Tulasnella as belonging to Epulorhiza, while
Andersen and Moore (Moore, 1996) erected the ephitet Opadorhiza to accommodate
Rhizoctonia globularis Saksena & Vaartaja, a taxon with a teleomorph in Sebacina s.l.,
very similar to Epulorhiza but with a different septal pore apparatus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the basis of these studies, both genera must be considered as peripheral to Rhizoctonia
in the modern concept of the complex. Nevertheless, Roberts (1999) included Waitea as a
member of the Ceratobasidiaceae, considering the genus as very close to (if not synonymous
with) Thanatephorus based on morphological criteria. Phylogenetic reconstruction carried
out in the present study is not in concordance with this hypothesis, and suggests moving
Waitea out of the Ceratobasidiaceae. Furthermore Johanson ct al. (1998), in a study
employing a PCR-based method to discriminate between the different taxa involved in the
rice sheath-blight disease complex, showed that isolates from Rhizoctonia oryzae (teleo-
morph = Waitea circinata) clustered apart from those of R. solani and R. oryzae-sativae#Misc-exposition*]

[@(teleomorph = Ceratobasidium oryzae-sativae). The systematic position of Serendipita
vermifera, as revealed by molecular phylogeny, agrees with the conclusions previously
reported by some authors (e.g. Roberts, 1999; Andersen, 1996; etc). The first author
segregated some taxa from the genus Sebacina Tul. (Tremellales s. Hawksworth et al., 1995)
into at least four genera: Ceratosebacina P. Roberts, Endoperplexa P. Roberts, Serendipita
P. Roberts and Hauerslevia P. Roberts, all of them included by the author in the Exidiales.
In addition, Andersen (1996) employed both ultrastructural and molecular methods
(including RFLP analysis) to distinguish Waitea and Sebacina s.l. from other forms within
Rhizoctonia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Group 7 includes several AG testers of binucleate Rhizoctonia such as AG-Bo, AG-Bb,
AG-P, AG-N and AG-K, one binucleate isolate from Spain previously identified as
Ceratobasidium sp., together with the isolates 521 and 2815, and two Rhizoctonia isolates
previously reported in the literature as R. solani AG-4 (Boysen et al. 1996). This cluster
separates from the rest of the binucleate isolates (100% bootstrap value), forming a hetero-
geneous assemblage of taxa, including two strains of C. cornigerum, one of C. oryzae-
sativae, and several AG tester isolates with insufficient or completely unknown sexual
morphs. In spite of the nomenclatural heterogenity, nucleotide divergence within this branch
ranges from 0.35 to 4.37%, suggesting that the taxonomic status of some of these AG testers
must be revised.#Misc-exposition*]
[@610 PERSOONIA — Vol. 17, Part 4, 2001#Page-header*]

[@Group 6 includes three AG tester isolates (AG-I, AG-G and AG-J), all of them without
any well-defined teleomorph. Recently, Masuhara et al. (1994) reported the teleomorphic
features of some isolates of AG-I, and characterized them as probably belonging to the
species complex Ceratobasidium cornigerum, although these authors reported two sexual
morphs, C. cornigerum and C. pseudocornigerum, for several isolates. The other two strains,
AG-G and AG-J are reported in the literature (Sneh et al., 1991) as belonging to Cerato-
basidium, without defining any specific epithet.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Group 5 brings together all the strains determined as belonging to the new species
proposed here (with a 98% bootstrap value). Isolates from this branch ranged between 0.00
and 1.06% in nucleotide divergence (the lowest values found in any of the 9 clades), sug-
gesting that strains from clade 5, although isolated from different localities (and even from
different hosts) could represent a well-defined and homogeneous taxon within Cerato-
basidium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Groups 4 and 3 branch together (supported by a 76% bootstrap value) and contain several
Ceratobasidium cerealis isolates (Group 4) and a set of C. oryzae-sativae strains (Group
3) with one binucleate AG tester (AG-S) referred to in the literature as Ceratobasidium sp.
Group 4 included sequences obtained from CBS isolates, together with one sequence
obtained from the GenBank, and all of them showed a nucleotide divergence ranging from
0.34 to 1.53%, which suggests a very low intraspecific variation for this taxon. In addition,
the other isolate (AG-D) with a sexual morph defined as C. cerealis, clustered in Group 1,
together with several C. cornigerum AG testers. Ceratobasidium gramineum (= C. cerealis;
Corticium gramineum) was proposed (Oniki et al., 1986) as the teleomorphic state for AG-
D (CAG-1) strains. These authors obtained some sexual fructifications from AG-D strains
and compared morphological measures of their hymenial components with those of Corti-
cium gramineum Ikata & T. Matsuura and Ceratobasidium cereale Murray & Burpee,
concluding that these three taxa must be considered conspecific. After critical revision of
the dimensions reported for Corticium gramineum and C. cerealis in Oniki et al. (1986),
these last two taxa could not be considered as synonyms. Thus, teleomorphs exhibited by
AG-D strains can be assigned to the taxa described by Murray & Burpee (1984), but not to
Corticium gramineum. On the other hand, dimensions reported for C. cereale by these last
authors fit into the range of measures given by Rogers (1935) for C. cornigerum. Further-
more, a recent study ( Toda et al., 1999) on several AG-D isolates from turfgrass, differentiate
two subgroups (I and II) within the AG by means of rDNA and RAPD analyses. In summary,
molecular and morphological data suggest the existence of two teleomorphic forms for this
AG; one of them probably closely related to other AG groups (i.e. AG-C, AG-A, etc) with a
C. cornigerum teleomorph, and other groups defined by possessing a C. cerealis teleomorph.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Group 3 includes four sequences of C. oryzae-sativae retrieved from GenBank and one
AG-S tester isolate. The original host of this last strain is not mentioned in the literature
and, although no teleomorphic state has been defined up to date for this tester, it could also
represent a member of this taxon. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that this well-known
rice pathogen could constitute a natural taxon, in spite of the nucleotide divergence observed
for the group (ranging from 0.16 to 8.46%) and the heterogeneous geographical origin of
the samples analyzed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Group 2 includes some strains from the CBS culture collection (with a 100% bootstrap
value), all of them deposited under the name of Ceratobasidium cornigerum, plus one isolate
from Albacete (Spain), previously identified (using teleomorph induction methods) as#Misc-exposition*]
[@González et al.: Ceratobasidium albasitensis, spec. nov. 611#Page-header*]

[@C. cornigerum s.l. Within this clade, nucleotide divergence ranges from 3.15 to 13.88%,
indicating high rates of heterogenity at sequence level. Furthermore, the CBS strains were
deposited as representative isolates from several of the anastomosis groups defined for binu-
cleate Rhizoctonia in America (Burpee et al., 1980a; 1980b). These molecular data suggest
that American AGs represent a closely related pool of taxa where the different groups could
constitute populations of the same collective taxon with different rates of somatic isolation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Group 1 and Group 2 formed a common branch. Group 1 isolates are 5 Japanese AG
testers (AG-A, AG-C, AG-D, AG-E and AG-L) and one isolate from CAG2. With the excep-
tion of AG-D (discussed above), teleomorphs indicated in the literature from members of
this group are mostly Ceratobasidium cornigerum or unnamed Ceratobasidium spp. Several
authors (e.g. Ogoshi et al., 1983) have proposed correlating most of the American binucleate
AGs with the Japanese groups. The phylogenetic reconstruction carried out in this work
suggests considering the different AGs described for binucleate Rhizoctonia (both Ameri-
can and Japanese isolates) as members of the same collective taxon, where relationships
between the different groups of isolates (in terms of somatic compatibility) need to be revis-
ed, due to the fact that correlations based on hyphal anastomosis are not well reflected at
sequence level. Cubeta et al. (1991), employing molecular methodologies (RFLP analysis)
to characterize most of the AGs of binucleate Rhizoctonia species, were able to separate 13
of the 21 AGs defined for binucleate Rhizoctonia, although the relatedness and correlations
between the American and Japanese groups were not exactly consistent with those proposed
by Ogoshi et al. (1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@With respect to the nutritional behaviour of the taxa included in the study, molecular
data supports the differentiation of the several life styles within Ceratobasidium. Phylo-
genetic reconstruction suggests the existence of at least two monophyletic trends in the
genus. One of them is linked to pathogenicity, and includes Group 1 and Group 2, where
most of the isolates are reported in the literature as pathogenic to several plant species
(Burpee et al., 1980b; Ogoshi et al., 1983; Toda et al., 1999; etc.), plus Groups 3 and 4,
which include rice and grass pathogens. The other branches in the phylogenetic tree involve
mostly saprotrophic taxa (Group 5), as well as other isolates not previously reported as
pathogens (e.g. AG-I, AG-P. AG-N, etc.), or even described as plant protective isolates
(e.g. AG-G) (Leclerc-Potvin et al., 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In summary, phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region supported the definition of Cerato-
basidium albasitensis, an undescribed binucleate taxon well differentiated from other taxa
described in the genus by morphometrical methods (see discussion below). Furthermore,
phylogenetic reconstruction allowed the outlining of some hypotheses on the relationships
among the rest of the taxa within Ceratobasidium. Thus, C. cornigerum, the most common
and widespread taxon of the genus, has been revealed in our studies as a large complex of
taxa (including different species, varieties, ecotypes and populations), where a critical revi-
sion of the species concept, as well as a redefinition of the criteria for defining anastomosis
groups is still required.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On account of the presence of two nuclei per hyphal compartment, saprotrophic behav-
iour, presence of a Ceratorhiza anamorph and the micromorphological features exhibited
(including hymenial structure and basidial shape), we place the new species described in
the genus Ceratobasidium. Ceratobasidium albasitensis is characterized by its soil habitat,
large and sphaeropedunculate basidia, ovoid to subellipsoid spores and extremely large
sterigmata (up to 35.7 µm). and clearly differs from other described Ceratobasidium species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ceratobasidium stridii J. Erikss. & Ryvarden, a rare north temperate taxon characterized
by having small basidiospores of 5.5—7 x 3-4 µm, resembles C. albasitensis, but, based
on the literature available (Eriksson & Ryvarden, 1973; Roberts, 1999), spores of C. stridii
are oblong to fusiform (Q = 1.5-1.9). In addition, spores from C. stridii were reported to
produce secondary spores mostly apically, a feature not constantly present in the genus
and absent in the taxon presently described. The most common and ubiquitous taxon of the
genus, C. cornigerum (Bourd.) D.P. Rogers, seems to be a complex of several different
taxa, which some authors (e.g. Roberts, 1999) consider within a broad species concept.
Nevertheless, the last author has pointed out a possible splitting of the complex among
several of the existing synonyms on the basis of genetic distinctions. In this sense, DNA
sequencing in the present study suggests separating taxa such as C. cereale from C. corni-
gerum s. str. Concerning the new species proposed here, C. cornigerum differs from C.
albasitensis in having subceraceous basidiomes with smaller, laterally stalked cuboid to
papillate basidia and larger, ellipsiod to fusiform, sometimes subcylindrical (Q = 1.4—2.0)
spores up to 12.5 µm long and shorter sterigmata up to 12 µm long (Rogers, 1935; Eriksson
& Ryvarden, 1973; Jülich, 1989; Roberts, 1999). Ceratobasidium obscurum D.P. Rogers,
ataxon misreported as an orchid associate (Warcup & Talbot, 1967) and presently combined
as Thanatephorus obscurum (D. P. Rogers) P. Roberts (Roberts, 1998), has spores resembling
those of C. albasitensis, being subglobose to broadly ellipsoid with Q 2 1.2—1.4 (but not
overlapping in size range). This taxon must be definitively considered as a Thanatephorus
species as revealed by Roberts (1998) in a study of the type collection, where this author
reports oblong basidia forming hymenial palisades and a saprotrophic habitat on rotten wood
of Ulmus sp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@BOLBITIUS ELEGANS, A STRIKING NEW SPECIES FROM
SOUTHERN SPAIN#Misc-exposition*]

[@E. HORAK!, G. MORENO?, A. ORTEGA? & F. ESTEVE-RAVENTÖS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bolbitius elegans spec. nov., a new species with gasteroid habit, is described and
illustrated, Its taxonomic relationships with other taxa of Bolbitius and members of pre-
sumably related secotioid-gasteroid genera are discussed.#Abstract*]

[@While studying the Basidiomycota of several habitats in southern Spain (Andalucia, prov-
inces of Málaga, Huelva and Cádiz), the elegant basidiocarps of a bolbitiaceous agaric
attracted our attention by their Gastrocybe- or Galeropsis-like habit. The weakly deliques-
cent basidiocarps with brilliant golden-yellow pileus and pale yellow stipe have exclusively
been found on horse dung in open and grazed meadows on limestone.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present taxon has previously been recorded as Gastrocybe sp. in the checklist refer-
ring to the Basidiomycota in or near the endemic Abies pinsapo forests in Andalucia (Ortega
et al., 1996). On several later occasions, material in perfect condition was recollected which
subsequently allowed a thorough analysis of the taxonomically relevant macro- and micro-
scopic features of the ephemeral basidiocarps. Despite the fact that the basidiocarps are
mimicking taxa of gasteroid Bolbitiaceae, it turned out that all morphological characters
observed in the new taxon clearly indicate that this species belongs to the genus Bolbitius
Fr. and not, as earlier suspected, to any of the associated secotioid-gasteroid genera (Heim,
1950, 1968; Watling & Gregory, 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@SEM-photographs of the basidiospores, prepared by the critical point method, were taken
with a Zeiss-DSM 950. For microscopic examination the material was mounted in KOH
(4%), NH,OH (2%) and Congo Red-solution.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description of Bolbitius elegans is based upon data taken from collections found
within close vicinity at three different localities. The holotype is deposited in the Herbarium
AH (Alcala, Madrid); isotypes and paratypes are lodged both in GDAC (Herbarium Granada,
Spain) and ZT (Zurich, Switzerland).#Misc-exposition*]

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The most distinctive characters of Bolbitius elegans are the yellow colours of the gaste-
roid, subdeliquescent basidiocarps, the well-developed ixohymeniderm of the pileipellis
and the conspicuous, vesiculose to subglobose cheilocystidia on the lamella edges.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the field the basidiocarps of this taxon with conical and non-expanding pilei can easily
be mistaken either for an aberrant form belonging to the B. vitellinus-complex or for a species
related to the heterogeneous group of gasteroid Bolbitiaceae (Watling & Gregory, 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pileal ixohymeniderm composed of elongate, clavate cells packed into a gelatinous
matrix, clearly suggests a taxon belonging to the genus Bolbitius. Some species of Conocybe
Fayod, which, however, are non-deliquescent, may also have a slightly gelatinized pileipellis,
e.g. C. coprophila (Kühner) Kühner and C. rickenii (Schaeff.) Kühner. In comparison to
these taxa the thickness of the ixohymeniderm in B. elegans exceeds that of the hymenoderm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Following the taxonomic concepts proposed by Bon (1992), only a few species of
Bolbitius (considered as Conocybe by some authorities) actually have typical lecythiform
cheilocystidia, e.g. B. tener Berk. & Broome (= Conocybe lactea ss. auct.), B. lacteus J.E.
Lange and B. crispus (Longyear) Bon. In B. elegans, however, the edges of the lamellae#Misc-exposition*]

[@are exclusively composed of large, broadly clavate to globose-vesiculose cheilocystidia.
This distinctive character separates B. elegans from related taxa belonging to the B. vitelli-
nus-complex, in which the shape of the cheilocystidia and/or caulocystidia usually ranges

from fusiform or lageniform to irregular (Horak, 1968; Enderle et al., 1985; Cacialli et al.,
1995).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Horak et al.: Bolbitius elegans, a new species from Spain 621#Page-header*]

[@Depending on edaphic and microclimatic conditions, the basidiocarps of many taxa of
Bolbitius more or less exhibit a tendency to deliquesce. This phenomenon is also observed
in the new species from Spain. In contrast to other taxa, the rather fast decomposition process
observed in B. elegans does not allow the narrowly conical pileus to expand and thus the
basidiocarps retain the secotioid aspect.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the opinion of Watling (1968), Gastrocybe is probably a secotioid ally of Bolbitius.
The description of the type species, G. lateritia Watling (collected in Michigan, USA), em-
phasizes the hymeniform pileipellis, formed by pyriform, hyaline cells (Babos, 1987). Exclu-
sively based on the assumption of a passive discharge of the basidiospores, Watling (1968)
concludes that G. lateritia should be considered a secotioid genus. However, it must be
stressed that many taxa of Coprinus Pers., developing typical agaricoid basidiocarps, are
also characterized by both deliquescence and passive discharge of the basidiospores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The same year as Watling proposed the new genus Gastrocybe, Heim (1968) described
Bolbitius rogersii (ad. int., nom. nud.) from Africa. This species is defined as a "Galeropsis
charnu ou Bolbitius subangiocarpe?". The macromorphological features of this taxon recall
B. elegans but the two species are readily separated by their microscopic characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subsequently, Singer (1975) and Singer & Ponce de Leon (1982) have considered Heim's
invalidly published taxon as a synonym of Gastrocybe lateritia Watling, whose macrochar-
acters clearly point to its intermediate taxonomic position between bolbitious taxa with
agaricoid and secotioid basidiocarps. In the case of G. lateritia, microscopic features (e.g.
lecythiform cheilocystidia) support a close affinity to Conocybe sect. Candidae (Kühner
ex Singer) Bon. Despite the conspicuous, clavate-vesiculose cheilocystidia observed in the
new Spanish agaric, there is no doubt that Bolbitius elegans also belongs to the complex of
rather polymorphic taxa centred around B. vitellinus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the course of evaluating the identity of Bolbitius elegans, an extensive literature search
[supported by the data published in Murrill (1917), Watling & Gregory (1981) and Watling
(1982)]. referring to taxa described as belonging to either Bolbitius or Pluteolus has been
carried out. The protologues of about 50 species have been screened in detail but no descrip-
tion was discovered which matches the specific characters observed in the new Spanish
representative of Bolbitius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The procedure also included taxa of secotioid genera (Moreno et al., 1989) characterized
by basidiocarps whose general habit recall those of Bolbitius elegans. Accordingly, the
following secotioid species have been critically compared and subsequently found not to
be conspecific:#Misc-exposition*]

it fits well in subgenus Omphaliopsis. Entoloma nubilum and E. carneum are both
characterised by their small, pleurotoid basidiocarps. The first is related to the species
of subgenus Lepronia; the second fits better in subgenus Claudopus. Comments are given
on the taxonomic position of the new species.#Abstract*]

[@Following the publication of a preliminary account of the genus Entoloma s.l. from Kerala
State, India (Manimohan et al., 1995), several interesting collections belonging to the genus
have subsequently been made as part of a continuing study of the agaric mycota of this
region. Based on some of these collections, three new species of Entoloma are described,
illustrated and discussed below. Materials and methods adopted are the same as those given
in the paper cited above. Colour names given in quotation marks and colour codes refer to

[@Entoloma haematinum is a rather unusual species with its very small, bright red, ompha-
linoid basidiocarps. In addition, some microscopical features, such as cuboid spores, absence
of both clamp-connections and pigment encrustations, plasmatic pigment and presence of
inflated-clavate caulocystidia are characteristics of this species. Red basidiocarps are ex-
tremely rare in Entoloma and according to Horak (1980), the Indian species Entoloma nanum
(Massee) E. Horak is the only one known to show this colour amongst the entire range of
Indomalayan and Australasian species of Entoloma studied by him. Entoloma nanum is
easily distinguished by its wine-red to ochre-red, conico-companulate pileus, adnato-adnex-
ed lamellae, smaller, isodiametric-polygonal spores and cheilocystidia. Extensive searches
in the literature revealed no comparable species from other geographical regions. The taxo-
nomic position of this species is also interesting. We place it in the subgenus Omphaliopsis
Noordel. since it does not fit in subgenus Claudopus (A. Gillet) Noordel. because of the
colours and pigments. Cuboid spores are rare in subgenus Omphaliopsis, but do occur in
some African species (Romagnesi & Gilles, 1979). As most species of subgenus Para-
leptonia Romagn. ex Noordel. have clamp-connections and faint encrustations in the pilei-
pellis, it is difficult to place the new species in that subgenus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Entoloma nubilum is characterised by the combination of small, pleurotoid basidiocarps.
dark blue, non-striate pileus, lateral, rudimetary stipe, heterodiametric-ovate spores with 6
or 7 concave facets in profile, cutis-type pileipellis with plasmatic pigment and absence of
both pigment encrustations and clamp-connections. Claudopus cyanomelaenus Boedijn is
the only blue Claudopus reported so far from Indomalaya and Australasia (Horak, 1980).
Not much is known about its variability, however, since the species has only been recorded
once from the type locality in Sumatra. Horak (1980) could not trace the type material. It is
nonetheless clear that Entoloma nubilum, though similar to C. cyanomelaenus in overall
morphology, differs in certain features. According to Horak (1980), the pileus of C. cyano-
melaenus turns red in KOH, whereas the pileus of the present collections does not. The
spores of E. nubilum are also distinctly smaller than those of C. cyanomelaenus. These
features, along with the geographical difference. have led us to describe the collections
from Kerala State as a new species. Entoloma cyaneum (Murrill) Hesler, another blue pleuro-
toid species described from Florida, is somewhat similar to the present collections. However,
itis a lignicolous species with adnate lamellae, a well-developed, white stipe, slightly larger,
5 or 6 sided spores and colourless pileipellis hyphae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomic position of Entoloma nubilum and Claudopus cyanomelaenus is intrigu-
ing. They certainly do not fit in the current concept of Claudopus (treated as either a ‘genus’
or à 'subgenus") because of the blue plasmatic pigment and the total lack of pigment encrus-
tations. It is probably better to consider them as reduced forms in subgen. Leptonia, sect.
Cyanula. As in other agaric genera (c.g. Marasmius, Marasmiellus, Psilocybe) pleurotoid
basidiocarps are found in different parts of the infrageneric classification system and are
by no means unique. For this reason we strongly believe that the pleurotoid habit in Ento-
loma is likewise polyphyletic, and may have occurred several times in the course of evolution
of that genus. Claudopus in the sense of Horak (1980) is therefore an unnatural, hetero-
geneous assemblage of non-related species. For that reason, the following new combination
is made here.#Misc-exposition*]

also distinctive for E. carneum. Entoloma depluens (Batsch: Fr.) Hesler also seems to be
very similar, but differs in having silvery-white hairs on pileus and abundant cheilocystidia.

[@Hydropus paradoxus is an extremely rare taxon; according to our knowledge, it is known
only from the type locality in Switzerland (Moser, 1969). The Spanish collections, which
grow in very xerophytic shrubland areas with poor, basic soils, seem to be restricted to this
vegetation where the presence of Thymus and Lavandula species seems to be constant. The
basidiomata grow directly on soil or more commonly on and around debris under the canopy
of these two characteristic Mediterranean plants. Apart from this typical habitat, the broader
spores and longer cystidia and basidia, seem to be different from those described in the
type collection. Macroscopically both taxa are very similar, and the cartilaginous context
and the ventricose, annexed greyish white gills, which characterise this species, are present
in both taxa.#Misc-exposition*]

three closely related, though different taxa. H. fraterniger s. Hausknecht et al. is characterized by its
first dark grey-brown but later brown pileus with paler ochraceous margin, its lamellae with brownish
grey edge because of the presence of cheilocystidia with vacuolar pigment, and the absence of clamps.

[@TERFEZIA BOUDIERI, FIRST RECORDS FROM EUROPE
OF A RARE VERNAL HYPOGEOUS MYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@G. MORENO, J. DIEZ & J. L. MANJON#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dpto. Biologia Vegetal, Universidad de Alcalá, 28871 Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain
E-mail: gabriel.moreno@uah.cs#Institution*]

[@Terfezia boudieri is reported for the first time from the Iberian Peninsula and Europe. It
is illustrated and compared with material and descriptions of similar Terfezia species
T. arenaria, T. claveryi and T. leptoderma. Specimens of T. boudieri from Spain were
also compared with those from Morocco.#Abstract*]

[@Plants belonging to the Cistaceae, particularly species of Helianthemum, Xolantha, Cistus,
Halimium and Fumana, occur in many semi-arid regions in the Mediterranean basin. Most
of these plants establish mycorrhizas, and have a specific mycota associated with them,
notably hypogeous ascomycetes (species of Tuber, Terfezia, Tirmania and Picoa) (Alsheikh
& Trappe, 1983a; Moreno et al., 1986; 1991; Pacioni & El-Kholy, 1994; Moreno et al.,
2000).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Three species of Terfezia have been reported so far from Spain: T. arenaria (Moris)
Trappe, the most common of those occurring on acid sandy soils; T. leptoderma Tul. & C.
Tul., which also occurs on acid soils but less frequently; and T. claveryi Chatin, typical on
calcareous soils. These desert truffles, traditionally called in Spain ‘criadillas de tierra’ or
‘turmas’ are collected in spring under annual and perennial plants, often Helianthemum
and Xolantha spp. (Moreno et al., 1986). Their abundance in favourable years, their high
market value, and their exportation to Arabia, make them an important natural resource.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As Moreno et al. (2000) point out, these mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in the
maintenance of Mediterranean shrub-lands by preventing erosion and desertification. Hence,
it is important to study these fungi and understand their biology and taxonomy more fully.
In the present study, we describe a rare and little known species, Terfezia boudieri Chatin,
not previously reported from Europe. This hypogeous fungus is collected and consumed,
without knowledge of its specific identity, in the provinces of Madrid and Toledo on cal-
careous and gypsiferous soils.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The material from Spain, herein reported, was compared with specimens of T. boudieri
from Morocco, where this desert truffle is sold in local markets or *zocos'.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic examination and measurement of ascoma elements were carried out in tap
water, 10% aqueous NH ,OH, Melzer’s reagent and Congo-Red. The photomicrographs
were made with a Nikon microscope (Optiphot model), with phase-contrast and automatic
photography. The SEM photographs were taken with a Zeiss DSM-950 microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terfezia boudieri occurs on basic, either calcareous soils or gypsiferous marl. It is charac-
terized by large ascomata, and spores bearing warts over a reticulum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Terfezia claveryi also occurs in such soils, and is macroscopically very similar. Micro-
scopical examination is required to differentiate one from another based on spore ornamen-
tation. Terfezia claveryi has reticulate spores without warts (Fig. 13), whereas the spores
of T. boudieri have warts over a reticulum (Figs. 2-11).#Misc-exposition*]

[@On acid soils, two other species fruit, namely T. arenaria and T. leptoderma. Although
both acidophilous species occur on sandy sites associated with the same host, they are easy
to distinguish from each other. The former has a pale brown gleba with pink tones at maturity
while T. leptoderma has green-olive tones to its gleba at maturity. These species are also
very different in microscopy, the spores of T. arenaria bearing warts with obtuse apices
(Fig. 12), whereas spores of T. leptoderma have long spines (Fig. 14) (Moreno et al., 1986).#Misc-exposition*]

[@There is an excellent iconography of T. boudieri by Ceruti (1960), who reported this
fungus as a common truffle in northern Africa. However, Malencon (1973) curiously did
not mention this species in his broad treatment of North Africa. Pacioni & El-Kholy (1994)
described T. boudieri from Egypt, and provided the first SEM microphotographs of the
spore ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In certain areas of the Iberian Peninsula (i.e. the provinces of Madrid and Toledo)
T. boudieri is consumed by the locals. In certain favourable years, large amounts of this
desert truffle are collected. In these regions, it is called ‘criadilla or turma’, the same name
used to refer to the most abundant and commonly collected species in other regions of Spain
(i.e. Extremadura, western Spain), namely T. arenaria.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Until now, Terfezia boudieri has been known to occur only in North Africa and West
Asia. It had never been reported from southern Europe, though it was likely misidentified
as other Terfezia spp. because of its variable spore ornamentation. We observed that the
features of the ornamentation depend on the spore maturity (Figs. 6-11). At first, the spores
are reticulate with scattered small warts, hence it is easily confused with T. claveryi. Later,
spores become warty as in T. arenaria, but with numerous small warts. Furthermore, we
believe the figure published by Montecchi & Lazzari (1993: 214), showing spores with
rounded warts over a reticulum, likely represents T. boudieri instead of T. claveryi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the Iberian Peninsula, T. boudieri occurs on basic soils associated with Helianthemum
Spp.. either with annual species such as H. ledifolium (L.) Miller or H. salicifolium (L.)
Miller or with perennial species such as H. squamatum (L.) Dum. Cours., the last one a
gypsophilous plant endemic to the Iberian Peninsula.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As Moreno et al. (2000) point out in a previous work, the Iberian Peninsula is located
between the African and the European continents. Moreover, these regions share a helio-
philous flora and the associated mycota, which suggests this region may play an important
role in the migration of mycorrhizal fungi between both continents, particularly of those
species associated with Cistaceae.#Misc-exposition*]

It could not be identified as any of the 25 species known, but is closest to C. ochraceus.#Abstract*]

[@Coprotus Korf & Kimbr. was first suggested by Korf (1954) who later drafted the diagnosis
of the genus to comprise mainly coprophilous species with non-amyloid 8-spored asci,
smooth, hyaline ascospores and uncinate paraphyses i.e. species traditionally placed within
the old heterogeneous Ascophanus Boud. (Korf, 1958). Subsequently Kimbrough (1966),
Kimbrough & Korf (1967) and Kimbrough et al. (1972) extended the limits of the genus to
species with multispored asci, some extracted from Rhyparobius Boud., admitting that their
paraphyses are not strictly hooked and adding new discovered species. For an up-to-date
circumscription of the genus, see Van Brummelen (1998: 427).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the basic paper of Kimbrough et al. (1972) eighteen species were combined, shortly
described and keyed. Moravec (1971), Bell & Kimbrough (1973), Jeng & Krug (1977),
Thind et al. (1978), Gibson & Kimbrough (1980), Gené et al. (1993) and Wang (1994)
added seven more species. No comprehensive study has been made to assess the validity
of the 25 described species, which more often than not are quite obviously difficult to delimit
(Kimbrough et al., 1972). For instance, a recent study on coprophilous Pezizales in Italy
(Doveri et al., 2000) deals with nine taxa of Coprotus of which two could not be assigned
to previously described species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Before dealing with the new species hereafter described we produced a key (not shown
here) to the best of our knowledge for taxa referred to Coprotus! . This comparative approach
confirmed that the informal groups outlined by Kimbrough et al. (1972) within the genus
still hold but that specific delimitations are hard to pin down on the grounds of limited
descriptions of most of the species involved. Nevertheless, the material described hereunder
combines sufficient differential diagnostic characters to be distinguished as a separate spe-
cies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The dung collected was placed in moist chambers for several weeks knowing that
Coprotus species are among the last discomycetes to appear. Freshly collected specimens
were mounted in distilled water in which all measurements were made. Histological details
have been studied from freehand sections. Cotton blue in lactic acid (CB) has only been
tested for its effects on ripe ascospores with non-elastic walls developing de Bary bubbles
artifact. Freehand drawings were made for the illustrations. Photomicrographs were made
with light microscopy with a Leitz microscope using a 35 mm Olympus camera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@De Sloover: Coprotus arduennensis, spec. nov. 653#Page-header*]

[@Criteria commonly used to delimit species of Coprotus are both quantitative and quali-
tative: apothecia colour and size, excipulum extent, ascus and ascospore form and size,
paraphyses form and content. Depending on the relative importance given to these criteria
the resulting classification may be quite different.#Misc-exposition*]

[@De Bary bubbles are consistently induced in Coprotus spores by the use of special mount-
ing media and they have been regarded as one of their taxonomic features (Kimbrough et
al., 1972). To our mind those artifacts created by mounting the spores, e.g. in cotton blue
in lactic acid, must only be viewed as a clue to the thickness or rigidity of the spore walls
(Baral, 1992): they are produced in the same conditions in quite different taxa such as Pyro-
nemataceae like Pulvinula (pers. obs.) and Pseudombrophila (van Brummelen, 1995) or
Thelebolaceae like Coprotiella Jeng & Krug, 1976).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Quantitative criteria, like spore and ascus size, are highly variable in species of Coprotus
from one sample or from one author to another. For C. ochraceus (H. & P. Crouan) J. Mora-
vec for instance, ascospore length is reported as 13.5—17.5 µm (Aas, 1983) and as 15-18
(Moravec, 1971; Ellis & Ellis, 1998). Such data are difficult to handle where means are not
mentioned. For C. arduennensis one of the collections (J. De Sloover 99C111) had smaller
ascospores (9—)10.5 (-13) µm, but agreed with the type in all other aspects: that apparently
aberrant sample could perhaps indicate a slightly deviating taxon of which the delimitation
is not yet clear.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sizes of asci and apothecial diameter also vary greatly. Quantitative data are so variable,
and simple statistical analysis should be considered essential when describing new taxa
but it is far from being a common practice.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Presence vs. absence of carotenoid pigments was proposed by Kimbrough et al. (1972)
as a first order qualitative criterion to found groups within the genus. Yellow to bright orange
colours are frequently noticed in the hymenium of some species of Coprotus, particularly
in the paraphyses in granules or oil droplets. Similar but duller shades have been detected
both in the ascospores and in the excipulum cells and cell walls. It should be noted that the
orange colour of the hymenium, as described for instance in C. aurora, is always the sign
of carotenoid bound lipids in the paraphyses. On the other hand, yellow or yellowish shades
are mostly linked to excipulum wall pigments or to refringent droplets, e.g. in paraphyses.
These quite different origins of colour are not to be confused. In Table I the 26 known spe-
cies are set out so that species sharing the same characteristics are brought together. The
group with lipid bound orange-yellow pigments in paraphyses is limited to seven among
the 26 species listed; most of them have ascospores with light yellowish contents, as well
as a small amount of carotenoids in the excipulum mainly on cell walls. Obviously the
greatest amounts of carotenoids are located in the paraphyses. It should be noted that this
small group of seven species has eight-spored asci. Furthermore, the last nine species listed
are completely devoid of any yellow pigments. They usually possess translucent to white
apothecia except sometimes when drying. Here also are most of the multispored species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Concerning pigmentation Coprotus arduennensis seems related to the group of the other
six species with golden yellow droplets in the paraphyses, i.e. C. breviascus, C. vicinus,
C. aurora, C. luteus, C. baeosporus. and particularly C. ochraceus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Coprotus the excipulum is as a rule poorly developed: this is particularly true in species
like C. disculus (Thind et al., 1978), yet in a few others like C. baeosporus (Jeng & Krug,
1977) or C. sarangpurensis (Thind et al., 1978) it is rather well differentiated with medullary
and ectal layers. Moreover, the hypothecium is absent or at least indistinct as reported, e. g.
in C. ochraceus (Thind et al., 1978). Even though well differentiated, the excipulum thick-
ness and the number of its layers are only reported for seven species out of 25, from two
layers in C. baeosporus, up to a maximum of four in C. vicinus and up to five or six layers
in C. sexdecimsporus (Kimbrough et al., 1972). Ectal excipulum thickness goes from 50—
95 µm, while the medullary excipulum could reach 425 µm as reported in C. ochraceus.
While basal and medullary cells are usually isodiametric or slightly elongated [8-30 µm,
except in C. ochraceus where they may reach 55 µm (Thind et al., 1978)]. cells of the ectal
excipulum along the margins are clearly elongated in most species reaching up to 100 µm
in C. marginatus. In this respect C. dhofarensis is the only one of its kind, where most top-#Misc-exposition*]

[@cells on the upper flank of the ectal excipulum elongate upwards forming a fringe of long
cells exceeding the surface of the hymenium. Here the marginal structure is far more devel-
oped than the one described for C. marginatus, but its cells look like the nearby paraphyses
and the ones described here for C. arduennensis, while C. dhofarensis paraphyses have a
size typical of those in Coprotus. Coprotus arduennensis shows a well-differentiated exci-
pulum with globose isodiametric basal cells up to 45 µm, which are of about the same order
of size as the largest ones that are known in the genus, in C. ochraceus. The sizes of cells at
the excipular margin in C. arduennensis (exceeding 200 µm) are even larger than the largest
reported thus far, in C. marginatus. The cells of the raised margin are also considerably
enlarged in C. arduennensis. t appears that C. marginatus, C. dhofarensis and C. arduen-
nensis form a group of three species where the marginal cells are particularly well developed
in different ways.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thus C. arduennensis shares the same characteristics with the six species indicated in
Table I as having paraphyses with yellow guttules and especially the most richly pigmented
C. ochraceus, C. aurora, C. luteus and C. baeosporus. Moreover, the pronounced yellow
to orange colour of the apothecium is another feature that C. arduennensis has in common
with C. ochraceus and C. aurora. The wide straight cylindrical paraphyses, the larger asci,
the smaller ascospores and particularly the large swollen excipular cells are consistent, and
sufficient to distinguish C. arduennensis from these other species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cortinarius erythrofuscus is referred to the section Firmiores (Fr.) Henn. based on the
size of its basidiomata (pileus 3-7 cm diam., stipe 3.5-10 x 0.4—1.5 cm), whitish veil form-
ing silky fibres on the pileus surface, the markedly hygrophanous pileus and spores with
moderately high ornamentation. However, Cortinarius erythrofuscus can easily be distin-
guished from other species in this section (e.g. Cortinarius biformis Fr.; Cortinarius illu-
minus Fr.) because of the reddish dark brown basidiomata (essentially the flesh of the
pileus and the stipe base), parsley smell and larger spores (Brandrud et al., 1992,
1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The parsley smell might suggest a relationship with Cortinarius rheubarbarinus Rob.
Henry (sect. Brunnei Kühner & Romagn. ex Melot). However, the two species are easily
distinguished, since Cortinarius rheubarbarinus has a different colour and habit, its pileus
is hardly hygrophanous and the spores are smaller (Henry, 1956; Brandrud et al., 1992,
1994 ). Another Mediterranean autumnal taxon with parsley smell is Cortinarius petroseli-
neus Chevassut & Rob. Henry (2 ? C. vernus H. Lindstr. & Melot) (sect. Erythrini Melot),
which is smaller (pileus 1-4 cm diam., stipe 2-6.5 x 0.2-0.5(-0.6) cm), and has quite
different spores (Ortega & Mahiques, 1995a; Ortega & Chevassut, 1998).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cortinarius casimiri (Velen.) Huijsman (7 C. subsertipes Kühner, C. rubellopes Rob.
Henry) has similar spores (Fig. 2) to C. erythrofuscus. Cortinarius casimiri is — like other
taxa of section Hygrocybe (Fr.) Nezdojm. (e.g. Cortinarius decipiens (Pers.: Fr.) Fr., Corti-
narius sertipes f. contrarius (J. Geesink) A. Ortega & Mahiques (7 C. sertipes ss. Kuyper
in Arnolds et al., 1995)) — smaller, with a pileus of 1-5 cm diameter and a stipe of 2-7(—-9)
x 0.2-0.5(- 0.7) cm, the dark reddish flesh is paler and it lacks the parsley smell (Henry,
1937; Brandrud et al., 1994, 1998).#Nomenclature*]

[@It should be noted that, because of its macroscopical characters and the large spores,
Cortinarius erythrofuscus could also be related to some species of section Uracei Kiihner
& Romagn. ex Melot (e.g. Cortinarius uraceus Fr., Cortinarius crassifolius (Velen.) Kühner
& Romagn.). However, the species in this section have darker basidiomata becoming black-
ish on drying, a yellowish to greenish veil and spores with a very marked ornamentation
(Moser, 1983; Brandrud et al., 1990, 1994). Another important character of section Uracei
is the presence of a distinct greenish pigment in the basidia (Brandrud et al., 1990; Melot,
1990), which is absent in Cortinarius erythrofuscus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gymnopus castaneus belongs to sect. Vestipedes (Fr.) Antonín, Halling & Noordel., and
is characterized by its reddish basidiomata, inamyloid spores, the absence of hymenial cysti-
dia, presence of encrusting and intraparietal pigment and absence of sarcodimitic tissues.
Because of the presence of repent to suberect dermatocystidia this new taxon was at first
thought to belong to Hydropus. However, G. castaneus does not have vacuolar pigment,
the trama of the stipe is not sarcodimitic, vascular hyphae are very rare, there are no cheilo-
and no pleurocystidia, and the spores are non-amyloid. In quite a few species placed in
Hydropus by Singer (1982) one or more of these characters are lacking, but in none of them
are they all lacking. Singer (1982: 9) mentioned 12 species with encrusting pigment, but in
11 of these it occurs in addition to evident vacuolar pigment. Only in H. brunnescens did
he describe the sole presence of encrusting pigment. We believe that the latter is not a true
Hydropus but should be included in Gymnopus as well. We therefore propose the following
new combination:#Misc-exposition*]

[@Singer (1982: 48) indicated that G. brunnescens has amyloid spores and cheilocystidia
(which according to him were also observed in other Floridan material). However, we could
not observe these characters in the type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Whilst studying the taxonomic status of this taxon we also considered its inclusion in
Dennisiomyces Singer on account of the absence of vacuolar pigment and the presence of
abundant parietal and encrusting pigment. According to Singer (1982, 1986: 391) Dennisio-
myces differs mainly from Hydropus in the absence of intracellular pigments and the predom-
inantly collybioid to tricholomatoid habit. However, the diagnosis of Dennisiomyces (Singer,
1955) only includes cystidiate species with amyloid spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The very simple anatomy of this taxon points to its inclusion in the Collybia-Marasmiellus
complex, where, according to the monograph of that group by Antonin & Noordeloos (1997),
it keys out in Gymnopus sect. Vestipedes. However, the presence of a strong farinaceous
smell and the absence of cheilocystidia separate Gymnopus castaneus clearly from both
subsections /Impudicae and Vestipedes. The most closely related species within section
Vestipedes is G. terginus (Fr.) Antonín & Noordel. The latter is, however, different from
G. castaneus because of its yellow to reddish brown pileus, its collybioid (never omphalioid)
habit, the presence of cheilocystidia, and much narrower spores (up to 3—4.5 µm).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gymnopus brunnescens, described from Florida is very similar to G. castaneus sharing
the following characters: 1) similar structure of the pileipellis and stipitipellis; 2) absence
of hymenial cystidia; 3) similar pigmentation. The differences between G. castaneus,

A GRASSLAND FUNGUS MIMICKING PORPOLOMA METAPODIUM#Misc-exposition*]

[@EEF ARNOLDS#Misc-exposition*]
[@Holthe 21, 9411 TN Beilen, The Netherlands#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dermoloma magicum is proposed as a new species, characterised by reddening, then black-
ening basidiocarps, a unique feature within the genus Dermoloma. The species has been
collected in grasslands in the Netherlands and Scotland. The collections were initially
identified as Porpoloma metapodium. The differences with that fungus and with related
Dermoloma species are discussed.#Abstract*]

[@During mycological research in 1994 in limestone grasslands in southern Limburg, the
Netherlands, I came across a tricholomatoid agaric with medium-sized, grey-brown basidio-
carps which attracted attention because they stained reddish, then black, when damaged. It
was identified on the basis of macroscopic characters as Porpoloma metapodium (Fr.) Singer,
although the basidiocarps were relatively small for that species. The amyloid spores seemed
to confirm this identification. The record of P. metapodium, listed in the checklist of the
Netherlands by Arnolds et al. (1995) was based on this collection. The following year the
same fungus was collected in another locality in the same region.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the framework of a revision of the genus Porpoloma for Flora agaricina neerlandica
(Arnolds & Noordeloos, 1999) the collections were studied in more detail. It then appeared
that the structure of the pileipellis was a hymeniderm of spheropedunculate cells, sub-
stantially different from the cylindrical hyphae in the pileipellis of P. merapodium. This
combination of characteristics places our fungus in the genus Dermoloma, where no dis-
colouring species have been described so far. In view of its striking colour change I describe
it as D. magicum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Interestingly, I found among the other collections identified as Porpoloma metapodium
in the Nationaal Herbarium Nederland (L), further material with a hymeniform pileipellis,
collected by M.E. Noordeloos in Scotland. It agrees in all relevant characters with Dermo-
loma magicum. It would not be surprising if some other records of P. metapodium have
also been misidentified in the past.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dermoloma magicum is rather variable in some characters. In the collection from Scot-
land the spores are ellipsoid (av. Q = 1.5) and small (6-7.5 x 4—4.5(-5.0) µm). in the
collection from Cotessen predominantly ellipsoid-oblong (av. Q = 1.75) and larger: 7.0-
9.0 x (3.5-)4.0—5.0 µm. The collection from Nijswiller is intermediate in this respect, and
differs from the other collections in the presence of 2- and 1-spored basidia, a feature often
observed in Dermoloma-species and of no taxonomic significance (Arnolds, 1993). In
addition the Nijswiller collection bears some pileocystidia in between the hymenidermal
cells (Fig. 1E), a phenomenon not reported before in this genus. They could not be found
in the other collections. It is unclear whether this character is taxonomically important or
only an accidental anomaly.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the genus Dermoloma, D. magicum is unique in its reddening, then blackening
basidiocarps. In microscopic characteristics this species shows most resemblance to D. pseu-
docuneifolium, for instance in the relatively large spore-size (Arnolds, 1993). As well as
lacking the remarkable discoloration, the latter species also differs in its smaller basidio-
carps (pileus 7-25 mm, stipe 12-50 x 1-3 mm, lamellae 11-21) with darker colours.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dermoloma magicum differs from Porpoloma metapodium not only in the hymeniform
pileipellis, but also in general habit. The latter species has more robust basidiocarps with
the pileus 50—100 mm in diameter, the stipe 10-20(—30) mm thick and more numerous
lamellae (40—50). In addition the stipe in Porpoloma metapodium is concolorous with the
pileus, whereas in D. magicum it is considerably paler than the pileus. The spores in P. meta-
podium are slightly narrower, measuring 6—8 x 3-4 µm (Arnolds & Noordeloos, 1999).#Misc-exposition*]

[@This long awaited worldmonograph of the difficult genus Pezicula appeared in the end of
1999. After the works of Groves (1938-1941) no thorough study has been published for a
long time, although various authors studied the genus in varying depth. This new monograph
is the result of four years of study. In this study also collections were made in the areas
where Groves worked in the past, teleomorphs and anamorphs on natural substrate as well
as in culture were studied, type-specimens were investigated, and some molecular studies
were carried out. Also several species of the closely related genera Ocellaria and Dermea
have been studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The result is a thorough work, with 28 pages of introduction about the history of the
genus, material and methods, discussion on the relation of Pezicula and other genera in the
Dermateaceae, and a discussion on the molecular characterization of the cultured species
with RFLP. The molecular data seem to support the taxa distinguished morphologically.
Keys are given to some related genera, to the species of Pezicula and Neofabraea based on
apothecial characters, and to the anamorphs of Pezicula and Neofabraea based on characters
in vivo and in culture. As a result of the studies Ocellaria is regarded as a synonym of
Pezicula, and the genus Neofabraea is accepted with four species. Three new taxa are
described in Pezicula. Seventy-six taxa mentioned in relation to Pezicula are discussed,
leading to six new combinations in other genera.#Misc-exposition*]
