[@RECONSIDERATION OF RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE
THELEBOLACEAE BASED ON ASCUS ULTRASTRUCTURE#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. VAN BRUMMELEN#Misc-exposition*]
[@Rijksherbarium / Hortus Botanicus, P.O. Box 9514, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands#Institution*]

[@Genera that have been included in the family Thelebolaceae Eckblad are considered for the
structure of the apical apparatuses of their asci. In the absence of such information, other
characters could sometimes be used to clarify their most likely taxonomic position. The
affinities of Cleistothelebolus, Coprobolus, Coprotiella, Dennisiopsis, Lasiobolidium,
Lasiothelebolus, Leptokalpion, Mycoarctium, Ochotrichobolus, and Zukalina are discussed.#Abstract*]

[@The ultrastructure of ascus tops has been studied in Thelebolus microsporus, T. coeman-
sit, T. caninus, T. crustaceus, T. polysporus, T. nanus, T. stercoreus, Caccobius minus-
culus, Lasiobolus pilosus, L. cuniculi, L. monascus, Ascozonus woolhopensis, A. solms-
laubachii, Ramgea annulispora, Coprotus lacteus, and Trichobolus zukalii. At least six
different types of asci can be distinguished within thc fungi studied by electron microscopy.
(1) The first (typical) Thelebolus type, in Thelebolus microsporus, T. crustaceus, T. ster-
coreus, Caccobius, Ramgea, and Pseudascozonus, opening after splitting within the inner
wall layer in the apex, mostly accompanied by a central apical thickening. (2) The second
Thelebolus type, in T. caninus and T. polysporus, with a breakdown of the inner layer in
the apex above the subapical ring, followed by an irregular tear in the outer layer. (3) The
third Thelebolus type, in T. microsporus and T. coemansii, with an irregular operculum
just above the subapical ring. (4) The Ascozonus type, restricted to Ascozonus, with a very
prominent subapical ring and a very small operculum. (5) The Trichobolus type, restricted
to the uni-ascal multi-spored genera Trichobolus and Leptokalpion, without any trace of a
subapical ring or weakened zone, showing a very large operculum or an irregular tear, caus-
ed by a regular retraction of the outer layer from a circular apical region. (6) The asci of
Lasiobolus and Coprotus agree with the earlier defined Octospora type. New combinations
were necessary for Thelebolus coemansii and Ascozonus solms-laubachii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Boudier (1879, 1885) used the presence of an operculum at the top of the ascus as
the main character to subdivide the discomycetes. Since then several groups have been
included within the Pezizales or *operculate discomycetes' that possess asci without an
operculum or with an aberrant opening mechanism (cf. van Brummelen, 1978; 19942).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most families of the Tuberales are now considered as hypogeous representatives of the
Pezizales that have lost the ability to release their ascospores by a shooting mechanism
(Trappe, 1979; van Brummelen, 1994a; 1994b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species of Eleutherascus Arx also show asci without an operculum, but their resemblance
to species of the operculate genus Ascodesmis Tiegh. is so striking in other respects, such
as the development and structure of ascospore ornamentation and the structure of ascan
plugs, that both genera are united in the family Ascodesmidaceae of the Pezizales (van
Brummelen, 1989a, 1989b; Kimbrough, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another group of fungi that most authors include in the Pezizales are those showing an
affinity with the genus Thelebolus Tode: Fr. They possess a variety of dehiscence mecha-#Misc-exposition*]

[@nisms, ranging from a simple irregular apical slit to a conventional operculum, and are
placed in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pezizaceae (Kimbrough & Korf, 1967) or the Pyro-
nemataceae (Korf, 1972), or in a special family Thelebolaceae (Eckblad, 1968). All have
very small globular to disk-shaped ascomata. The development varies considerably from a
type in which the ascomata remain closed until the asci are fully mature (extremely cleisto-
hymenial) to types with a fully exposed development of the asci (eugymnohymenial, van
Brummelen, 1967). The asci are wide and usually protrude far at maturity, are eight- or
multi-spored, with walls not staining blue with iodine. Carotenoid pigments are absent.
The habitat is exclusively coprophilous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Polyspory occurs in most genera and is considered a special adaptation to the copro-
philous habitat to produce large projectiles for a more efficient dispersal. When there is,
within a genus, a range of species with different spore numbers, the eight-spored species
are considered the most primitive (cf. Kimbrough, 1981; Montemartini-Corte, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The original circumscription of the Thelebolaceae (Eckblad, 1968) included nine gen-
era: Ascozonus (Renny) E.C. Hansen, Caccobius Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, Coprobolus
Cain & Kimbr., Coprotus Korf ex Korf & Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, Lasiobolus Sacc.,
Leporina Velen., Thecotheus Boud., Thelebolus Tode: Fr., and Trichobolus (Sacc.) Kimbr.
& Cain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The genus Thecotheus has an ascan wall staining blue with iodine, and should be rc-
ferred to the Ascobolaceae (Aas, 1992; van Brummelen, 1994b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several new, very small, and extremely rare genera have since been added to the
Thelebolaceae, such as: Cleistothelebolus Malloch & Cain, Coprotiella Jeng & Krug,
Dennisiopsis Subram. & Chandrashekara, Lasiothelebolus Kimbrough & Luck-Allen,
Leptokalpion Brumm., Mycoarctium Jain & Cain, Ochotrichobolus Kimbr. & Korf,
Pseudascozonus Brumm., Lasiobolidium Malloch & Cain, and Ramgea Brumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most of these new genera are known only from the description of a single collection
and often insufficient attention has been paid to the structure of the ascus and its dchis-
cence mechanism leaving their taxonomic position uncertain. Some of these genera can,
however, be excluded from the Thelebolaceae on other grounds.#Misc-exposition*]

[@GENERA CONSIDERED RELATED TO THE THELEBOLACEAE#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ascozonus (Renny) E.C. Hansen, with a range of species mainly characterized by the
spore number in each ascus and the shape of excipular, hyphoid hairs, has very small,
cylindrical to obconical, eugymnohymenial ascomata. The asci are cigar-shaped at matu-
rity, 16—256-spored, with a subapical very prominent ring-shaped thickening of the wall
and a small apical operculum (Vuillemin, 1887; van Brummelen, 1974). The ascospores
are hyaline, fusiform, and smooth, without granules or air-bubbles. The taxonomic posi-
ton of the genus is somewhat doubtful; it has been placed in the Thelebolaceae (Eckblad,
1968), in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pyronemataceae (Korf, 1973), and in the Otidea-
Aleuria complex of the Aleuriaceae and Otideaceae ss. Kimbrough (Samuelson, 1978b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Caccobius Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, with a single species, C. minusculus Kimbr. in
Kimbr. & Korf, has very small, discoid, presumably gymnohymenial ascomata, with an
excipulum located only near the base. The asci are cylindrical to broadly clavate, 1000—
1500-spored, at first thick-walled; the wall is not staining with iodine, but the outer wall#Misc-exposition*]
[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 427#Page-header*]

[@layer is uniformly red in Congo red, with an apical plug staining with Waterman’s blue-
black ink in young asci. The ascospores are hyline, smooth, and without guttules or air-
bubbles. This genus was placed in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pezizaceae by Kimbrough
& Korf (1967). But its position remains doubtful, because of the anomalous apical plug
(Korf, 1972).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cleistothelebolus Malloch & Cain, with a single species, C. nipigonensis Malloch &
Cain, produces cleistohymenial ascomata with irregularly disposed, thin-walled, evanes-
cent 8-spored asci. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, and withou guttules or air-bub-
bles. While conidia are produced as blastospores on short peg-like conidiophores. This
is not in accordance with a position close to Thelebolus (cf. also Benny & Kimbrough,
1980). It was initially placed in the Thelebolaceae by Malloch (1970), but soon transferred
to the Eoterfeziaceae (Malloch & Cain, 1971), a family whose position and circumscrip-
tion seem rather uncertain (Malloch, 1994: 398).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprobolus Cain & Kimbr. with a single species, C. poculiformis Cain & Kimbr., has
'bowl- to goblet-shaped' cleistohymenial ascomata that open at an early stage of develop-
ment and are covered with a net of closely appressed bundles of reddish brown pigmented
hairs. The asci are thin-walled, sometimes with a small, undefined thickening at the apex
before maturity, about 250-spored, staining uniformly in Congo red, not blueing with
iodine. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, and easily producing air-bubbles in anhy-
drous media. They have no visible apical apparatus and open with an apical bilabiate split.
The genus was placed by Cain & Kimbrough (1969) in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pezi-
zaceae, close to the genera Caccobius, Thelebolus, and Ascozonus. The type material of
C. poculiformis proved too scanty for an ultrastructural study of the asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprotiella Jeng & Krug, with a single species, C. gongylospora Jeng & Krug, has
ascomata that are globose and remain closed at all stages. The asci are 8-spored, thin-
walled, ‘unitunicate’, ‘non-amyloid’, evanescent, without croziers or apical apparatus.
The ascospores are globose, hyaline, smooth, and produce air-bubbles in certain media
rather easily when fully mature. The genus was placed in the tribe Theleboleae of the
Pyronemataceae sensu Korf (1972) by Jeng & Krug (1977), because of ‘similarity in
many ways to Coprotus’, but in the absence of ascus characters its position remains
uncertain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprotus Korf ex Korf & Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf., is a rather large genus of which
the species are mainly characterized by the size and number of spores in each ascus,
hymenial pigments, and the shape of excipular cells and tips of paraphyses. The ascomata
are cugymnohymenial (van Brummelen, 1967), lenticular to discoid, 0.1—3.0 mm diam.,
hyaline, yellow, or orange, and smooth. The excipulum is of restricted development. The
asci are broadly clavate, 8-256-spored, protruding above the hymenium at maturity; the
wall is not staining with iodine; but the outer wall layer stains with Congo red. The asco-
spores are hyaline, smooth, and easily produce air-bubbles. All species are strictly copro-
philous. The genus was placed in the Thelebolaceae (Kimbrough & Korf, 1967). Kish
(1974) found arguments in cytological and developmental studies on C. /acteus to transfer
Coprotus to the Pyronemataceae emend. Eckblad. A revision of Coprotus for North
America (Kimbrough et al., 1972) included 18 species.#Misc-exposition*]
[@428 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4. 1998#Page-header*]

[@Dennisiopsis Subram. & Chandrashekara has two species, D. octospora Subram. &
Chandrashekara, the type species, and D. multispora Subram. & Chandrashekara. The
ascomata are eugymnohymenial with a complete absence of an excipulum. The asci are
operculate with a thin-walled apex, eight- or multi-spored, and ‘non-amyloid’. The asco-
spores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and easily produce air-bubbles in anhydrous
mounting media, like lactophenol. The genus is considered closely related to Coprotus
and consequently placed in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pyronemataceae by Subramanian
& Chandrashekara (1977).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lasiobolidium Malloch & Cain has two species, L. spirale Malloch & Cain, the type
species, and L. orbiculoides Malloch & Benny. The ascomata are subglobose or irregular
in shape, remaining closed and covered with distinct helical appendages. The asci are 8-
spored, irregularly disposed, without an apical apparatus, and becoming evanescent at
maturity. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, and without guttules and air-bubbles. The
genus was at first placed in the Thelebolaceae (Malloch, 1970), because of a superficial
resemblance to Lasiobolus Sacc., but soon transferred to the Eoterfeziaceae (Malloch &
Cain, 1971). Extensive developmental studies by Janex-Favre & Locquin-Linard (1979)
of L. orbiculoides showed little evidence for a relationship with Lasiobolidium with
Lasiobolus, nor with the Thelebolaceae. In their opinion the early development of the
primordium and the structure of the ascogonial apparatus strongly suggest a relationship
with the operculate discomycetes, especially with the genus Ascodesmis Tiegh.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lasiobolus Sacc., with a number of species mainly characterized by the size, shape,
and number of ascospores and the size of the setae. The ascomata are closed at first
(cleistohymenial) and open in the late-mesohymenial phase, soon covered with usually
unicellular setiform excipular hairs, becoming globose to cupulate, 0.1—1.0 mm diam.,
hyaline, yellowish, or orange. The asci are broadly clavate, with 8 to more than 1000
spores, protruding above the hymenium at maturity; the wall is not blued with iodine; the
outer wall layer stains with Congo red. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth and produce
air-bubbles rather easily in anhydrous media. All species are coprophilous. The affinity of
the genus is clearly with Coprotus. It has been included in the Thelebolaceae (Kimbrough
& Korf, 1967). From the results of ontogenetic studies of L. ciliatus a relationship with
the Pyronemataceae emend. Eckblad has been suggested (Conway, 1975). In a revision
of Lasiobolus (Bezerra & Kimbrough, 1975) eleven species have been distinguished.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lasiothelebolus Kimbr. & Luck-Allen (Kimbrough & Luck-Allen, 1974) is based on
a mixed collection. From accompanying illustrations it was found that the type species,
L. oblongisporus, consist of fruit-bodies of an cight-spored species of Thelebolus partly
overgrown with a phialidic anamorph of another fungus (van Brummelen, 1984). This is
now confirmed by a study of the type specimen (TRTC 45247). Since the Thelebolus
element corresponds most nearly with the original description, that part is indicated as the
lectotype. So Lasiothelebolus becomes a synonym of Thelebolus Tode: Fr. (Greuter et
al., 1994: Art. 9.10).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Leptokalpion Brumm. with a single species, L. albicans Brumm., has paragymno-
hymenial ascomata developing a marginal rim, cach with a single ascus. The asci are#Misc-exposition*]
[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 429#Page-header*]

[@ovoid with a dome-shaped apex, about 4000-spored, with a rather thick, bi-layered wall,
not blued with iodine, and opening by an irregular bilabiate split at the top or by an irreg-
ular operculum the shape of which is defined by the opening of the covering receptacle. A
subapical ring is not observed in the ascan wall. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, and
ejected all together in a single mass; their contents are without oil-guttules or air-bubbles.
The genus was placed in the Thelebolaceae (van Brummelen, 1967).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycoarctium Jain & Cain, with a single species, M. ciliatum Jain & Cain, was placed
in the Thelebolaceae (Jain & Cain, 1973) because of the presence of thick-walled hairs,
resembling those in Trichobolus and Lasiobolus. The asci are clavate at first, without an
operculum or other opening mechanism, and fully evanescent before maturity. Mature,
reticulate, ascospores become exposed as a white, dry, powdery mass between the long,
rigid, curved, uncinate hairs. Because of these characters, the genus Mycoarctium should
be excluded from the Thelebolaceae and transferred to the Onygenaceae (incl. Gymno-
ascaceae).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ochotrichobolus Kimbr. & Korf with a single species, O. polysporus Kimbr. & Korf,
has discoid to scutellate ascomata that are presumably gymnohymenial, with prominent
hyaline, septate, bristly, rooting hairs. The asci are operculate, about 128-spored, and
stain uniformly in Congo red. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and
without oil-guttules or air-bubbles. According to Kimbrough & Korf (1983) O. poly-
sporus shows clear similarities not only with species of Lasiobolus and Trichobolus, but
also with the other setose operculate discomycetes Cheilymenia and Scutellinia. These five
genera, all with setose ascomata, were therefore included in the tribe Scutellinieae of the
Pyronemataceae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pseudascozonus Brumm. with a single species, P. racemosporus Brumm., has small
colourless, eugymnohymenial ascomata without an excipulum. The asci are broadly cla-
vate with a rounded apex, 8-spored, opening either by a small round operculum or by a
bilabiate split at the top. The ascospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and without oil-
guttules or air-bubbles. The ultrastructure of the ascus top revealed (van Brummelen,
1987) the presence of a hemispherical body as a thickening of the inner ascus wall just
below the very irregularly delimited apical operculum (c. 2 µm diam.) and the absence of a
subapical ring. During ascus dehiscence wall layers split easily in the apex (Figs. 17k—n).
The genus Pseudascozonus was considered related to the genus Ascozonus and to ‘Asco-
phanus" coemansii Boud., and was placed in the Thelebolaceae (van Brummelen, 1985).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ramgea Brumm. with a single species, R. annulispora Brumm., has cylindrical to tur-
binate, paragymnohymenial ascomata. The asci are clavate with a dome-shaped apex,
opening with an irregular tear at the top where wall layers are separating above a ring in
the wall. The outer ascan wall stains with Congo red, except for a small apical region,
while the inner wall stains blue with Waterman’s blue-black ink in a small central zone
in the apex. The number of ascospores is variable, but mostly four. An ornamentation of
ring-shaped ridges is formed on their outer surface. Ramgea was placed in the Thelebo-
laceae, close to Caccobius, because of a resemblance in the opening mechanism (van
Brummelen, 1992).#Misc-exposition*]
[@430 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4, 1998#Page-header*]

[@Thelebolus Tode: Fr., has a range of species mainly characterized by the number of
spores formed in each ascus, as the spore-number in each isolate has proved to be con-
stant (Wicklow & Malloch, 1971). The ascomata are small, subglobular, cleistohymenial,
opening in the late mesohymenial or telohymenial phase (van Brummelen, 1967). The asci
are cylindric-clavate to subglobose, 8- to over 3000-spored, thick-walled; the wall not
staining blue with iodine, but the subapical ring and the outer wall layer below the level
of the ring stain strongly with Congo red, leaving the apical dome hyaline (Kimbrough,
1966b; 1972; 1981; Samuelson & Kimbrough, 1978a). The inner layer appears to be
stratified. Prior to dehiscence the wall layers of the apex become much thinner. The de-
hiscence is usually irregular, but occasionally, in 8-spored species, a rather regularly
shaped operculum occurs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The taxonomic relationship of Thelebolus has been a continuous source of speculation.
The genus was considered to be related to: gasteromycetous fungi (Fries, 1823), Peri-
sporiacei of the Pyrenomycetes (Fuckel, 1869), section Ascobolei of the Pézizes (as
‘Ryparobius’; Boudier, 1869), Erysiphales (Zukal, 1886; Cooke & Barr, 1964); Asco-
boleen of the Discomycetes close to Rhyparobius (Heimerl, 1889; Rehm, 1895; Barker,
1903), Hemiasci (Brefeld, 1891); tribe Theleboleae of the Pezizaceae (Kimbrough &
Korf, 1967), subfam. Theleboloideae of the Ascobolaceae (van Brummelen, 1967), and
Thelebolaceae of the Pezizales (Eckblad, 1968). The ascan wall in species of Thelebolus
was found to differ structurally in one major aspect from that of the true operculate spe-
cies: ‘stacks’ of microfibrils of the inner layer were arranged in a banded pattern. This
structure resembled that of the ‘bitunicate’ ascus with a ‘Jack-in-the-box’ opening mecha-
nism (Samuelson & Kimbrough, 1978a; Kimbrough, 1981). Therefore Thelebolus was
considered to be related to the Pleosporales (Samuclson & Kimbrough, 1978a), or the
Hysteriales of the Loculoascomycetes (Kimbrough, 1981), but as the authors state, its
position there is still unclear.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Trichobolus (Sacc.) Kimbr. & Cain in Kimbr. & Korf. is based on Trichobolus zukalii
(Heimerl) Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, a species initially placed in a separate section of
Thelebolus because of the setose cleistohymenial ascomata opening in the telohymenial
phase (van Brummelen, 1967). Two other species, also multi-spored, T. pilosus (Schroet.)
Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf and 7. sphaerosporus Kimbr. in Kimbr. & Korf, are very
closely related to T. zukalii (Kimbrough & Korf, 1967).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure and the dehiscence mechanism of the ascus in T. zukalii were studied by
Heimerl and Zukal (Heimerl, 1889), who reported a complete absence of the ring-shaped
thickening of the ascus wall, so characteristic of Thelebolus stercoreus Tode: Fr.

Krug (1973) enlarged the concept of the genus Trichobolus by adding an eight-spored
species, 7. octosporus Krug, but this has asci with an apical apparatus showing an oper-
culum and a ‘definite apical ring’. Relationship of this species with Lasiobolus was
suggested (Samuelson & Kimbrough, 1978b). While the ascospores in 7. zukalii and
T. pilosus produce ‘de Bary-bubbles’ rather easily, such air-inclusions are not found in
T. sphaerosporus and T. octosporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ascus of Trichobolus zukalii has been the subject of studies by light micro-
scopy (Kimbrough, 1966a, 1972) and electron microscopy (Samuelson & Kimbrough,
1978b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 431#Page-header*]

[@Each fruit-body develops only a single spherical to shortly ovoid ascus, 350-510 x
259—425 µm with a large dome-shaped apex, no stalk and up to 7000 spores. The struc-
ture of the young ascus is not well known. In the later stages the lateral wall is rather con-
stant in thickness and reaches 3.7—4.0 µm in the upper part. The outer layer is an almost
constant 0.8-0.9 µm width in the upper part and c. 1.2 µm lower down, consisting of an
outer stratum strongly staining with silver methenamine and a weaker staining inner stra-
tum, showing a fine lamellation near its inner face. The inner layer, 2.6-3.2 µm thick
stains only weakly with silver methenamine and shows a less clear, fine lamellation. In
the apical region no subapical ring or other differentiation of the ascus wall or of the acro-
plasm is observed. In the mature ascus the apical region of the ascus wall continues to
protrude more and more and becomes gradually thinner towards the top, decreasing from
an initial width of about 3 µm to less than 2 µm at maturity. Ascospore release was report-
ed to occur by a 2—4-lobed split at the top (Heimerl, 1889), by an irregular tear (Kim-
brough, 1966a), or by a circumscissile rupture of the apex (Samuelson & Kimbrough,
1978). No distinct apical apparatus appears to be present.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Trichobolus was placed in the tribe Theleboleae of the Pezizaceae (Kimbrough & Korf,
1967), in the Thelebolaceae (Krug, 1973), or close to the species of the ‘Otidea-Aleuria-
complex’ (Samuelson, 1978d).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Zukalina O. Kuntze was introduced by Zukal (1887) as Gymnodiscus Zukal with a
single species, Zukalina (Gymnodiscus) neglecta (Zukal) O. Kuntze. This remarkable
fungus was observed only once in 1885 on horse dung in Vienna. The ascomata are
gymnohymenial up to 250 µm across with excipular tissue only at the base of the asci.
The asci are multi-spored, about 86 x 21 µm, straight or somewhat curved, and after
throwing off the top cap become 'ear-trumpet-shaped'. The ascospores are hyaline, fusi-
form, c. 10.5 x 3 µm, surrounded by a broad layer of mucus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although this fungus was well described by Zukal (1887) and Rehm (1896) it shows a
combination of characters, which make it difficult to recognize in the absence of authentic
material. Zukalina was placed in the Theleboloideae as a genus of uncertain position by
van Brummelen (1967). Korf (1973) and Aas (1992) consider Zukalina as a possible syn-
onym of Thecotheus Boud. But since the dimensions of ascomata, asci, and ascospores in
that genus are at least twice as large as in Zukalina, a relationship is unlikely. An affinity
of Zukalina with Ascozonus, as suggested by Velenovsky (1934) is more likely. Empty
asci of Thelebolus and Ascozonus may show the truncate shape as described and depicted
by Zukal (1887), especially when, after spore release, the torn remains of the apex above
the subapical ring turn inwards into the ascus below the level of the ring (cf. e.g. Zukal,
1887. 1889; Vuillemin, 1887). However, the presence of hymeneal mucus, ascospores
with mucus only at the sides (Zukal, 1887, Taf. 1, fig. 1c), and the absence of a strong
subapical ring in the ascus do not agree with such an interpretation. The identity of Zuka-
lina remains uncertain.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ultrathin sections were cul using a diamond knife. In most cases selected sections were
treated with the periodic acid-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate procedure (PA-TCH-
SP), a slightly modified Thiéry (1967) technique, as described by Verkley (1992). If not
stated otherwise the material described and illustrated was handled according to these
methods. In addition, part of the material was fixed by using the ultra-rapid freeze fixation
method followed by freeze substitution as described elsewhere (van Brummelen, 1993).
Asci of Caccobius minusculus and Ramgea annulispora were only available from dried
material. Here a few asci were rehydrated in water for 24 hours and then further treated as
fresh material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Photomicrographs of ascus apices were also made with light microscopy with a Leitz

[@OBSERVATIONS ON THE ASCUS APEX#Misc-exposition*]

[@Observations on the structure and differentiation of the lateral and apical ascus wall in
this study are mainly based on electron micrographs of material treated with the Thiéry
technique, since this proved to be the most reliable test for carbohydrates.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the past many results by light microscopy were obtained after staining with Congo
red. This is both an indicator and a stain. As an indicator the dye acid is blue and its (alka-
line) sodium salt red. The red colour of the salt changes easily with a small quantity of
weak acid into blue.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since Klebs (1886) Congo red has been extensively used as a reagent for cellulose. Es-
pecially in alkaline solutions cellulose stains intensely red. But the staining is not very spe-
cific, since it was also found to stain plant mucus, pectines, callose, and hemicellulose. The
staining with Congo red is based, neither on ionogenic nor on chemical bindings, but de-
pends on induced physical dipole forces, where the complexes of Congo red planar mole-
cules neatly fit into the cavities between + parallel oriented fibrils of structural polysaccha-
rides or other fibrillar wall polymers (Frey-Wyssling, 1959; Harms, 1965; Drawert, 1968).
By the polarized character of the Congo red staining, oriented structures that bind this
stain become strongly dichroic. In polarized light such structures show red with light po-
larized in one direction, but green with light polarized perpendicularly (cf. Pearse, 1968).
Such dichroic staining with Congo red does not characterize a certain chemical substance,
but indicates the presence of micellar structures with orientated internal surfaces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The results of more recent investigations of wall components of fungi (van der Valk
et al., 1977; Vermeulen & Wessels, 1986; Wessels, 1990; Ruiz-Herrera, 1992) indicate
that, although Congo red is not very specific, it binds best with not-yet crystallized native
B-glucans, such as in cellulose and nascent chitin (with unbranched chains of acetylgluco-
samine). Since fungal walls are generally rich in chitin in non-crystalline form, these read-
ily stain with Congo red.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In electron microscopy different polysaccharides are localized with the Thiéry tech-
nique. This gives much finer results in the deposition of metallic silver at the site of action
than are obtained with the silver methenamine technique (Martino & Zamboni, 1967).
Structures in fungal walls, that react negatively with the Thiéry-technique are rich in chitin
and §-1—3 glucans, while those that react positively are rich in other glucans and mannans
(Ruiz-Herrera, 1992). Images obtained with the Thiéry technique are therefore not com-
parable with those obtained with Congo red, since this also stains e.g. precursors of chitin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Thelebolus microsporus — Figs. 1a-d, 14a-c#Nomenclature*]

[@Fixed with rapid cryo fixation and chemical fixation, both followed by treatment with
the Thiéry technique.#Misc-exposition*]

[@General — Asci numerous, broadly cylindric-clavate with a short broad stalk and a
rounded apex, reaching 80—125 x 20-26 µm, with 8 smooth spores; the wall not staining
with iodine.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The wall is undifferentiated and of constant thickness, 55—70 nm, in
both lateral and apical parts. Special activity at the site of the future subapical ring was not
observed. There is an outer stratum of strong reactivity 27—32 nm thick and an inner stra-
tum of lower reactivity 32—42 nm thick. A thin reactive periascus is observed from the
beginning and at later stages.#Description*]
[@448 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4, 1998#Page-header*]

[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, about 90 nm thick, becomes more clearly delimited, re-
mains rather constant, and consists of a strongly reactive outer stratum 42—46 nm thick
and a moderately reactive inner stratum 37—46 nm thick. After cryo fixation the inner layer
shows little variation in thickness, laterally the thickness is 93-116 nm, in the apex about
185 nm, while it reaches 230-275 nm in the subapical ring.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — While the outer layer remains unchanged, the inner layer
differentiates into two strata, an outer stratum of low reactivity and an inner of strong reactiv-
ity. The latter is up to 162 nm thick in the apex, becomes gradually thinner in the subapical
region and is scarcely distinguishable lower down the lateral wall. At maturity a great ac-
cumulation of wall material is observed in the apex.#Description*]

[@In cryo-fixed material the inner layer increases up to 700 nm and its inner boundary
remains regular and smooth, although vague in the apex; while in chemically fixed mate-
rial it reaches 740 nm and shows a strongly undulated or folded inner stratum.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before dehiscence the ascus wall stretches strongly.
Regular dehiscence occurs in asci with freely exposed ascus tops. Here the more rigid
outer layer breaks with an irregular tear above the level of the subapical ring, which gives
space for the more flexible compressed inner layer to extend through this opening. Imme-
diately, or very soon afterwards, the inner layer also breaks irregularly and the ascospores
are forcibly released. Structurally the actual splitting occurs within the outer stratum of the
inner layer (“couche c’ of Bellemére, 1977). In asci that are not freely exposed this pro-
cess of regular dehiscence is hampered.#Description*]

[@Thelebolus coemansii — Figs. 2a-c, 14f, g#Nomenclature*]

[@General — Asci numerous, broadly cylindric-clavate with a short stalk and a rounded
apex, reaching 85-110 x 20—25 µm, with 8 smooth spores embedded in a reticulum; the
wall not staining blue with iodine.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The wall is rather uniform with a constant thickness of 60—70 nm in
the lateral and apical parts; consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a less reac-
tive inner stratum. An outer floccose, reactive periascus is present. Exactly at the place
where the future subapical ring will be formed a rather conspicuous annulus 930-1200
nm wide and 210—230 nm thick of moderately reactive wall material is deposited on the
inner face of the single layered young wall. In the neighbouring ascoplasm increased ac-
tivity is observed.#Description*]

[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 70—80 nm thick, consists of a strongly reactive outer
stratum 18—23 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum 46—56 nm thick. The inner layer
shows a uniform thickness of about 100 nm in the flanks, but reaches 265 nm in the sub-
apical region.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness and reac-
tivity. The inner layer is deposited on the inner face of the outer layer as a secondary wall.
The inner stratum of this layer is more reactive than the outer stratum and forms the main
part of the apical wall with a thickness up to 510 nm. It is clearly fibrillose and often
shows internal regions free of reactive wall material, orientated parallel to the surface of
the apex. Often rather large cavities are formed in the apex, which can be easily demon-
strated with light microscopic stains. On ripening the inner surface of the inner stratum
becomes undulated or folded in the entire apex above the subapical ring. At these stages#Description*]
[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 449#Page-header*]

[@the subapical ring is not easily detected, but it can be seen as the narrow region in the wall
where both strata of the inner layer change rather abruptly in thickness. Just above the
subapical ring a weakened zone in the outer wall layer is often observed.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM.#Description*]

[@Thelebolus caninus — Figs. 3a-f, 15a-e#Nomenclature*]

[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a short broad stalk and a rounded or
slightly flattened apex, reaching 105-120 x 30-35 µm, with 32 finely verrucose spores;
the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — Shortly after early ascosporogenesis a secondary wall can alrcady be
distinguished at the inner face of the outer layer (primary wall). The outer layer is uniform
in contrast and thickness 112—140 nm thick, both apically and laterally.#Description*]

[@Lateral wall — The outer layer decreases in thickness to 80—100 nm when it becomes
strongly extended during further development and remains constant in all parts. It consists
of a strongly reactive outer stratum 26—33 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum about
65 nm thick. The inner layer is clearly delimited from the outer layer by a strongly rcactive
boundary line and shows a thickness of 165—195 nm at the sides and reaches 400 nm in
the subapical ring. In this layer usually a moderately or weakly reactive outer stratum,
200—230 nm thick, and a very thin strongly reactive inner stratum can be distinguished.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — While the outer layer remains constant, all further dif-
ferentiation is observed in the inner layer. Especially in the apical and subapical regions
this layer becomes more stratified. An initially moderately reactive inner stratum occu-
pying the major part of the inner layer differentiates into a complex of three to four
laminae of alternating degrees of reactivity. An intermediate lamina of strong reactivity
becomes prominent in the apex of mature asci, but narrows down and ends in the upper
part of the subapical ring.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — In mature asci sometimes the outer layer becomes eroded,
but protrusion of the inner layer at this site is not observed (Fig. 15b). On the contrary in
many mature asci a gradual disintegration and disappearance of major parts of the inner
layer takes place, at first in the apex above the subapical ring, but then also in the lateral
wall, leaving the subapical ring more or less intact. Finally the inner stratum of the outer
layer is also weakened by disintegration. Then the thin outer layer tears open at the apex
with a bilabiate split or an irregular lid, to discharge the ascus contents. The subapical ring
can still be recognized in the discharged asci by the termination of the strongly reactive
lamina of the inner stratum of the inner layer. After discharge disproportional swelling of
parts of the inner layer is a common phenomenon.#Description*]

[@Thelebolus crustaceus — Figs. 4a—c, 5c, d, 14h#Nomenclature*]

[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a broad short stalk and a rounded
apex, 115-140 x 40-52 µm, with 64 smooth spores; the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The primary wall is uniform and of constant thickness up to 160 nm
in all parts, consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a less reactive inner stra-
tum. A periascus is not observed. On further development the primary wall becomes the
outer layer of the ascus wall when a secondary wall is deposited as an inner layer against
its inner face.#Description*]
[@450 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4, 1998#Page-header*]

[@Lateral wall — While the ascus wall increases in thickness in the apex to 950-1125
nm, and in the subapical ring to 1125-1350 nm, it reaches only 500—675 nm laterally.
The outer layer remains almost constant in thickness, 135—160 nm, with an outer stratum
14—23 nm thick and an inner stratum 110—125 nm thick. In the inner layer, 290—450 nm
thick, an outer stratum of low reactivity, 325—370 nm thick, and a strongly reactive inner
stratum, 65—80 nm thick, can be distinguished.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — Further differentiation of the ascus wall is observed in
the inner layer, while the outer layer remains almost unchanged. In the apical and subapi-
cal region the inner layer becomes more stratified. An initially moderately reactive inner
stratum is differentiated into three lamellae with different reactivity. The ending of an
intermediate lamina of strong reactivity is clearly visible in the upper part of the subapical
ring. Also a well delimited strongly reactive lamina about 75 nm thick can be distinguish-
ed in the innermost part of the inner layer. At the level of the ring increased reactivity is
also observed in a narrow region of the outer stratum of the inner layer close to the outer
layer. In apical and subapical regions the boundary between the inner and outer strata of
the inner layer is vague.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM.#Description*]

[@Thelebolus polysporus — Figs. 5a, b, 15f#Nomenclature*]

[@General — Asci 2—5 in each fruit-body, at first broadly clavate, then subellipsoid to
ovoid with a large dome-shaped apex and without a distinct stalk, 80—160 x 60—90 µm,
with 256 smooth spores; the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The primary wall shows a rather simple fine structure consisting of a
strongly reactive outer stratum and a weakly reactive inner stratum throughout the whole
ascus. During early ascosporogenesis an inner layer of weak reactivity is formed at the
inner face of the primary wall. A regular periascus is not observed.#Description*]

[@Lateral wall — During further development the primary wall becomes the outer layer
and remains rather constant in thickness 140—160 nm in all parts and consists of a strongly
reactive outer stratum 45-60 nm thick and an only moderately reactive inner stratum 90—
115 nm thick. The inner layer with a thickness of 480—680 nm is of low reactivity at first,
but later at its inner side a strongly reactive lamina, 55—70 nm thick, becomes distinct.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — Further differentiation is mainly restricted to the inner
layer which becomes more stratified in the apical and subapical regions. A rather strongly
rcactive internal lamina in the apex ends in the upper part of the subapical ring. The rest of
the ring is always of low reactivity and sometimes a vague lamellation is observed. While
the lateral and apical wall are about 770 nm in thickness, in the ring it reaches 910 nm.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM, but light microscopic
Observations show a protrusion of the inner layer trough an irregular rupture of the outer
layer at the apex, and finally a rupture of the inner layer releasing the ascospores (Fig. 4a).#Description*]

ascus expands and the thickness of the ascan wall increases markedly. An internal weakly
reactive layer develops at the inner face of the primary wall which becomes the outer layer
consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a moderately reactive inner stratum. A
perispore is not clearly observed.#Description*]

[@Lateral wall — On further development the outer layer remains constant in appearance
and shows a thickness of about 210 nm in the lateral and subapical region. A strongly
reactive outer stratum of about 50 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum 140—170 nm
thick can be distinguished at all stages. The inner layer is still less reactive, except for a
55—70 nm thick inner stratum, and is very variable in thickness, because of extreme
swelling of its outer stratum. This stratum shows a fibrillar fine structure with elements
parallel to the ascus surface, from 1.2—2.5 µm thick in ripening asci reaching sometimes
more than 9 µm in fully mature ones.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — Most differentiation is restricted to changes in the inner
layer which shows changes in the thickness and also variation in stratification. Because
of this the wall is only 910-980 nm in the apex and increases to more than twice this size
in the subapical ring. In the apex and the upper part of the apical ring the presence of a
strongly reactive inner stratum is accentuated. Both in the apical dome and laterally below
the ring a separation of the outer stratum of the inner layer is observed shortly before
maturity. Because of the low reactivity the fibrillar elements can be distinguished only
with difficulty. In the outer and inner part of this stratum the elements are rather densely
packed parallel to the wall surface. In an intervening zone of increasing thickness between
these parts the elements are irregularly arranged, as if torn apart. If almost mature asci are
forcibly crashed a rupture of the outer layer under the level of the subapical ring is fol-
lowed by separation of the ascan wall along this zone.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before full maturity the ascus increases strongly in
size and the fruit-body forcibly opens, usually exposing the top of the ascus. Within the
apex above the subapical ring a slightly protruding central apical dome about 45 µm across
stretches. When the outer layer in the apex opens with an irregular tear the inner layer ex-
tends through an opening of about 50 µm wide. Immediately, or shortly afterwards, the
inner layer also ruptures, releasing the mature ascospores. During dehiscence all parts of
the inner layer may swell enormously.#Description*]

downwards into a short stalk, with a rounded or somewhat conical top, with 500—1000
smooth spores. The wall not staining in iodine; before maturity a central thickened apical
part of the inner layer stains with Waterman’s blue-black ink.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The wall is already thick from the earliest stages studied. Before asco-
sporogenesis the thickness is rather uniform, 1.6—2.1 µm in the lateral and subapical re-
gions, but increases in the apex up to 3.0 µm. The outer layer, 220—240 nm thick, is at#Description*]

[@first rather vaguely delimited, but becomes more distinct later, especially in the apex, by
increased reactivity. The inner layer, 2.3—2.8 µm thick, shows low reactivity, except for
a narrow zone in the apex at about 160 nm below the outer layer. At this early stage a con-
spicuous thickening develops in the central part of the apex in the inner layer. This central
thickening may reach 3.6—6.0 µm in width and is sharply delimited by folds in the subapi-
cal region. At first it shows little or no differentiation, but during early ascosporogenesis
it becomes clearly stratified by the presence of three to four strata of alternating reactivity.
On further ripening the stratification becomes less evident, but can still be seen as fine
horizontal lines. A perispore is not observed at very young stages, but from early asco-
sporogenesis onwards a more or less continuous or fragmented perispore, 200-1000 nm
thick, of reticulate structure and moderate reactivity is present.#Description*]

[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 210—240 nm thick, consists of a strongly reactive outer
stratum 35-50 nm thick and a moderately reactive inner stratum 160—185 nm thick. The
inner layer, at first 2.3-2.9 µm thick, decreases in size after stretching of the ascus to
1.6-1.9 µm, and is of low reactivity with a subtle but clear stratification as a continuation
of strata in the apical and subapical regions. In the subapical region no evidence of a sub-
apical ring could be found.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — Differentiation is mainly due to changes in the inner layer.
At maturity this layer becomes folded in the subapical region. When the ascus stretches
the fibrillar structure of the inner layer becomes evident.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — At maturity the outer layer of the ascus together with the
outer non-reactive stratum of the inner layer split and open usually at the centrum of the
apex. The central thickening of the inner layer bulges out through this opening, exposing
its thin reactive stratum. The opening remains rather restricted, 5—7 µm, just wide enough
to expose the central thickening. Later the inner layer breaks along the deep folds border-
ing the thickening and the ascus contents are released.#Description*]

[@Here it was observed that the structural and functional inner and outer layer of the ascus
wall do not fully correspond with each other. The separation takes place within the inner
layer close to the boundary plane of its outer and middle stratum.#Description*]

[@Young ascus — The wall is rather undifferentiated and of constant thickness (140—170
nm) in both lateral and apical parts; consisting of a reactive outer stratum, 55—70 nm thick,

[@Lateral wall — On further development the bilayered nature of the ascus wall becomes
obvious. An outer layer (140—180 nm) and an inner layer (420-490 nm) can be distin-
guished, each with an outer and an inner stratum. In the subapical region the inner wall
increases in thickness towards the apex up to 700 nm.#Description*]

[@often strongly reactive, fibrillose inner stratum of the inner layer, reaching a thickness of
420 nm in the apex, but gradually diminishing in thickness in the subapical region, down
to 40 nm. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and the apex this inner
stratum becomes clearly undulated or folded, except for an apical, central flat region, the
future operculum. On the other hand the outer stratum of the inner layer, which is moder-
ately reactive, reaches its maximal thickness in the subapical region. This annular thicken-
ing corresponds both in position and structure with the subapical ring in other species. In
this laminated outer stratum three to five strata may be distinguished after chemical fixa-
tion and Thiéry reaction.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — The opening is by an operculum at the top. The parting of
the operculum from the ascostome is not a single clear fracturing line. In the inner part the
fracture is at the sharp demarcation between the flat and the undulating regions of the inner
stratum of the inner layer. In the outer part the fracture is at the line where the outer stratum of
the inner layer abruptly diminishes in thickness. In the rather wide zone of overlap (1.4-
1.7 µm) between both parts of the operculum separation of the wall layers can already be
observed before the opening. This separation is located at the external side of the inner
stratum of the inner layer.#Description*]

method of fixation the stratification of the inner layer is less evident than after chemical
fixation. In the subapical region the outer stratum of the inner layer increases considerably
in thickness, up to 830 nm, at the level of the subapical ring.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness and in
contrast; a reactive periascus is present on its outer surface. An inner layer, consisting of
two strata, appears to have been deposited on the internal face of the ascus wall. Its outer
stratum is moderately reactive and becomes weakly stratified in the apex and in the upper
part of the apical wall. Its inner stratum is thickest in the apex, up to 420 nm, and becomes
considerably thinner in the lateral wall towards the base (less than 42 nm), where it be-
comes almost indistinguishable. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and
the apex it becomes strongly undulated or even folded.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — The opening is by an apical operculum. The sharp fractur-
ing line in the inner stratum of the inner layer is at the well marked transition between the
flat and the undulated regions in the apex. While the fracture in the outer part is just above
the subapical ring at the level of the outer delimitation of the undulate region of the inner

[@Lateral wall — The outer layer remains almost constant in thickness and reactivity. A
periascus is not observed. On further differentiation of the ascus wall an inner layer is
formed at the inner face of the already existing outer layer. Practically all further changes
in the ascus wall are due to changes in thickness and differentiation in the inner layer. In
this layer a strongly reactive inner and an only moderately reactive outer stratum can be
distinguished. Within this outer stratum often a finer stratification can often be observed
and, especially in the subapical region, a considerable increase in thickness to more than
2500 nm forms a subapical ring of low reactivity.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — At the inner side of the inner layer an inner stratum of
strongly reactive, parallel fibrillar elements reaches a thickness of 1550 nm in the apex,
but gradually decreases downwards till it becomes almost indistinguishable in the lower

stratum becomes strongly undulate. Shortly before dehiscence the future line of fracturing
can be observed at the delimitation of the flat and the undulated region of this inner stra-
tum (cf. Kimbrough & Benny, 1978: fig. 34).#Description*]

ately reactive and not clearly stratified below the level of the ring, except for a 45-65 nm
wide uniform, strongly reactive inner stratum. In the subapical region the inner layer

1.4 µm and a height of 3.1—4.4 µm. The reactivity in the inner layer varies from low to#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before dehiscence the ascus stretches strongly and
the wall in the apex becomes thinner. Weakening of the inner layer is observed in the cen-
tral part by breaking down of wall material. An apical disk or operculum 2.5—3.0 µm in
diameter is differentiated by decreased thickness of the outer layer and a more dense and
granular structure of the inner layer as opposed to a fibrillar structure of the bordering
wall. At dehiscence the operculum tears loose along a circular line and initiates from there
downwards a bilabiate split of the apex above the thick resistant ring and the ascus con-
tents are forcibly ejected.#Description*]

low and 90—210 nm subapically. The inner layer is clearly separated by a reactive bound-
ary line from the outer layer, but internally is not stratified.#Description*]

[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness c. 469 nm
and low reactivity, only in the apical and subapical regions a thin outer stratum, 29-35 nm
thick, of moderate reactivity can be distinguished. A strongly reactive floccose periascus,
85-175 nm thick, covers its outer surface, especially in the upper part of the ascus. The
inner layer which is not clearly differentiated in an inner and outer stratum, is most evident
in the apex 230—275 nm thick and in the subapical region where it gradually diminishes in
thickness to about 45 nm. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and the
apex the inner layer becomes clearly undulated or folded, except for an apical, central flat
region, the future operculum. Only a slight annular thickening can be observed in the sub-
apical wall region of the mature ascus. No differentiation of the wall is found at the level
where in species of Pyronemataceae a subapical ring is formed.#Description*]

[@Dehiscence mechanism — The dehiscence is by an apical operculum regularly shaped
and about 10 µm wide. The fracture starts at the inner face of the inner layer at a rather
sharp demarcation between the flat and undulated regions. Often in mature asci a fissure
can be observed in the inner layer at the apical side of a less swollen region c. 300—500
nm wide with a more reactive inner face (Fig. 12b-e, between arrow-heads). The weak-
ened zone for fracturing in the outer layer is close to the fissure in the inner layer. The
fracturing lines in both layers are close together, thus producing relatively smooth margins
at the operculum and the ascostome. Although the folding of the inner layer in the subapi-
cal region is considerable, a separation of both wall layers in that region is not observed.
After dehiscence the ascus wall near the ascostome swells considerably (Fig. 12e).#Description*]

asci suddenly release all spores. The empty ascus immediately collapses and contracts

tion used for electron microscopy also cause fully mature asci to collapse. The illustrations

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The results obtained with different methods of fixation and contrasting were compared
and not found to be contradictory. The combination of rapid freeze fixation and freeze
substitution followed by the test for polysaccharides with the Thiéry technique proved to
be especially valuable for the study of thin median sections of asci. The images obtained
with this method were not, or scarcely, affected by local and sometimes disproportional
swelling of wall material as sometimes occurs with methods of chemical fixation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The seven species of Thelebolus included in this study show a very similar structure of
the ascus top.#Misc-exposition*]

[@At the earliest stages the ascus shows only a single thin wall layer, which is already
differentiated into an inner and an outer stratum. It is then that wall material is deposited at
the inner face of the wall at the level of the future subapical ring (Fig. 2a), with a process
very similar to that observed for Pyronema (Reeves, 1967) and many other represen-
tatives of the Pyronemataceae s.l. (van Brummelen, 1978; Samuelson, 1978b). Soon
afterwards the activity at the subapical ring becomes far less evident and an inner (second-
ary) layer is deposited at the inner face of the primary outer layer. This two-layered wall
with a subapical ring is common to most members of the Pezizales so far studied and had
already been described by Boedijn (1933) and Chadefaud (1942). The localized thicken-
ing, observed at the ascus top of Thelebolus crustaceus by Czymmek & Klomparens
(1992: fig. 18) represents a rather advanced state in the development of the apical appa-
ratus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The outer layer remains thin and constant in appearance. When viewed by light micro-
scopy the outer layer in Thelebolus stains in all regions with Congo red (Fig. 5c), this
contradicts observations by Kimbrough (1966b) and Kimbrough & Korf (1967), who
described hyaline ascus apices after this staining above the subapical ring and used this
as a distinguishing character for the genus Thelebolus. Ultrastructural observations after
application of the chemically more specific Thiéry technique demonstrates the outer stra-
tum of the outer layer with strong reactivity, while the inner stratum reacts only moder-
ately.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As a rule the outer stratum of the inner layer shows a low reactivity and the inner
stratum a moderate to strong reactivity. These differences in reactivity allow the different
layers and strata to be distinguished and followed, especially when cut exactly perpendic-
ular to the boundary planes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A distinction should be made between the coherence of layers and strata above and
below the subapical ring.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the fungi of this study all changes in the ascus apex take part in the inner layer, This
layer is flexible and usually much thicker than the more rigid outer layer. Often in the
thicker parts sublayering can be observed, where slight differences in density or reactivity
or differences in the main direction of the microfibrils occur. It is important to realise that
very considerable differences in wall thickness may occur due to swelling of the inner
layer. An example is the ascus wall thickness in 7. stercoreus, which normally is 1.5—2.0
µm below and about 900 nm above the subapical ring (Fig. 6c, d), but may reach 12 µm
below and 8 µm above this ring after swelling (Fig. 6c; Samuelson & Kimbrough, 19782:
fig. 45). In such swollen walls microfibrils can be observed with low to moderate reac-
tivity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 461#Page-header*]

[@In the multi-spored species, T. polysporus and T. stercoreus, the inner layer below
the subapical ring may show an inner and outer region with densely placed fibrils more or
less parallel to the surface separated by a less dense region with obliquely or irregularly
arranged fibrils (Figs. 6e, 15i). When mature asci are pressed or crushed in light micro-
scopic preparations, the outer layer may break at a place below the level of the subapical
ring causing the inner layer to separate along this less dense region. When this is followed
by a considerable extension of the clastic and often somewhat folded inner region of the
inner layer this resembles the ‘Jack in the box’ opening mechanism of asci, generally con-
sidered to be typical of ascomycetes belonging to the ‘Ascoloculares’. This phenomenon
is most common in multi-spored species of Thelebolus (cf. van Brummelen, 1978, fig. 36)
but has also been observed, to a less extent, in crushed asci of c.g. Scutellinia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The banded appearance of the internal region of the inner layer in T. stercoreus was
considered of great importance for the taxonomy of that genus by Samuelson & Kim-
brough (19782), since this was considered an important criterium for the ‘bitunicate ascus’
(Reynolds, 1971; 1989). When, however, the structure of the 'bitunicate ascus' in the
Pyrenomycetes was more clearly presented (Parguey-Leduc & Janex-Favre, 1982), more
characters appeared to be involved. The fibrils of the inner layer in this type of ascus are
at first undulated, but soon afterwards they fold into an often rather sharp-edged zig-zag
pattern, The superficial banded pattern in 7. stercoreus, observed by Samuclson & Kim-
brough (1978a), is quite different, but corresponds well with the strongly reactive fibrils
often observed at the undulated or folded inner surface of the inner layer of the subapical
ascus wall in species of Thelebolus, Lasiobolus, and Ascozonus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the structure of the ascus in species of Thelebolus is very similar, different
mechanisms of ascus dehiscence occur, sometimes even in the same species. There are
three main types: (1) Proliferation of the inner layer through an opening in the outer layer
is observed in T. microsporus, T. crustaceus, and T. stercoreus. This mechanism is con-
sidered the most typical for the genus Thelebolus. (2) Weakening and breakdown of the
inner layer in the apex, except for the subapical ring, is found in 7. caninus and T. poly-
sporus. (3) Opening at the top by an irregularly shaped operculum just above the subapi-
cal ring may occur in the 8-spored species, T. coemansii and T. microsporus. But a flat
and rigid differentiation of the inner layer, as present in typical operculates, is not present
in these asci.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This supports earlier views (van Brummelen, 1978; 1994a; Bellemére, 1994) that ascus
structure is more important for the taxonomy than the actual dehiscence mechanism.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The typical Thelebolus type shows: a subapical ring which is very pronounced in
multi-spored species and much less so in 8-spored ones; a splitting of the inner layer
above the subapical ring, beginning from the top downwards; a thick inner layer which
tends to imbibe water and form a central thickening or accumulation of folded or undu-
lated wall material in the whole top region. A tract or a funiculus are absent. The periascus
is thin and rarely preserved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 463#Page-header*]

[@The asci of Caccobius, Ramgea, and Pseudascozonus also belong to the same type,
since central thickenings of different shapes are present in the inner layer at the top and a
weakening occurs by splitting within the inner layer parallel to the wall surface, from the
top downwards. In all cases the outer layer erodes and opens more or less irregularly
allowing the swollen inner layer to extend and break just beside the central thickening.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Sublayering of the inner layer is observed in the central thickening over a varying
period. When treated with Waterman’s blue-black ink during this period fine lines and
cavities are stained blue. The staining with this dye, reported for the study of asci as a
‘chitinoid’ stain (Kimbrough & Korf, 1967; Chadefaud, 1973) is little documented, and
chemically not very specific.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the dehisced ascus in Lasiobolus monascus was not studied with the same
methods as in L. pilosus and L. cuniculi, the illustrations available strongly indicate that
the structure and the morphology are the same. Characteristic of all three species of Lasio-
bolus is the wide zone of overlap between the lines of dehiscence in the inner and outer
part of the operculum. The lines of fracturing in both parts are exactly predictable from the
structure. The perpendicular plane of fracturing in the inner part seems to be preformed.
The wrinkled or undulated region in the inner layer clearly underlines the partly indepen-
dent bi-layered nature of the ascus in Lasiobolus. The plane of the splitting is not exactly
between the structurally distinguished inner and outer layers, but within the outer stratum
of the inner layer, which corresponds with Bellemére’s (1977) ‘couche c’. The inner stra-
tum of the inner layer can easily be distinguished by its strong reactivity.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The structure of the ascus in Coprotus lacteus strongly resembles that of Lasiobolus
and agrees with earlier results by Samuelson (1978c), except that in Coprotus the fractur-
ing lines in the inner and outer part of the operculum are nearer together than in Lasiobolus.
The rather roughly delimited strengthened operculum, without indentation or a prominent
subapical ring, and the insensitivity of the wall to iodine, both indicate the Octospora type
of ascus, which is characteristic of the large family Pyronemataceac. This also agrees with
Samuelson's conclusion that according to ascal structure Pyronema and Coprotus are
most closely related to the Otideaceae and Aleuriaceae sensu Kimbrough (1970).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The two species of Ascozonus studied show a very constant and remarkable structure
and dehiscence mechanism. The ascus opens by a very small, usually somewhat concave
operculum or apical disk (cf. van Brummelen, 1974). Since the opening is too narrow to
allow the passage of the spore mass in the mature ascus top, a bilabiate split from the mar-
gin of the opercular opening down to a very thick and rigid subapical ring occurs during
dehiscence. The inner layer is markedly fibrillar especially near the margin of the oper-
culum. The inner layer in the central part of the operculum is less reactive and more rigid
then surrounding parts (Figs. IOb, c).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Van Brummelen: Ascus ultrastructure in Thelebolaceae 465#Page-header*]

[@A distinct Ascozonus type of ascus top structure is defined by a very pronounced, sub-
layered, rigid subapical ring and a conical apex ending in a small, flat, or usually some-
what concave rigid operculum with a fibrillar margin. A considerably swollen inner wall
is sometimes present (van Brummelen, 1974). And a rather thin periascus not staining
blue with iodine. A funiculus is absent and mature ascospores are typically fusoid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This type differs from the Octospora type (above and van Brummelen, 1978) by the
obvious, permanent subapical ring, the less well defined operculum, the absence of sepa-
ration in the layers at the margins of operculum and ascostome and the absence of a tract
and funiculus. From the Thelebolus type, with which it was previously linked (van Brum-
melen, 1978), it essentially differs in the absence of a process of separation of wall layers
from the centre of the apex downwards.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Trichobolus zukalii is a very remarkable fungus with the largest known operculate
ascus containing up to 7000 spores. The ascus is unique in structure and dehiscence and
as it lacks the fundamental elements of an apical apparatus it is difficult to compare with
the other types of asci already described for the Pezizales. The Trichobolus type is charac-
teriscd by the absence of a subapical ring, annular indentations, preformed weakness zones,
a periascus and a funiculus. Shortly before maturity the inner layer and outer layer both
decrease in thickness at the apex. At full maturity in the free top of the ascus the outer
layer remains behind during stretching, leaving a circular central part free. The inner layer
may slightly protrude. Then, at a certain moment, the inner layer starts to tear open along
the sharp circular border of the outer layer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The eight-spored species, T. octosporus (Krug, 1973), should possess unicellular hya-
line excipular hairs and operculate asci with a definite apical ring, but a study of the type
specimen (TRTC 43801) failed to reveal these characters. So the relationship of this spe-
cies could not be cleared, but is certainly not with Trichobolus or Lasiobolus as suggested
by Samuelson & Kimbrough (1978b).#Misc-exposition*]

[@A process of opening similar to that in Trichobolus zukalii occurs also in Leptokalpion
albicans with a single large ovoid ascus containing about 4000 spores (van Brummelen,
1977). Here the circular shape of the opening at the top of the paragymnohymenial asco-
mata strongly restricts the place and shape of the broadly attached operculum, while bi-
labiate splits can also occur.#Misc-exposition*]

3. Section Phoma: Taxa with conidia longer than 7 µm#Misc-exposition*]

[@J. DE GRUYTER!, M.E. NOORDELOOS? & G.H. BOEREMA?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Eighteen species in section Phoma capable of producing conidia longer than 7 µm arc keyed
out and described according to their characteristics in vitro. A new combination Phoma alie-
na (Fr.: Fr.) v.d. Aa & Boerema is proposed. Indices of host-fungus and fungus-host rela-
tions and short comments on their ecology and distribution are given.#Abstract*]

[@This is a continuation of Contributions I-1 (de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992) and I-2
(de Gruyter ct al., 1993), referring to species with smaller conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Phoma Sacc. sect. Phoma includes species which only produce one-celled conidia.
However, septation may occur preceding germination. Pycnidia with only continuous
conidia can also be found in some species of other sections of Phoma, such as sect. Pey-
ronellaea, which is differentiated by the production of multicellular chlamydospores
(Contr. II; Boerema, 1993) and sect. Plenodomus, which is characterized by the ability to
produce scleroplectenchyma in the pycnidial wall (Contr. III-1/III-2; Boerema et al.,
1994, 1996). In some species of sect. Heterospora, which is distinguished by a large-
sized Ascochyta/Stagonospora-like conidial dimorph, the Phoma-phenotype may produce
only one-celled conidia (Contr. IV; Boerema et al., 1997).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In species of sect. Phoma the conidial dimensions vary considerably, especially in vivo.
The present paper deals with species, able to produce conidia longer than 7 µm. In some
of these species most mature conidia in a pycnidium remain shorter than this but in other
species the majority of mature conidia become longer.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIALS AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates and herbarium specimens were studied as described in the previous Con-
tributions I-1 and I-2 of this series (de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1992 and de Gruyter et
al., 1993). As mentioned in one of our previous Contributions (de Gruyter et al., 1993),
the conidiogenous cells are rather variable, in young pycnidia more or less globose later
becoming bottle-shaped, which means doliiform to ampulliform or lageniform. The growth-
rate has been indicated by diameter of the colony.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF THE
SCUTELLINIA UMBRORUM COMPLEX (PEZIZALES, ASCOMYCETES)
FROM FIVE ECOTOPES IN THE NETHERLANDS#Misc-exposition*]

[@JAANUS PAAL!, BELLIS KULLMAN? & HENK A. HUIJSER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The multivariate structure of the Scurellinia umbrorum complex (Pezizales, Ascomycetes),
based on the morphometrical parameters of 81 specimens from five ecotopes in the Nether-
lands, was analysed. According to conventional expert estimation, five putative taxa resp.
species were established: S. patagonica (Rehm) Gamundi, S. aff. subhirtella Svréek, S. umbro-
rum (Fr.) Lambotte, 5. parvispora J. Moravec and $. subhirtella s. Kullman. These taxa form
à taxonomic continuum hardly separable by traditional taxonomy. Five clusters obtained by
UPGMA (with the generalized J-distance for mixed data as a measure of resemblance) are more
distinct and in good accordance with ecological factors; some of them, however, arc statistically
not well separated. The revision of the clusters’ structure by k-means approach yields highly
discontinuous clusters. The morphometric characters of specimens differ when going from
open habitats to the forest. Differences are also revealed in phenology: the growing season
starts in the forest later than in open habitats. The data are divided into two subsets according
to spore ornamentation and spore width, the withingroup variation of cither subset is caused
mainly by the length of marginal hairs. On the basis of several statistical methods a supposi-
tion was introduced that the S. umbrorum complex probably consists of two polymorphic
species, S. umbrorum (Fr.) Lambotte and S. subhirtella Svréek s.1., with the mean value of
marginal hairs longer than 450 µm and shorter than 450 µm, respectively. The UPGMA clus-
ters can be interpreted as ecodemes of respective species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The systematics of the order Pezizales (Ascomycetes) is disputable and rather unstable
(Kimbrough & Gibson, 1989; van Brummelen, 1994; Bunyard et al., 1995). The sepa-
ration of some species is based on the morphological description of one or two specimens
only. The result is a multitude of putative taxa. When studying more abundant material of
closely related species in Pezizales, an extensive variation of morphological characters
becomes evident.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taking into account that the Pezizales have “a virtually invariant haplophase with pre-
dominantly homomictic mating” (Burnett, 1987; Weber, 1992) it may be considered that
these fungi exist in natural conditions as lineages, i.e. as groups of clones with the same
DNA haplotype. In the genus Scutellinia (Cooke) Lambotte emend. Le Gal there are
homothallic species, c.g. Scutellinia scutellata (Fr.) Lambotte (Gwynne-Vaughan & Wil-
liamson, 1933).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The evolutionary pattern of Scutellinia follows continuous divergence, the substrate
being the most important natural selection factor for these saprotrophic fungi (Kullman,#Misc-exposition*]

Sometimes response to the substrate and other environmental conditions is expressed also
by local ecotypical variability which is revealed in pronounced morphological difference
(Stebbins, 1950; Kullman, 1977, 1995).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present paper aims to (i) analyse the structure of a comparatively large data set of
the Scutellinia umbrorum complex, hardly distinguishable morphologically, (ii) test the
statistical significance of clusters obtained by different phenetic approaches of classifi-
cation of these data, and (iii) analyse the dependence of data structure on substrate and
habitat conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Study sites#Misc-exposition*]

[@The material was collected in the Netherlands during 1979-89. Five localities, consti-
tuting a trophic gradient from ecotopes poor in nutrients to richer ones were studied:#Misc-exposition*]

[@(i) Best-Son (denoted as B). Former loam-pit of brick-work. The habitat represents
a deposition of loam or loamy sand being permanently wet or drying slowly after the re-
moval of loam. Only pioneer vegetation has formed, dominated by Equisetum spp., Salix
spp., Alnus glutinosa, mosses, etc. 16 specimens collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(ii) Nuenen (N). Abandoned loam-pit. Habitat and vegetation quite similar to that of
Best Son. 16 specimens collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(iii) Eindhoven, Urkhoven (E). Paludified meadow with a sparse field layer on sandy-
loamy soil. Traversed by car-tracks. Transition zone between wet heathland and reed
swamp. The main vascular species are: Pedicularis spp., Gentiana pneumonanthe, Dac-
tylorhiza maculata, Platanthera bifolia, Carex spp., Phragmites australis, Sphagnum spp.
7 specimens collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(iv) Helmond, De Schouw (H). Rather open moderately eutrophic moist meadow (hay-
land) on sandy-loamy soil. Traversed by car-tracks. Dominant vasculars are: Carex spp.,
Equisetum spp., and Dactylorhiza majalis. 25 specimens collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(v) Elsloo-Geulle, Bunderbos (L). Eutrophic forest slope (with calcareous springs) on
slowly drying black mud along a regularly overflowing brooklet. Abundant vasculars are:
Equisetum telmateia, Impatiens noli-tangere, Chrysosplenium sp., and Allium ursinum.
16 specimens collected.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Measurements#Misc-exposition*]

[@The characteristics of fungal fruit-bodies were measured with the microscope ‘Olympus
BH-2’, magnification up to 1000 x. Tap water was used as an observation medium. For
all 81 specimens, 4 morphological parameters were measured: length of marginal hairs on
the apothecium (PILL), width of marginal hairs on the apothecium (PILW), spore length
(SPOL), spore width (SPOW). For every specimen all morphological parameters were
measured in not less than ten replications. The mean values were used as initial data for
multivariate analysis. A subtracted parameter, the ratio of spore length to spore width (Q),
was also included in the data matrix. Additionally, the type of spore ornamentation (OR)
was identified as (i) tuberculate, (ii) verrucose, and treated as a binary variable. The type
of ornamentation was studied by staining the spore wall in cotton blue solution in lactophenol
as well as from photographs of the scanning electron microscope (Figs. 1 and 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two nominal characteristics were used as environmental parameters. One describes
the type of the ecotope according to its trophicity and openness from the loam pit to the
eutrophic forest slope (see study sites: B, N, E, H, and L). The other corresponds to the
substrate: S = mineral soil, O = humous soil or decaying wood, W = wood.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Data#Misc-exposition*]

high and 0.3-1.7(-2.5) µm wide. Habitat H.#Diagnosis*]

[@These characteristics are in good agreement with S. patagonica as described by Gamundi
(1975) and Schumacher (1990), but also correspond with S. arenosa (Velen.) Le Gal (Le

[@2. Scutellinia aff. subhirtella Svréek (denoted as Sb)#Nomenclature*]

[@Diagnosis: Apothecia 1.5—10(-15) mm. Marginal hairs 110—650(-720) x 12-35 µm,

[@The marginal hairs fit well Schumacher's (1990) description of S. subhirtella Svréck,
but spore shape and ornamentation deviate too much and look more like his S. umbrorum.
Because of this resemblance such collections have certainly been conceived as S. umbro-
rum (cf. Le Gal, 1947; Maas Geesteranus, 1969; they might even represent the real Peziza
umbrorum Fries, 1823).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Habitats H and E. In H often growing together with S. patagonica which starts fruiting
one or two weeks earlier and differs mainly in the lower Q-value for the ascospores.
During the research period no mixing of the two species could be observed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@These characteristics correspond well with the descriptions of S. umbrorum by Denison
(1959) and Kullman (1982), which are based on the neotypification of this species by the
material of ‘Ellis & Everhart’s North American Fungi’ No. 2911 in CUP. According to
both authors the ascospores of the neotype clearly show a tuberculate ornamentation.
Le Gal (1966a), however, found the ornamentation to be more confluent warty, like in
Scutellinia ampullacea (Limm. ex Cooke) O. Kuntze and therefore rejected Denison’s neo-
type. The diagnosis above does also correspond with the descriptions by Le Gal (1966a)
and Schumacher (1990), which are based on another ncotypification of S. umbrorum by
Le Gal (19662) with the material of Boudier' s Icones mycologicae 2: plate 369, 1906 (leg.
Boudier, Montmorency, 1883, "No. 369", in Herb. Boudier, PC). Unfortunately this

Svréek. According to Schumacher (1990) who studied the type, the spore ornamentation
is tuberculate instead of confluent verrucose. In his monograph no description could be
found which fully fits the above mentioned characteristics. Perhaps it has been included in
his conception of S. olivascens (Cooke) O. Kuntze (= S. ampullacea (Limm. ex Cooke)#Misc-exposition*]

S. olivascens and S. ampullacea by Yao & Spooner (1996) also demonstrated somewhat
larger ascospores. The larger apothecia of the Dutch specimens with hairs up to 1000 µm
look very much like S. umbrorum, but differ in the slightly more slender marginal hairs
and spore ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@DATA PROCESSING#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cluster analysis#Misc-exposition*]

[@For classification the unweighted average linkage method (UPGMA) was used, where
the process of specimens fusion is based on the minimum average distance between spec-
imens and clusters. By this method cluster sizes are considered while recalculating values
in the distance matrix. If cluster i has 1, cluster j has 4 and cluster h has 2 specimens.
then for calculating the distance between newly formed cluster ij and cluster h, djh must
be considered twice as much as di (Podany, 1994).#Misc-exposition*]

[@For optimization of UPGMA-clusters as well as, for testing the stability or invariant-
ness of classification, the k-means clustering (MacQueen, 1967) was used. This method
minimizes the within-cluster variation (sum of squares). The process is iterative: as initial
centers (means) of clusters the centroids of UPGMA-clusters were exploited. Then, in
each step of the procedure it is examined if the relocation of any specimen from one clus-
ter to another provides decrease of the sum of squares. The object for which maximum
decrease may be achieved is moved to the new group. The iterations stop if no further
reduction is possible.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To measure the fit of hierarchical UPGMA dendrogram to the originating distance ma-
trix D, the matrix of ultrametric distances C was computed. The last matrix consists of ele-
ments cjj, which are defined to be the first level in the dendrogram at which specimens i
and j occur in the same cluster (Everitt, 1993). Then, the product moment correlation or the
cophenetic correlation (Sokal & Rohlf, 1962) between these two matrices was calculated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both classifications, as well as estimation of cophenetic correlation were realized by
SYN-TAX 5.0 program package (Podany, 1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ordination#Misc-exposition*]

[@To visualize graphically the specimens’ mutual relationship in multidimensional char-
acter space, principal components analysis (PCA) of In (1 + xij) transformed data was
exploited. By means of PCA new ‘artificial’ variables (scores) are computed on the bases
of the original data in attempt to achieve a more efficient representation of data in few
dimensions (principal components, shown in figures as axes of the ordination). For ordi-
nation CANOCO package, version 3.1 (ter Braak, 1988, 1990), and CANODRAW pack-
age, version 3.0 (Smilauer, 1992) were used.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Estimation of adjacency#Misc-exposition*]

[@When focusing on taxonomic continuum we usually do not mean all possible transi-
tions between clusters but only relations between clusters which are most similar, or
adjacent in the character space. Thus, the number of clusters to which a specimen or an
operational taxonomic unit (OTU) with intermediate characteristics can belong is always
smaller than the total number of clusters. Numerical analysis requires a formal criterion
for deciding whether the clusters should be regarded as adjacent.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Paal, Kullman & Huijser: Multivariate analysis of the Scutellinia umbrorum complex 497#Page-header*]

[@One can postulate: the j-th cluster is treated as adjacent to the i-th cluster if the distance
between at least one of the OTUs of the i-th cluster and the centroid of the j-th cluster is
smaller than the distance to the centroids of all other clusters (Paal & Kolodyazhnyi, 1983;
Paal, 1994). This definition of adjacency is non-symmetric: if the j-th cluster is adjacent
to the i-th cluster, the latter need not necessarily be adjacent to the OTUs belonging to
cluster j.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to such a criterion the distance of all OTUs from all centroids (except the
cluster to which the OTU belongs) can be calculated and the adjacent clusters estimated.
The results are presented in the form of the adjacency matrix.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Testing of clusters’ distinctness#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to measure the degree of distinctness the a-criterion (Duda & Hart, 1976) was
used. To acquire a better interpretation of the estimates, it is more convenient to apply the
corresponding probabilities as coefficients of indistinctness (CI) instead of direct values

(Paal, 1987, 1994):#Misc-exposition*]

[@To visualize the distribution of OTUs located between the centroids of two adjacent
clusters in the character space, the split window method (Parzen, 1962) appears appropri-
ate. The density of the OTUs projection probability distribution on a straight line passing
through the centroids of both clusters can be calculated as#Misc-exposition*]

[@p(x) 5 Un Ej. , (1/h) 6 [(x-x;) / h], (2)#Misc-exposition*]

[@where p(x) is the distribution density at point x, ® — the window function, h — the smoothing
parameter or window breadth, n — the number of OTUs in the cluster, xj — the projection
of the i-th OTU on the line. The density of the normal distribution was regarded as the win-
dow function.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The smoothing parameter h was determined according to the formula:#Misc-exposition*]

[@h = 2s (0.05 + 1 / Vn), (3)#Misc-exposition*]

[@where s is the standard error of the projections. The density of projection probability for
the OTUs of cither cluster was calculated for the line segment + 3s for every 0.1 unit of
the standard error. Normalization to the standard error makes it possible to estimate the
expression of distinctness independently of the number of OTUs in the cluster.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The transition zone between centroids, denoted by two dotted lines perpendicular to the
line connecting the centroids in figures is estimated so that its length is exactly half the dis-
tance between the centroids but, in depending on the within-group dispersion rate, the tran-
sition zone shifts toward one or the other centroid (Paal & Kolodyazhnyi, 1983; Paal,
1987).#Misc-exposition*]

[@expect, because both clusters (4 and 5) were referred to in the expert classification as
belonging to S. subhirtella s. Kullman. Clusters 2 and 4 represent another pair of indis-
tinct clusters (CI2,4 = 10.2); at the same time, clusters 4 and 5 are separated even more
significantly (CI4,5 = 0.0, Table II) than several of the putative species. The probability of
OTUs projection distribution of both clusters is almost normal, and the overlapping of the
corresponding curves quite limited (Fig. 5). According to the adjacency matrix (Table I),
cluster 5 is now closely related to cluster 3, both constituting the third indistinct pair of
clusters (CI5,5 — 76.0, Table II).#Misc-exposition*]

[@If the OTUs 12 and 13 are excluded from cluster 3 as outliers, the classification struc-
ture will not be considerably more distinct. The same cluster pairs will remain indistinct,
only for clusters 3 and 5 the coefficient of indistinctness will be lower (CI3,5 = 29.4,
Table II).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Taking into account that “hierarchical clustering techniques impose a hierarchical struc-
ture on data and it is usually necessary to consider whether this is merited or whether it
introduces unacceptable distortions of the original relationships amongst the individuals,
as implied by their observed proximities” (Everitt, 1993: 72), the cophenetic correlation
coefficient was calculated. In the present case the coefficient is 0.90. This value is close
to the upper bound of the range (0.74—0.90) of most frequently occurring cophenetic cor-
relations (Sneath & Sokal, 1973). Rohlf & Fisher (1968) stated that values above 0.8 are
sufficient to reject the null hypothesis that “The specimens represent a random sample
from a single multivariate normal distribution.” In that way, we can conclude that the ob-
tained UPGMA dendrogram is in good accordance with the real structure of data, and the
loss of information due to arranging the specimens into a hierarchical classification system
is rather limited.#Misc-exposition*]

results (Table HD. Still, adjacency relations for clusters obtained on the basis of the

acceptable, as the first axis accounts for 55.0% of total variance, and the second axis for

explains 3.3% of variation and the fourth 1.2%. Therefore, these axes are not considered
further. The subsequent superposition of clusters onto the ordination plot (Figs. 6 & 7)

[@The principal similarity between the classification structure achieved empirically and
the one achieved by UPGMA is conspicuous. In both cases the specimens of the bigger
subset are separated into clusters parallel to the axis of within-group variation, while the
OTUs of several putative taxa are to some extent intermixed (Fig. 6). The OTUs of the
smaller subset remain all in a separate cluster or clusters. Parallel variation explains also
the large overlapping of the OTUs projection probability distribution (cf. Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@K-means clustering provides spherical clusters; in this case we cannot expect that revi-
sion of the cluster structure obtained by the hierarchical UPGMA algorithm will produce
the same solution as the sum of squares criterion followed by k-means clustering (Podany,
1994). According to the k-means solution, the elongated subsets of OTUs are divided
perpendicularly to the direction of their main variation, and there is no overlapping of

hairs. Cluster 4 includes specimens with short hairs (245—375 µm), while specimens with
longer hairs (450 - 650 µm, Fig. 9) belong to cluster 5. In this way, these clusters corre-

[@DISCUSSION#Misc-exposition*]

[@The statistical indistinctness of empirically estimated taxa demonstrates the dubious-
ness of the conventional taxonomy of the S. umbrorum complex. At the same time, the
present analyses show the sophisticated structure of the data even in case they are collect-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Paal, Kullman & Huijser: Multivariate analysis of the Scutellinia umbrorum complex 509#Page-header*]

[@ed from a rather limited area. Several methods of clustering and comparative analysis of
their results were needed to disentangle the structure of the data. Only after superimposing
clusters onto the ordination plot we were able to grasp mutual relationships between them.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is not simple to say which classification is the most appropriate. The use of cluster
analysis does not simply involve the application of one particular technique, but rather
necessitates a series of steps each of which may be dependent on the results of the pre-
ceding one. The final judgement of the quality of a particular result depends very much
on the fact how informative it is, and what kind of new information it will give (Everitt,
1993).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It became evident that at the five-cluster level k-means clustering best provides signifi-
cantly discontinuous clusters. However, it should be considered that clusters obtained by
k-means procedure are approximately isodiametric, and thus we lose information about
the directional variation of subsets in the character space, which is another important
feature of data structure On the other hand, if the ‘chain’-like configuration of subsets,
related to their variation, is taken into account, not all clusters are distinctly separated.
Figs. 6 and 7 illustrate convincingly these statements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite the lack of discontinuity at the five-cluster level, UPGMA-clusters are ecolog-
ically better justified than k-means clusters. Also, they are in good accordance with the
main features of the data structure by reflecting their division into two subsets according
to spore ornamentation and width, as well as taxonomic continuum caused by the length
of marginal hairs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Still, the decision about the effectiveness of the obtained classification depends most of
all at which taxonomic level we attempt to interpret the results and what the aim of a given
classification is. Contradictory results obtained by UPGMA and by k-means procedure at
the five-cluster level indicate difficulties in regarding either cluster as species. If the result
at the two-cluster level is considered as species, the taxonomy of the Scutellinia umbro-
rum complex should be revised. Then, the first UPGMA-cluster compiling the specimens
of the putative species S. aff. subhirtella Svréek and S. subhirtella s. Kullman morph with
short marginal hairs can be called S. subhirtella Svréek s.1. The other cluster then joins
the specimens of the putative species S. umbrorum, S. parvispora and S. subhirtella
s. Kullman morph with long hairs on the apothecium, and it corresponds to S. umbrorum
s.l. CFr.) Lambotte. Taking into account the good relation of UPGMA-clusters obtained at
the five-cluster level with habitat conditions, these clusters can be interpreted as ecodemes
of respective species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hence, the type of spore ornamentation should not be considered the most important
character for identifying species within the Scutellinia umbrorum complex, as it is tradi-
tionally done (Svréek, 1971; Kullman, 1982; Schumacher, 1990); instead the length of
marginal hairs comes on the first plane. Thus, to S. subhirtella s.l. belong specimens with
hairs shorter than 450 µm, to S. umbrorum s.l. specimens with hairs longer than 450 µm.
The limit of 450 gum should certainly be taken with precaution, only as a pilot point estab-
lished on the basis of data of a recently studied sample.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unambiguous estimation of the type of spore ornamentation is quite often questionable
because this character does not have clearly fixed states but is varying continuously like
almost all quantitative morphological parameters. Van Brummelen (1993) has shown that
the formation of spores ornamentation varies only slightly between Scutellinia species.
Moreover, as it was proved earlier (Kullman, 1982), one ascus can contain spores with#Misc-exposition*]
[@510 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4, 1998#Page-header*]

[@different types of ornamentation. Restriction of the estimation of the ornamentation type to
only two classes is a rather rough simplification which would overemphasize this param-
eter in comparison with other parameters in classification. Therefore, OTUs on the den-
drogram (Fig. 4) as well as on the ordination plot are divided into two subsets namely
according to their spore ornamentation type. If we established at least one more ornamen-
tation type, the result would certainly be different. It is remarkable that the taxonomic
continuum of morphs established by UPGMA appears between the very clusters which
merge specimens with different types of spore omamentation (Table II). The resuk sug-
gests also that two well separated subsets of OTUs on the ordination plot are not located
too far from each other in the character space. Due to the reduction of dimensionality all
ordination plots represent, to some extent, a simplification of the existing relations between
objects and contain an error due to which larger distances become more distorted (Paal et
al., 1989). Dubiousness of the spore ornamentation type as one basic parameter in the
Scutellinia umbrorum complex systematics is confirmed by the results of k-means clus-
tering at the five-cluster level, where all clusters include specimens with both types of
spore ornamentation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the basis of the current analysis we can suppose that the number of species we can
distinguish in the Scutellinia umbrorum complex is not as large as it was so far expected.
At the same time, the morphological plasticity of the species is rather great. The appear-
ance of different morphs, usually interpreted as sister species, seems to be determined by
ecological conditions in the habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The present study was not intended to revise the systematics of the Scutellinia umbro-
rum complex, but to elucidate, by means of different multivariate methods, the complicated
structure of the data and their dependence on ecological factors. It is obvious that in order
to establish more or less invariate systematics of Scutellinia, we still are in need of suf-
ficient data representing the variation of taxa in different ecotopes and geographical re-
gions. Furthermore, more variables should be taken into account. To establish the vari-
ation amplitude of variables by the uniparental species of Scutellinia, cultivation under
controlled conditions is necessary.#Misc-exposition*]

[@NOTES ON CYSTOLEPIOTA:
SECTIONS CYSTOLEPIOTA AND PULVEROLEPIOTA#Misc-exposition*]

[@ELSE C. VELLINGA & HENK A, HUUSER#Misc-exposition*]

[@A key to the species of Cystolepiota Sing., and descriptions of C. cystidiosa (A.H. Smith)
M. Bon, C. adulterina (F. Meller) M. Bon, C. hetieri (Boud.) Sing., and C. moelleri
Knudsen are given. Four taxonomic revisions were made: 1. type studies of C. cysridiosa,
C. luteicystidiata (D. Reid) Knudsen, and Lepiota lycoperdoides Kreisel have revealed these
three species to be conspecific; 2. C. adulterina var. reidii (M. Bon) M. Bon is synonym-
ized with C. adulterina; 3. the type collection of C. subadulterina M. Bon appeared to be a
mixed collection of C. hetieri and C. adulterina, and 4. the genus Pulverolepiota M. Bon,
created to accommodate C. pulverulenta (Huijsman) Vellinga, is reduced to a section of
Cystolepiota.#Abstract*]

[@The European species of the genus Cystolepiota Sing. are assigned to two sections (Bon,
1993b), viz. section Pseudoamyloideae Sing. & Clémeng. accommodating the species
with dextrinoid spores, and section Cystolepiota for species with non-dextrinoid spores.
A third section is added here, to accommodate C. pulverulenta (Huijsman) Vellinga, for
which Bon (1993a) created the genus Pulverolepiota.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Species delimitation in Cystolepiota section Cystolepiota is still problematic, though
recently several books and keys on the genus have been published (Candusso & Lanzoni,
1990; Bon, 1993b; Kelderman, 1994). The authors of the past did not make things easy
for the present-day taxonomist, with their diverse and differing interpretations of names,
the frequent introduction of new names (often not according to the rules of the Inter-
national Code of Botanical Nomenclature) and the use of quite similar epithets (e. g.
hetieri and hetieriana). Some authors appear to attach major significance to small differen-
ces between collections, while neglecting gross and overall similarities. This has resulted
in an undesirable proliferation of names.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most problematic is the group to which the following taxa belong: C. adulterina (F.
Moller) M. Bon with its variety reidii (M. Bon) M. Bon, C. subadulterina M. Bon, C.
hetieri (Boud.) Sing., and C. cystidiosa (A.H. Smith) M. Bon, C. luteicystidiata (D. Reid)
Knudsen and L. lycoperdoides Kreisel. The confusion is caused by the similarities in
macroscopic characters between the species involved, and the fact that they often grow
together, or quite close to each other. Mixed herbarium collections have been encountered
more than once. As already pointed out by Candusso & Lanzoni (1990) it is extremely
difficult to name species from pictures or in the field. Fortunately, microscopic characters
give excellent clues for identification of the species involved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other characters which could prove to be very valuable are the colours of the lamellae
of the exsiccates, the chemical reactions of (parts of) the basidiocarps with FeSO4 and with
NH, vapours, and the spore print colour. Unfortunately, there are as yet no systematic#Misc-exposition*]

collections still preserved in C as lectotype (viz. 1-X-1955, Sender Kohave). A later col-
lection, made by Meller himself, from the type locality was studied for this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Reid (1972) described a collection of C. adulterina. This collection was the basis for
Bon's (19932) variety (first described as a forma in 1981), C. adulterina var. reidii. On
account of the bigger spores and the more pink colours Bon (19932) considers this to be a
good variety. The colours of the pileus are, according to Reid (1972), “beige (Light Pink-
ish Cinnamon)” in young specimens, and “ochraceous (Light Ochraceous-Salmon)" in
older specimens. The codes in brackets are taken from Ridgway (1912). According to
Hamley (1949) they correspond to the following Munsell notations, resp. | YR 8.0/5.0,
and 8 YR 8.0/5.5. Especially the colour of the young pilei of this collection seems to be a
bit more pink than encountered in other collections. To judge whether this taxon deserves
infraspecific rank the type collection of C. adulterina var. reidii (M. Bon) M. Bon was
studied. The microscopical characters are as follows: spores 5.4—6.5 x 2.4—2.9 µm, avl x
avw = 5.9 x 2. 6 µm, Q = (1.9-)2.05-2.4(-2.6), average Q = 2.3; basidia 4-spored;
cheilocystidia 19—32 x 7.0—9.0 µm, lageniform, mostly with up to 17 µm long, cylindri-
cal or slightly moniliform neck; velar elements of pileus globose, 13-28 µm in diam.,
thin-walled. The relatively long spores, the shape of the cheilocystidia, and the small ele-
ments of the pileus covering are all very characteristic for C. adulterina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In all respects, this collection fits perfectly in C. adulterina, and there is no reason to
keep the variety as a separate taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another taxon in this group was named C. subadulterina by Bon (1976a and b). Bon
(1976a) gave a comprehensive description of this taxon (which he described as a new spe-
cies later in the same year). His description clearly combines the macroscopic features of
C. adulterina or C. cystidiosa, and the microscopic characteristics of C. hetieri. The fig-
ures reflect the same ambiguity. Examination of the type collection confirmed the suspi-
cion that two species are involved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collection consists of basidiocarps belonging to C. hetieri and basidiocarps
representing C. adulterina. The microscopic characteristics of the former are as follows:
spores 4.8—5.8 x 2.3-2.5(-2.8) µm, Q = 1.95-2.1(-2.3), average Q = 2.05; cheilo-
cystidia abundant, fusiform and capitate to moniliform, colourless; pleurocystidia present;
elements of velum universale globose and around 35 µm in diameter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The basidiocarps belonging to C. adulterina are microscopically characterized in the
following way: spores 5.0-5.8 x 2.3-2.5 µm, Q = 2.0-2.4, average Q = 2.25; cheilo-
cystidia abundant, with long cylindrical and slightly flexuous neck; pleurocystidia absent;
elements of velum universale globose, 18—30 µm in diameter. These specimens are chosen
here as the lectotype of C. subadulterina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collection was not in a state to reveal further details.#Misc-exposition*]

[@After we had notified Mr. Bon of the identity of this collection, he reduced the species
in rank to a variety of C. adulterina (Bon, 19932), though invalidly, citing the publication
in which he gave a desription of the species (Bon, 19762), rather than the paper in which
the official publication had been made (Bon, 1976b).#Misc-exposition*]
[@518 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 4, 1998#Page-header*]

[@Many authors had difficulties distinguishing C. hetieri from C. adulterina (for example
Breitenbach & Kriinzlin, 1995). This is probably due to the incomplete descriptions of
Moser (1978, 1984), the abundance of names and taxa without a set of well-discrimi-
nating characters as given by Bon (1981, 1993b), and the fact that the original publication
of Moller (1959) is not widely known.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The characters that differentiate C. hetieri most clearly from C. adulterina, are micro-
scopical, and can easily be confirmed on herbarium material: the shape of the spores, the
shape of the cheilocystidia, and the size of the velar elements. The spores of C. adulterina
are longer than those of C. hetieri; the average length-width ratio in the former is 2.1—2.4,
whereas it does not exceed 2.1 in C. hetieri (see Fig. 1, 2). The cheilocystidia in C. hetieri
measure 14-32 x 7-12 µm, with up to 15 µm long, abrupt, capitulate and cylindrical or
moniliform excrescence at apex, and the cystidia are widest just below the excrescence,
whereas in C. adulterina the cheilocystidia have a very long, protruding neck (Fig. 3). But
the exact shape of the cystidia in C. adulterina is often difficult to see; though the necks
are quite obvious. Furthermore, pleurocystidia are often present in C. hetieri, and absent
in C. adulterina. Velar elements of C. hetieri mcasure 20—60 µm; in C. adulterina they do
not exceed 50 µm and are generally around 30 µm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some authors have taken C. moelleri for C. adulterina f. reidii (Lanzoni & Zecchin,
1988; Candusso & Lanzoni, 1990). The differences between the two taxa are very dis-
tinctive, and easily observed, even in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cystolepiota cystidiosa differs from C. adulterina in the presence of pleurocystidia,
which are conspicuous and have yellow contents. The spores of C. adulterina are the
longest and narrowest in this subsection, with an average length-width ratio of 2.1—2.4.
The spores of C. cystidiosa are shorter, and the average length-width ratio is 1.7-2.1.
Furthermore, there is a difference in the size of the velar elements: 13-46 µm in C. adul-
terina, and (10—)20—70(-95) µm in C. cystidiosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collections of C. cystidiosa, C. luteicystidiata and L. lycoperdoides have been
studied. Knudsen (1978) considered C. luteicystidiata and L. lycoperdoides synonymous,
though he did not study the type collections. This opinion was not shared by Bon (1981),
who lowered L. lycoperdoides in rank to a variety of C. luteicystidiata, on account of pre-
sumed bigger size of the basidiocarps and the smell like Lycoperdon. However, Kreisel
(1967) gives the smell as very faint, reminiscent of the smell of L. cristata. The basidio-
carps of the type collection of L. lycoperdoides are surprisingly small.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopic characters of the three type collections are presented in Table I. Judg-
ing from this table and the macroscopic characters (see resp. Smith, 1942; Reid, 1967;
and Kreisel, 1967), there are no reasons to keep them separate. Although American speci-
mens of C. cystidiosa are sturdy and much bigger than the average European basidiocarps,
pilei up to 7 cm in diameter can be encountered in Europe as well.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cystolepiota cystidiosa can be confused with C. hetieri; the spores are of the same size
in the two species. The yellow contents of the cystidia are the best character to distinguish
between the two. The colours of young basidiocarps can be quite similar, but are different
in mature specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the field C. cystidiosa shows a certain resemblance to C. pulverulenta as well. Both
species may have pyramidal warts on the pileus, and also the colours can be rather simi-
lar. The pileus of C. pulverulenta, however, is often quite conical, whereas in C. cysti-
diosa, the pileus is rounded, or umbonate. The two species share certain chemical charac-
ters. Both colour bright yellow by NH3 vapours and both discolour very dark violet-blue
when rubbed with FeSO4, whereas some other species in this group become more green-
ish blue. The microscopical characters, like the shape of the velar elements, and the pres-
ence of cystidia and clamp-connections, are in cases of confusion of decisive value. It is
striking that in C. cystidiosa the velar elements close to the stipe surface show a tendency
to become ellipsoid or even oblong, resembling the velar elements of C. pulverulenta.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is often quite difficult to get a good view of the shape of the cystidia of C. cystidiosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The colour of exsiccates varies greatly; some specimens remained greyish-brownish,
others have become orange-brown. Huijsman (1943) (mis)applied the name L. rufescens
B. & Br. sensu Lange to the latter. In all specimens examined the lamellae are pinkish grey-
brown (7.5 YR 6/3), except in freshly dried specimens, in which the colour is still cream.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cystolepiota cystidiosa is known in Europe mostly from greenhouses, but in the woods
of southern Limburg it has been known to the second author since 1977; more recently
there are records by Kelderman (1994) and Winterhoff & Bon (1994) of occurrences in
the wild.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Plate 210 (as C. hetieri) in Breitenbach & Krünzlin (1995) strongly resembles C. cys-
tidiosa, although the microscopical characters, and especially the spore shape, excellently
fit C. adulterina. Plate 212 (as C. spec.) in the same work, which is there considered to be
different, on account of its yellow-cream coloured spores, resembles C. adulterina, both
visually and microscopically. Little is known about the variability of the spore print colour
in the taxa in this group, and the use of this character in species delimitation remains to be
studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the field, Cystolepiota hetieri can easily be confused with C. pulverulenta. The latter
differs from C. hetieri in the oblong, inflated elements of the veil, the absence of cystidia
and the absence of clamp-connections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cystolepiota seminuda is slender, does not discolour orange-brown and lacks cystidia,
and is therefore easily recognized.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cystolepiota adulterina is often confused with C. hetieri, and some authors doubt
whether it is a separate species. For comments on differences and similarities, see under
C. adulterina. Cystolepiota cystidiosa comes very close to C. hetieri, has similar spores
(both in shape and size), but differs in the colour of the basidiocarps and the yellow con-
tents and exudates of the cystidia and other parts of the basidiocarps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bon (1993b) distinguishes C. langei from C. hetieri, on account of the distinct ring-
like zone on the stipe and the non-moniliform cystidia in the former. Both characters were
found in the material studied, but are not correlated. The shape of the cystidia is very vari-
able, and changes with the age of the basidiocarps.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of the fragmentary state of the holotype, we refrain from re-evaluating the
macroscopic features described by Kalamees (1987) except for the width of the stipe which
hardly could be 1 em wide, as indicated by its author (in dried material not even 1 mm),
and the colours mentioned for the gills which are stated to be grey-brown (in dried mate-
rial pale cream). The microscopic details are based on re-examination of the holotype.#Misc-exposition*]

[@According to the following characters, i) the absence of any trace of vacuolar pigment
in the hyphae of pileipellis, ii) the absence of oleiferous hyphae [more or less rare in
Mycena (Kiihner, 1938), and often present in Hydropus (Singer, 1986)], iii) the densely
diverticulate hyphae of pileipellis embedded in gelatinous matter [according to Singer
(1982), the epicutis in Hydropus is never gelatinized except in cases where the upper layer
of the hypodermium is gelatinized, which is not the case in M. flocculina] and, iv) the
dextrinoid hymenophoral trama (very rare in Hydropus), it becomes clear that this taxon
should be placed in Mycena.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena flocculina belongs to sect. Fragilipedes and is characterized by its long and
peculiar caulocystidia throughout the stipe, its pileipellis embedded in gelatinous matter,
its relatively large and amyloid spores, and the absence of clamp-connections. Within
sect. Fragilipedes this species keys out close to M. deceptor Maas G. (Maas Geesteranus,
19882), which is however completely different.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand, the stipitipellis of M. flocculina recalls that of M. pilosella Maas G.,
but the latter differs in having cylindrical and slender caulocystidia, smaller spores, pres-
ence of clamps, and a pileipellis without any trace of gelatinous matter.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another species which recalls M. flocculina is M. scirpicola (described as new in this
paper), both sharing the greyish brown colour of the pileus, the structure of the stipiti-
pellis, and the presence of similar cheilocystidia. The latter can be separated by the ab-
sence of a nitrous odour, presence of clamps, smaller spores, pileipellis which is not
embedded in gelatinous matter, and the very different habitat (fruiting on dead culms of
Scirpus holoschoenus L.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The first record of Coprinus spadiceisporus Van De Bogart in Europe is described. A
study of the type and that of Coprinus roseistipitatus Van De Bogart revealed that both
are conspecific, and accordingly the latter name is considered synonymous.#Abstract*]

[@Some of us have spent many years studying the taxonomy and distribution of coprophil-
ous fungi in Italy. So far 108 species, 19 belonging to the genus Coprinus, have been
collected and described. Many of these species are quite common and widespread, others
are typical of temperate climates, and some are undoubtedly rare. Among the rare ones is
C. spadiceisporus Van De Bogart, an American species, which is here reported for the
first time from Europe. The morphological characteristics of Coprinus spadiceisporus are
described and compared with some related taxa, including C. roseistipitatus, another
American species described by Van De Bogart (1976), but which we consider synony-
mous with Coprinus spadiceisporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The macroscopic and microscopic features of our collections were independently de-
scribed by each of us before they were compared. It was immediately apparent that this
taxon fitted none of the recognised European species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@To place what was a new European taxon or, possibly, a species known elsewhere,
we searched the literature and found a fairly good structural likeness and similarity
of habitat between our Italian specimens and the taxon described by Van De Bogart
(1976).#Misc-exposition*]

[@To confirm the identification, the type material was studied by one of us (C.B. Uljé).
The microscopic and macroscopic characters were indeed similar to those in our collec-
tions. The spores were slightly larger in the type material (8.2—10.3 x 5.8—7.3 µm; Q -
1.25-1.45; av. Q 2 1.35; av. L 2 9.1, av. B z 6.7 µm), but the quotient and shape were
in good agreement. The study dispelled any doubt and confirmed that our species de-
serves the name C. spadiceisporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus spadiceisporus was described as a new species by Van De Bogart (l.c.) in
the first part of a study devoted to the genus Coprinus in western North America. Hc
placed the new taxon in section Coprinus, after acknowledging that he based his system-
atics on Kühner & Romagnesi (1953).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Uljé & Noordeloos (1997) divided section Coprinus in four subsections (based on
Singer, 1986), mainly on the basis of characters in the veil: subsect. Coprinus (= Annulati
J. Lange), subsect. Atramentarii (Fr.) Konr. & Maubl., subsect. Alachuani Sing., and
subsect. Lanatuli Sing.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this scheme, Coprinus spadiceisporus has to be placed in the subsection Coprinus,
on account of the presence of a ring together with the adpressed, hyphoid veil.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The other species belonging to subsection Coprinus are C. comatus and C. sterquili-
nus. Coprinus comatus differs from C. spadiceisporus in having much larger basidio-
carps, larger spores and a habitat on soil, while C. sterquilinus, though growing on dung,
has larger basidiocarps and spores twice as large.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second taxon, that was also first described and placed in sect. Coprinus by Van De
Bogart (l.c.), is C. roseistipitatus. Its distinguishing characteristics were given as pink-
coloured cystidia and stipe apex, basidia with a median grey pigment band and spores that
are slightly larger than C. spadiceisporus. In the type collection of this species the spores
were indeed found to be slightly larger (less than Van De Bogart found) than in C. spadi-
ceisporus (8.7—10.7 x 6.3-7.9 µm), but of similar shape and quotient. The slight dif-
ference in spore size is not unusual in species of Coprinus and not sufficient in itself to
maintain two species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The pink colour of the cheilocystidia could not be not found in the dried material of the
type collection, nor could the median grey band on the basidia. The pink-coloured apex of
the stipe does not seem to us to be a usable macroscopic feature because of the fact that
white colours often become pinkish in mushrooms, especially under wet conditions.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For these reasons we consider C. roseistipitatus synonymous with C. spadiceisporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although C. spadiceisporus and C. roseistipitatus are each based upon only one col-
lection, Van De Bogart described both species as occurring on rabbit and deer dung (no
annotations were added to the type collections). For C. spadiceisporus he described
clamp-connections as being present, for C. roseistipitatus as being absent. We found only
pscudoclamps in both species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Marasmius celtibericus is characterized by its small size, reddish colour which contrasts
to the whitish-cream hymenium, the very dark central stipe, the hymeniform pileipellis
composed of broom cells, the hymenial cystidia, and almond-shaped spores. In this com-
bination of characters it differs clearly from the other species of Marasmius known in
Europe. Marasmius cornelii Laessde & Noordel. has similar small size, but its pileipellis
is not made up of broom cells, its caulocystidia and cheilocystidia are different, its spores
are narrowly ellipsoid, 12-18 x 3.5—6.5 µm, and it fruits on the leaves of Cladium maris-
cum (Antonín & Noordeloos, 1993). Singer (1976) has reported Marasmius sphaeroder-
mus Spegazzini from Hawaii and Argentina with smooth or fold-like hymenium, but it
differs by its smaller pileus (0.3—0.7 mm), longer stipe (3-15 x 0.08-0.12 mm) and ab-
sence of diverticulate hyphae in the stipe. Corner (1996) has described two species with-
out lamellae from Malesia: Marasmius patellula Corner and M. cyphella Dennis & Reid.
The first differs from the proposed new species in 1-3 mm broad, pale yellowish cream
pileus, the short stipe of only 0.2 mm in length, absence of cystidia and nondiverticulate
hyphae in stipe. Marasmius cyphella differs in the olivaceous brown pileus, lateral rudi-
mentary stipe, tissue above the hymenium containing crystalline masses and absence of
cystidia (cf. Dennis & Reid, 1957, fig. 2).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Marasmius celtibericus belongs to the section Hygrometrici Kühner according to the
classification adopted by Antonín & Noordeloos (1993) on account of its pileipellis struc-
ture. It is related to Marasmius buxi, which clearly differs, however, by its well-developed
lamellae, and habitat.#Misc-exposition*]

anamorphs) from undisturbed tropical forests at various altitudinal zones.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Among the pure isolates obtained from the collected material, two collections, from dif-
ferent years and localities, yielded fruit-bodies of a species belonging to the genus Copri-

[@Coprinus aureogranulatus belongs to subsection Setulosi because of the presence of
setulae on stipe and pileus. On account of the structure of the veil and the shape of the
pilcocystidia, C. aureogranulatus seems rather similar to C. disseminatus (Pers.: Fr.)
S.F. Gray (descr. Uljé & Bas, 1991: 290), but that species has darker brown sphacro-
cysts, longer setulae, and spores that are slightly smaller and of different shape. The
spores of C. disseminatus are ovoid with conical base (submitriform) in frontal view and
ellipsoid in side-view, whereas in C. aureogranulatus the spores are ellipsoid or ovoid
with rounded to convex or even almost flattened base in frontal view and slightly phaseo-
liform in side-view. In addition, cheilocystidia are abundant in C. aureogranulatus, but
lacking in C. disseminatus. In this species only the pileocystidia continue along the edge
of the lamellae over a short distance near the margin of the pileus. Another neighbouring
species is C. pyrrhantes Romagn. (Romagnesi, 1951: 128; Uljé & Bas, 1991: 288), which
can have the same golden-brown colour, but the pileocystidia in that species have a much
smaller, tapering neck, spores that are never phaseoliform and subglobose cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This book is the last scientific paper of the late Prof. Corner, one of the most famous
mycologists of this century. It contains descriptions of about 100 species belonging to
the genera mentioned in the title, many of them being new to science. The author also
presents his views on generic concepts in the marasmioid fungi, which deviates in some
respects from the currently accepted delimitation of Singer, mainly because of the impor-
tance paid to characters such as presence or absence of acerosa basidioles and formation
of secondary septa in the stipitetrama. The fine colour plates add much to the value of this
book.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the third volume of this flora (vol. 2, containing agarics and boletes, appeared in 1992),
the remaining basidiomycetes are treated, including about 1200 species of heterobasidioid,
aphyllophoroid, and gasteroid basidiomycetes. Natural and artificial keys lead the user to
families, and within families keys lead to genera. The keys to the species are hybrid, i.c.
they contain key-characters as well as additional diagnostic characters. For each species
the ecology, distribution and known frequency in the Nordic Countries is given. Much
care has been taken to present these fungi in a modern taxonomic system and updated
nomenclature. Numerous text-figures and a glossary of terms facilitate identification. This
flora is rather unique in its kind, and will find a wide usage, both by professional and
amateur mycologists. It is hoped that the final volume, treating the higher ascomycetes,
will follow soon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This work is the result of many years of taxonomic study and critical revision of authentic
material of most previously described taxa of Hypoxylon. It provides a modern treatment
of the genus world-wide. The chapters in the general part contain surveys of all aspects of
Hypoxylon: history; nomenclature; morphology; teleomorphs and anamorphs; structure of
perithecia, ostioles, asci, and ascospores; evolution; speciation; development, including
important criteria in taxonomy and delimitation. The special part includes: keys to the gen-
era of the Xylariaceae, keys to sections and species of Hypoxylon, and detailed descrip-
tions of the 118 species and 10 varieties included. No less than 48 new names for species
and varieties are proposed. Illustrations are provided of stromata, ascospores, conidio-
phores, and conidia. Special attention is paid to comparison of the results of the present
study with those of an important earlier monograph of Hypoxylon by J.H. Miller in
1961. The book ends with a valuable annotated list (101 pages) of accepted names with
most of their synonyms and homonyms, together with a great number of names that are
excluded from Hypoxylon, or that are doubtful. This work is of great importance to any-
one dealing with the taxonomy or identification of Hypoxylon and related fungi.#Misc-exposition*]
