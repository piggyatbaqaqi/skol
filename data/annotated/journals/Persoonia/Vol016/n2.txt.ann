[@DR. E. KITS VAN WAVEREN#Misc-exposition*]
[@(1906-1995)#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the death on 3 September 1995 of Dr. E. Kits van Waveren, the Dutch mycologists
lost one of their most prominent, internationally known amateurs, a specialist on the tax-
onomy of the genus Psathyrella and an ardent collector.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Kits van Waveren, honorary staff member of the Rijksherbarium at Leiden since
1970 and honorary member of the Dutch Mycological Society since 1983, will be most
of all remembered as the author of the monograph *The Dutch, French and British species
of Psathyrella’ published in 1985 as Supplement 2 of the mycological journal Persoonia.
In this book of 300 pages about 100 species of Psathyrella are extensively described and
illustrated, 10 of which were new to science. This publication, together with 7 later papers
between 1986 and 1995, greatly stimulated the study of the genus in Europe and is still
much in demand. On pp. 289—291 of his book a curriculum vitae of the author is given.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because of the medical and other activities of Dr. Kits van Waveren, there is a large gap
between his first mycological publication on the genera Geastrum, Astraeus and Myrio-
stoma in the Netherlands (1926) and his series of publications on agarics starting in 1968.
But already that first paper is remarkable for that time, because the author thoroughly stud-
ied Persoon's types and strictly followed the then current rules of botanical nomenclature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Also in his later publications Dr. Kits van Waveren showed himself to be a very thor-
ough observer and a meticulous recorder and he soon acquired a professional approach to
mycological problems.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because at first, particularly in the sixties and seventies, Dr. Kits van Waveren still
was medically fully engaged, he kept a strict regime during his mycological season which
ran frem April to deep in November: collecting on Saturday, examination of the collected
fungi on Sunday and checking the outcome of his studies on Monday at the Rijksherbarium.
Collecting in the Netherlands was mainly restricted to a small number of well chosen rich
areas (Amsterdamse Bos, Duin en Kruidberg, Mook, Vorden, Delden and Denekamp),
but later he rather frequently explored a number of areas in Scotland (Braemar), Wales
(Lake Vyrnwy), England (New Forest), etc. Many of his collections are accompanied by
cards with extensive descriptive notes and drawings of spores and cystidia. His herbar-
µm, consisting of more than 5000 collections, has been donated to the Rijksherbarium at
Leiden and is there now incorporated in the general mycological collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Kits van Waveren did not forget the other amateurs. His humorous and witty lec-
tures at meetings of the Dutch Mycological Society were much appreciated and his clear
and well-written more popular mycological papers in Coolia count up to 30.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dr. Kits van Waveren discovered and described 31 new species, while four new spe-
cies have been named after him (Psathyrella waverenii Arnolds 1982, Entoloma kitsii
Noordeloos 1983, Psathyrella kitsiana Orstadius 1986, and Psathyrella waveriana Marchetti
1993). For his role in the resistance during World War II he was awarded the *Verzets-
kruis’, an official and highly esteemed decoration. The Prince Bernhard Foundation
awarded him the ‘Zilveren Anjer’ for his scientific achievements as an amateur in mycol-
ogy.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In 1981 Dr. Kits van Waveren founded the 'Rijksherbarium Foundation Dr. E. Kits
van Waveren’ which aims at promoting research on Agaricales s.l. at or under the wings
of the Rijksherbarium. Although the capital of this foundation was rather modest at first,
it nevertheless facilitated the publication of several mycological books. By a large legacy
Dr. Kits van Waveren has made it now possible for this foundation to finance a series of
fellowships at the Rijksherbarium for many years to come.#Misc-exposition*]

respect and gratitude.#Misc-exposition*]

2. Misapplications of the type species name and the generic synonyms of
section Plenodomus (Excluded species)#Misc-exposition*]

[@G.H. BOEREMA!, W.M. LOERAKKER? & MARIA E.C. HAMERS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Various old records of Phoma lingam (teleomorph Leprosphaeria maculans) on non-crucif-
crous plants proved to be based on misidentifications. In the past the fungus has also often
been confused with other fungi occurring on crucifers. Forty-five species formerly classified
under the generic synonyms Plenod Diploplenodomus, Leptoph and Deuterophoma
were excluded from Phoma sect. Plenodomus, seventeen of them being non-scleroplecten-
chymatous species of Phoma. Asteromella cocogena, Asteromella pomi and Phoma versa-
bilis are described as new species and twelve new combinations are proposed: Ascochyta
aggregata (Hóhnel), Cytosporella cenangium (Corda), Fusicoccum hoveniae (Gucevicz), Pha-
cidiella hiemalis (Desm.), Phoma cruenta (Sydow), Phoma filarszkyana (Moesz), Phoma
haematites (Petrak), Phoma syriaca (Petrak), Phomopsis allescheriana (P. Henn.), Phomop-
sis destruens (Harter), Pleurophoma cava (Schulzer) and Pyrenochaeta corni (Batista & Vital).#Abstract*]



[@The species, subspecies and varieties at present classified in Phoma sect. Plenodomus
(Preuss) Boerema et al. have been treated in Contribution III-1 of this series (Boerema
et al., 1994), They are characterized by their ability to produce scleroplectenchyma in the
peridium of the pycnidium, i.c. hyaline cells with thick walls and a relatively small lumen.
Many of these anamorphs, especially those occurring on herbaceous plants, are meta-
genetically related to scleroplectenchyma-producing species of the Ascomycete genus
Leptosphaeria Ces. & de Not. (group doliolum Holm, 1957). Four genera have been
successively assigned to the section, as Plenodomus Preuss, Diploplenodomus Died.,
Leptophoma Höhnel and Deuterophoma Petri. However, not all species formerly placed
in these genera appeared to belong to Phoma sect. Plenodomus. The type species of the
section, Phoma lingam (Tode: Fr.) Desm., teleomorph Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.)
Ces. & de Not., is very variable. This may explain why the anamorph and teleomorph of
this fungus have been confused with various other fungal morphs.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Firstly, this paper lists alphabetically all species now removed from the above four
genera. Then, the taxonomic part deals with the misapplications of P. lingam/L. maculans,
followed by the species which have been erroneously attributed in the past to the generic
synonyms of the section Plenodomus (‘Excluded species’; in alphabetical order of their
epithets). An appendix deals with some additional collections within the section Pleno-
domus, treated in Contribution III-1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@Original descriptions and, where possible, original herbarium material have been studied
in the light of the present knowledge of coelomycetous genera, in particular the compar-
ative type studies of Coclomycetes by Sutton (1980). Drawings were made with the help
of a drawing tube (oil-immersion at x 1250). The presence or absence of scleroplecten-
chyma was checked by staining thick sections with Lugol's iodine: cell-walls becoming
red by adsorption of the iodine (JKJ+) or remaining white by non-adsorption (JKJ-).
Herbaria and culture collections are coded according to, respectively, Holmgren &
Keuken (1974) and Pridham (1974).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The forty-five excluded species are treated in alphabetical order by epithet.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the past, the above generic synonyms have been repeatedly misinterpreted, even by
experienced mycologists. Von Hóhnel (1909) treated Plenodomus Preuss initially as an
older synonym of Phomopsis (Sacc.) Sacc. (background of the misapplications nos 7,
23, 29, 32, 36, 39 and 44). It explains the introduction of Leptophoma Hóhnel (1915a),
which was based on the typical Plenodomus-anamorph of Leptosphaeria doliolum (Pers.:
Fr.) Ces. & de Not. on dead stems of stinging nettle, Urtica dioica. However, the sclero-
plectenchymatous wall structure was not noticed as an essential character (misappl. no.
33) and a proposed change in the description of Leptophoma by Von Hóhnel (1917: 262—
263) also erroneously includes the conidiogenous characteristics of a Pyrenochaeta spc-
cies which occasionally occurs on dead stems of nettle (misappl. no. 43). In 1918 Von
Hóhnel finally accepted the synonymy of his Leptophoma with the carlier Plenodomus.
Diedicke (1911, 1912a, b) usually interpreted Plenodomus correctly (except in case no.
21) and separated Diploplenodomus for species with some |-septate conidia. The type
species of Deuterophoma Petri (1929; referring to still closed scleroplectenchymatous
pycnidia) additionally produces conidia on free conidiogenous cells on the mycelium:
Phialophora synanamorph. This phenomenon, however, may also occur in non-sclero-
plectenchymatous vascular-inhabiting Phoma-like fungi (misappl. nos 9 and 42). Oude-
mans (1885, 1897) did not fully understand the generic characteristics of Plenodomus
(misappl. nos 6, 15 and 19). The same holds for Saccardo (1903, 1913; misappl. nos 2
and 24) and various other authors of Plenodomus-binomials (misappl. nos 4, 5, 8, 10,
11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31 and 35). Various typical species of Pleno-
domus are described by Petrak (see Contribution III-1), but occasionally he did not give
due consideration to the wall structure (misappl. nos 37 and 38). He emphasizes the meta-
genetic relation with Leptosphaeria species (Petrak, 1947; misappl. nos 3, 17, 20 and 34),
but also associated Plenodomus with species of Didymella (see Boerema & van Kesteren,
1981: 325 and misappl. nos 25 and 41).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Coelomycetes the occurrence of scleroplectenchyma is admittedly not restricted to

[@= Phomopsis sp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collection of Plenodomus borgianus was examined by Dr. B.C. Sutton (IMI)
who wrote to us: “I think there is no doubt about this being a species of Phomopsis pro-
ducing a-conidia.”” The fungus is characterized by biguttulate fusiform conidia, (5—)5.5—
6.5(—7) x 2 µm, formed from verticillately branched conidiophores with terminal phialides,
and thick-walled, initially ‘sclerotioid’ pycnidia, separate or aggregate, up to 700 µm diam.
There are no other records of such a fungus on Cucurbitaceae. The species is quite differ-
ent from Phomopsis cucurbitae McKeen (1957) [with «- and B-conidia}, the causal organ-
ism of *Fruit- and Stem rot’ of cucurbits, and Phomopsis sclerotioides van Kesteren
(1967) [with short, only occasionally septate conidiophores], causing 'Black Root Rot' in
Cucurbitaceae. There is, however, a strong resemblance to Phomopsis obscurans (Ell. &
Ev.) Sutton (1965), a cosmopolitan recorded foliicolous pathogen of Fragaria spp. (*Straw-
berry Leaf Blight’). The latter grows very well on various artificial media and then often
produces large stromatic masses of aggregated pycnidia. An accidental occurrence of
Phomopsis obscurans on pumpkin fruit is quite well possible. [Such casual findings are
often associated with various pathogenic Phoma spp., see Boerema, 1975.}#Misc-exposition*]

[@= Phomopsis sp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The description as well as the cultural characters of this fungus clearly point to a spe-
cies of Phomopsis (Sacc.) Sacc. with only a-conidia. The placement in Plenodomus was
probably based on the paper by Von Hóhnel (1909) in which Plenodomus Preuss was
treated as an older synonym of Phomopsis (recanted by Von Höhnel, 1918). The fungus
was characterized by indistinct ostiolate conidiomata, 300—500 µm diam. and 300 µm
high, with relatively long conidiophores, 22-30 µm; dimensions of a-conidia 5.5-7.2 x
2.7 µm. The characteristics of conidiophores and conidia are reminiscent of Phomopsis
morphaea (Sacc.) Grove, Bull. misc. Inf. R. bot. Gdns Kew 2 (1917) 70, originally de-
scribed on stems of Papaveris orientale in Italy. The latter, however, should produce very
small conidiomata, c. 150 µm diam. For a discussion on the species concept in the genus

[@The initial classification of this fungus as Deuterophoma, infecting the vascular system
in Chrysanthemum spp. (Slow Wilt, Decline Disease), rested on the production of *Cepha-
losporium-like’ hyphal conidia (= Phialophora synanamorph), a feature of Phoma trachei-
phila (Petri) Kant. & Gik. (Contribution III-1 no. 21), the type species of Petri's genus
Deuterophoma. Both fungi have about the same dimensions of pycnidia, pycnidial conidia
and hyphal conidia. Phoma tracheiphila is also a vascular pathogen, the causal organism
of wilt and dieback of lemons and other Citrus spp. (Mal Secco Disease). Due to the simi-
larities, Baker et al. (1985) proposed P. tracheiphila f. sp. chrysanthemi for the chrysan-
themum pathogen. However, apart from the quite different hosts and improbability of
common origin, there are essential morphological differences. The most important argu-
ment for differentiating the chrysanthemum pathogen at species level has been the absence
of scleroplectenchyma (Boerema ct al., 1994). Furthermore, the pseudoparenchymatous
pyenidia of Phoma vasinfecta, (55—)75 -100(—160) µm diam., have only slightly elon-
gated necks (neck at the most 40 µm, whilst in P. tracheiphila it is up to 250 µm long);
conidia mostly (2-)2.5-3(-4) x 1-1.5 µm. The Phialophora synanamorph of P. vasin-
fecta is indistinguishable from Phialophora chrysanthemi (Zachos et al.) W. Gams, with

[@The type collection, cultures and the original description of this well-known pathogen

biguttulate ellipsoidal a-conidia, mostly 7-10 x 3.5—4 µm, borne on filiform conidio-
phores, and often mixed with oblong-fusoid ‘y'-conidia without guttules (compare Das
Gupta, 1930, figs. 5—7). Harter (1.c.) already noted that the fungus "does not fit exactly
the description of Plenodomus" and that it "has some characteristics of Phomopsis". But
in his opinion it differed from Phomopsis by wall structure, “two instead of four walls",
“dark outer wall which is conspicuous at the top and base of the pycnidia”, and “in having
no chambering of the pycnidium” and “in not being stromatic”. In Phomopsis, however,
the thickness and darkness of the wall and the presence of stromatic tissue is highly vari-
able depending on factors such as the structure of the host tissue. Furthermore the pycni-
dia of Phomopsis are not always multilocular, the internal cavity usually being only partly
divided by protrusions of the proliferous layer; this was also the case with the type speci-
men of Plenodomus destruens (see also Harter, |.c.: fig. 1b). The diversity and variation

[@The descriptions of this species by Moesz (I.c.) and Petrak (1.c.) clearly point to a spe-
cies of Phoma, distinguished by nearly globular conidia, mostly 2.5—3 µm diam.; but the
descriptions do not give any indication of the presence of scleroplectenchyma. Petrak's
concept of Plenodomus was mainly based on the general appearance of the pycnidia,
'pleurogenous' origin of the conidia and a connection with the ascomycetous genus
Leptosphaeria. Phoma filarszkyana may indeed be connected with a species of Lepto-
sphaeria sensu lato, because it agrees with the anamorph of L. typhicola P. Karsten, cf.
the cultural study by Lucas & Webster (1967). That Ascomycete is known as a very
variable plurivorous fungus [cf. Leuchtmann (1984) as Massariosphaeria typhicola
(P. Karsten) Leuchtm. and Barr (1989) as Chaetomastia typhicola (P. Karsten) Barr],
recorded on various monocotyledons, esp. marsh plants belonging to the Cyperaceae,
Gramineae, Juncaceae and Typhaceae. However, some of the records probably refer to
another species, because isolates made by Leuchtmann developed a different anamorph
with much larger conidia. The pycnidia of P. filarszkyana in vivo were subglobose-ellip-
soidal with flattened base and a gradually developing ostiolate neck, variable in size, 100—
900 µm diam., wall 40—50 µm, neck mostly 130—150 im long. The pycnidia obtained by

central ostiole; wall composed of an outer layer of brown thick-walled cells and an inner
layer of smaller hyaline cells with undifferentiated conidiogenous cells together with
cylindrical 1—3-septate conidiophores. Conidia 3—4.5 x 1.5 µm, arising apically or just

the characteristics of Cleistophoma dryina as described by Petrak & Sydow (l.c.) from

numerous, mostly densely crowded, semi-globose, closed, with a flattened stromatic
base, very variable in dimensions, often 200-400 µm diam., but also much larger and
often coalescing. The pycnidial cavity has usually a multilocular appearance by the devel-
opment of a central cellular column or irregular folded outgrowth from the basal stroma.
At maturity the upper wall of the pycnidia apparently dehisces or breaks down. Conidia
relatively large, broad ellipsoidal, but soon becoming shriveled; they are borne on short
cylindrical conidiogenous cells lining the loculus. The two species differ only by conidial
size; Oudemans noted 20 x 6—7 µm, whereas those of C. dryina should be shorter, mostly
11-14 x 6-8.5 µm. Petrak & Sydow (l.c.) remark that C. dryina is probably conspecitic

[@Hara's Plenodomus sp. from a fruit spotting disease of apple in Japan, clearly refers to
the above thick-walled Asteromella species, first discovered in the United States on a sim-
ilar apple fruit spot, popularly known as ‘Brooks spot’ (for history sce Anderson, 1956).
Hara's Japanese description of the anamorph may be translated as follows (cf. Dr. Ishii,
l.c.): “Pyenidia initially subepidermal, subglobose, later erumpent, up to 200—300 µm
diam. Wall made up of thick- and thin-walled polygonal cells, 3-6 µm diam. Sporo-
phores tight-packed, filiform, 0.8—1 µm in diameter and up to 20—30 µm long. Spores
ellipsoidal to cylindrical, obtuse at both ends, 2.5—3 x 0.8—1 µm, hyaline." The relatively
large pycnidial dimensions given by Hara probably represent crowded pycnidia in which
the walls may be wanting at the point of contact (compare Brooks & Black, 1l.c.). The
'pyenidiospores' arise from the apices of indistinct filiform columns of cells. They have
never been observed to germinate and probably function as spermatia. The associated
Mycosphaerella species, found on the
surtace of fallen apple leaves (Walton &
Orton, 1926), was originally thought to
be identical with M. pomi (Pass.) Lin-
dau, but was later shown to be distinct
(cf. holotype of Sphaerella pomi Pass.,
PAD: which has significantly broader
ascospores and asci). In culture the fun-
gus produces the hyphomycctous co-
nidial anamorph Pseudocercosporella
pomi, commonly known as Cylindro-
sporium pomi Brooks (Noordeloos &
Boerema, 1988). The latter is also found
on spotted over-ripe apples. Brooks &
Black erroncously identified the pycni-
dial anamorph with Poma pomi Pas-
serini (1888: 96; illegitimate as later

of the synonymy of Plenodomus Preuss with Phomopsis (Sacc.) Sacc. (Von Hóhnel,
1909; recanted by Von Hóhnel in 1918). It concerns a species of Phomopsis which has
been described several times from dead branches and twigs of the white mulberry; see
Uecker (1988). Transfer of Phoma mori Mont. to Phomopsis should result in a later
homonym of the synonym Phomopsis mori Woronichin, Vést. tiflis. bot. Sada 35 (1914)
22. The oldest valid name in the genus Phomopsis appeared to be the Phomopsis moricola
mentioned above, based on Phoma moricola Saccardo, Michelia | (5) (1879) 525. As

[@The description and figures of P. nigricans clearly point to an immature stage of a spe-
cies of Diplodia Fr. [in Montagne, 1834: 302] conformity with Sutton's (1980) concept
of the genus. The mature stage appears to have been described as Diplodia sansevieriae
[H. & P.] Sydow, Annls mycol. 14 (1916) 200. The fungus produces conspicuous dark
brown to black mycelium and black solitary pycnidia, mostly 200—500 µm diam. The
pycnidia are unilocular, globose and thick-walled with a broad outer layer of dark brown
cells and an inner layer of hyaline cells; initially closed, then later develop a central papil-
late pore. Conidiophores short cylindrical, septate, c. 10 µm long and 2-3 µm wide, cach
forming a single apical conidium. Conidia ellipsoidal to oblong-ovoid with a truncate base,
at first hyaline and aseptate, later dark brown and medianly I-septate, (18-)20-26(-28)

Sydow [1937]. He concluded that D. sansevieriae belongs to a plurivorous cosmopolitan
species, which had already been described in Fries's Elenchus Fungorum (1828) from
material collected by Von Schweinitz in the USA (Sphaeria subsolitaria ‘Schwein. in

bosch & van Kesteren (1977) provided evidence that the latter refers to the ubiquitous
soil-borne Phoma glomerata, which frequently occurs on olives in southern Europe. The
present species concept of P. glomerata (sce Contribution II-2 no. 2, Boerema, 1993), is
mainly based on the characteristics in vitro, especially those of the dictyochlamydosporal
alternarioid synanamorph. In vivo dictyochlamydospores are sometimes produced on the
pyenidial wall near the ostiole. The conidia of P. glomerata are highly variable in shape
and dimensions, mostly ovoid-ellipsoidal, 4—8.5 x 1.5-3 µm, usually smaller in vivo

orthoceras refers to Sphaeria orthoceras Fr.: Fr., by Nitschke, (1870: 270) used as ba-
sionym of a Diaporthe-teleomorph found on Achillea species: D. orthoceras (Fr.: Fr.)
Nitschke. The anamorph of the latter should produce a- and B-conidia (Nitschke, l.c.):
'spermatia' fusiform, 8-10 x 2.5 µm; 'stylospores' filiform-hamate, 26 x 1 µm. The a-
conidia type is known as Phoma achillea Saccardo [Michelia 2 (3) (1882) 616; conidia 9—

cover this Phomopsis sp. from Cirsium. However, different host-specific species arc
probably involved because recent studies on the D. arctii-complex have shown that Weh-

The latter generic synonymy was suggested by Von Höhnel in 1909, but afterwards re-
canted. The combination Phomopsis ramealis made by Von Hoéhnel, |.c. in 1916 must be

planata, the type species of Phoma sect. Sclerophomella, sec this paper under Pleno-
domus complanatus, no. 11. It is known that some strains of this common species on
Umbelliferae may produce pycnidia in vivo which have mainly 1-septate conidia, similar
to those of Allescher’s fungus (see Fig. 13B). Therefore we consider both fungi to be
conspecific, which also means that Sclerochaetella should be considered as a synonym of
Phoma sect. Sclerophomella.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This only known species of the genus Paradiscula is fully illustrated and described by
Morgan-Jones (1975). Petrak's initial classification of the fungus in Plenodomus was
based on over-ripe material. The fungus produces eustromatic conidiomata, 200—500 µm
diam. Wall thicker at the base than the sides and above, made up of thin-walled pale
brown cells. Dehiscence by a widely opening longitudinal wall fissure. Conidiogenous
cells lageniform, 5-14 x 2-3.5 µm, formed from the basal and lateral walls. Conidia
oblong-ellipsoidal, 4-6 x 1.5-2 µm. Petrak (1941) noted that this fungus is exceptional
in its tendency to produce abnormal structures; deeply immersed conidiomata may become
very irregular in shape, semi-multilocular and without the common thick basal stroma.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Examination of the above type specimens confirmed Petrak's (l.c.) inference that Spo-

Preuss (l.c.), presently known as Sirococcus conigenus. For the characteristics of this
fungus see Sutton (1980: fig. 371). Thick-walled stromatic conidiomata, uni- or multi-
locular, initially closed, then opened by breakdown of the upper wall. Conidiophores
liliform, branched and septate, up to 50 µm long x 2.5 µm wide, tapering to 1.5 µm.
Conidia (6—)12—15(-16) x (2.5—)3(-3.5) µm, arising from the apices of main and short
lateral branches, fusiform, straight or curved, medianly 1-septate; smaller ones occasion-
ally remaining aseptate. The fungus is found on cones and needles of various conifers
in Eurasia and North America, where it causes Short Blight and Tip Dieback. In phyto-
pathological literature it is commonly named either Ascochyta piniperda Lindau [in Engler
& Prantl, Nat. Pfl. Fam. 1 (1)(1899) 368] or Sirococcus strobilinus Preuss. Von Hóhnel's
interpretation of the fungus as Plenodomus dates from the period when he regarded
Plenodomus Preuss as an older synonym of Phomopsis (Sacc.) Sacc. (Von Höhnel,
1909, synonymy recanted in 1918). He noted that the ‘cartilagenous-gelatinous-plec-
tenchymatous’ Plenodomus strobilinus probably belonged to Diaporthe occulta (Fuckel)
Nitschke. This suggestion, initially adopted by Wehmeyer (1932: 251), was later ques-

[@Descriptions, illustrations, and keys are given of a small part of the 'fructigenus-group' of
the ascomycete genus Hymenoscyphus. The species concerned are characterized by asci orig-
inating from croziers. Hymenoscyphus scutuloides and H. fucatus var. badensis are describ-
ed as new, while the combination H. fucatus is validly published.#Abstract*]

[@The taxonomic core of the genus Hymenoscyphus S.F. Gray is formed by a homoge-
neous group of species which have the same stipitate-cupulate habit, the same excipular
structure, and almost the same shape of asci, ascospores, and paraphyses. This group.
here called ‘fructigenus-group’!, comprises some dozens of lignicolous (incl. fructi-
colous), caulicolous, and foliicolous species, such as H. albidus (P. Karst.) W. Phill.,
H. albopunctus (Peck) Kuntze, H. caudatus (P. Karst.) Dennis, H. fastidiosus (Peck)
Arendholz, the H. fructigenus-complex, H. humuli (Lasch) Dennis, H. salicellus (Fr.:
Fr.) Dennis, H. scutula (Pers.: Fr.) W. Phill., and H. serotinus (Pers.: Fr.) W. Phill.
Their exciple is composed of two layers: the inner layer (medulla) is a thin-walled textura
porrecta, the outer layer (cortex) is a mostly thin-walled textura prismatica. The excipular
hyphae are running parallel with or oriented at a low angle to the excipular surface and
they are not embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Characteristic of the ‘fructigenus-group’ are
the ellipsoid-fusiform to obovoid-fusiform ascospores. Such spores show the upper half
of an ellipsoidal to obovoidal body and the lower half of a fusiform one. The spores are in
general approximately bilaterally symmetrical, owing to an abaxially angulate or even
hooked apex, occasionally combined with some slight curving or single-sided flattening of
the spore. This particular shape is nowadays often indicated as 'scutuloid'?, a term intro-
duced by Baral (in Baral & Krieglsteiner, 1985: 120). As the torpedo shape is providing
for an optimal discharge, some asymmetry causes the spores to rotate round their axis.
This spinning can easily be seen under the microscope, at least in mounts of rehydrated
material in ammonia 1096. Moreover, the spores of several species, e.g. H. salicellus and
H. scutula, are provided at their ends with one or more hyaline, thread-like appendages,
commonly indicated as ‘cilia’ but — because of their immovability and consistency — pref-
erably called ‘setulae’ (bristles). Whether these appendages have a function in spinning, in
attachment to substrata, or in any other process, is unknown (cf. Hawksworth, 1987:
186-187).#Misc-exposition*]

[@!) Also called ‘scutula-stirpe’ (Dennis, 1956: 66, 82; cf. White, 1944: 609, 613) or 'caudatus-group'
(Dumont, 1981: 60), but preferably named 'fructigenus-group' because H. fructigenus (Bull.: Fr.) S.F.

[@As generally known, asci arise at the (provisional) end of ascogenous hyphae, from
2- or 3-celled structures called ‘Dangeardian elements’ (see e.g. Chadefaud, 1943). With-
in the inoperculate ascomycetes two main types of such structures have been found, viz.
the pleurorhynchous type and the aporhynchous type (Berthet, 1964: 98 et seq.). In the
pleurorhynchous type the snout of the elements is laterally turned off over an angle of
about 180°. Hence such elements are hook-shaped and called ‘crozier’ (French ‘crochet
(ascogéne)’, German ‘Haken’, Latin ‘uncus’). In the aporhynchous or (secondarily)
hookless type the forming of a lateral snout is thought to be suppressed, so that the asci
seem to be 'simple-septate' (as called by Huhtinen, 1990: 66-67). When the foremost
binucleate cell or ‘crook’ of a crozier develops into an ascus, the terminal (uninucleate)
cell} may remain visible as a small by-pass arching over the septum between the ascus
and the preceding cell^. A separate term for this small arch seems not to be in common
use, at least in English literature. For that reason several authors have resorted to a cir-
cumscription as ‘Asci originating/produced/arising from croziers’ (e.g. White, 1943;
Dumont, 1976; Korf & Lizon, 1994) or ‘Asci aus Haken entstehend’ (e.g. Arendholz.
1979), without making clear whether the arch remains visible. Some other authors have
misapplied the term 'crozier' to the arch solely (c.g. Dennis, 1956: 76, 79; Haines,
19895), However, a similar process of forming arches is well known from many basi-
diomycetous fungi, viz. in the development of hyphae of the secondary mycelium
(incl. basidia). In these fungi, the anastomosing arch has, for more than a century, been
called ‘clamp-connection’ or, shortly, ‘clamp’ (Fr. ‘boucle’ or ‘anse d'anastomose',
Germ. ‘Schnalle’, Lat. ‘fibula’). Since there is general agreement on the homology of
early development of basidia and asci, and on the homology of clamp forming in basidio-
mycetes and arch forming in ascomycetes (see e.g. Martens, 1932: 261; Moreau, 1950;
Moreau, 1954: 1563; Berthet, 1964: 98, 99, 118; Arx, 1967: 183, 184; Boidin, 1971:
143, 144; Dörfelt, 1989: 47; cf. Gäumann & Dodge, 1928: 421, 422), it seems justified
and — for correct interpretation — advisable to apply the term 'clamp(-connection)' to rele-
vant ascomycetes too. Yet, in several dictionaries the ‘clamp’ is considered as a character
unique to basidiomycetes (c.g. Hawksworth et al., 1983; Dórfelt, 1989). I would, how-
ever, advocate a less exclusive application of this term. Accordingly Moreau & Moreau
(1922) and Berthet (1964: 118) have already used the term ‘boucle’ and von Arx (1967:
69 et seq.) the term ‘Schnalle’ for the ascomycete clamp.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of the ‘fructigenus-group’ contain asci which originate from aporhyn-
chous Dangeardian elements. Hence they lack an anastomosing arch at their base. In this
article attention is paid to three species whose asci arise from pleurorhynchous Dangear-
dian elements, alias croziers, and generally do show a basal anastomosing arch. The pres-
ence of croziers and arches respectively is, indeed, not the only character by which these
three species are distinguished from others. If so, I would not have regarded them as scp-
arate species but as taxa of an infraspecific rank. Such is the case in c.g. Phaeohelotium#Misc-exposition*]

spicuous 'cilium-like processes'. It is noteworthy that these setulae have not been mention-
ed or depicted by Dennis (1956: 79, fig. 69G), who also examined an isotype-collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hymenoscyphus fucatus has originally been found and collected in Shropshire, England,
on dead stems of Polygonum lying in water.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A probable record in 1923 in the Czech Republik can be deduced from Svréek (1985:
159, 188, pl. IX, fig. 4). For, in his revision of the taxa described by Velenovsky in the
genus Helotium, he states that the lectotype collection of Helotium macrosporum Velen.,
found on stems of Cicerbita alpina in Bohemia, is identical with H. scutula var. fucatus.
White (1944: 610—613) collected it in both 1936 and 1938 in the same locality in New
York State, USA, on old stems of Polygonum robustius lying in a swamp. Pallo collected
the species in 1975 on a herbaccous dicotyledon stem in the Western Caucasus, Russia
(Vaasma ct al., 1986: 26). Baral (in Baral & Krieglsteiner, 1985: 128) reported its occur-
rence in 1975 on stems of Solidago sp. in Baden- Württemberg, Germany (no herbarium
material preserved). Blank has found H. fucatus sensu Baral in 1987 on a stem of Sola-
num dulcamare in Thayngen, Switzerland (not preserved; Baral in litt.). Weber (1992:
28, 122) has also examined a Swiss collection of it, found by Baral & Blank in 1990 on a
dicotyledon stem in the canton Graubiinden and determined by Baral (herb. Baral 4193).
As to the last three records it has to be pointed out, however, that H. fucatus sensu Baral
differs from the type in lacking arches at the ascus base (Baral in litt.; Weber, 1992: 121).
Another alleged find was from Germany in 1989 on stems of Aruncus silvester in
Bavaria, but the description and figures of this material show neither croziers or arches
nor setulae (Engel, 1993: 5, 8; Engel & Hanff, 1993: 44).#Misc-exposition*]

light cream-lemon; dise slightly darker than rest.’#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type collection, originally identified as ‘Helotium scutula (Pers. ex Fr.) Karst.’,
has been examined by Dr. K.P. Dumont (New York Botanical Garden) in March 1981,
but was not annotated by him.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As already expressed by its name, H. scutuloides shows a great resemblance to H. scu-
tula. The latter species, however, has larger asci (120-142 x 9-11 gum) which do not
originate from croziers, while its spores are slightly broader (4—5 µm) and usually pos-
sess only one setula at each end. In view of the forementioned resemblance it is quite
possible that H. scutula in the sense of some authors includes H. scutuloides as well.
This seems to be the case in Breitenbach & Krünzlin (1981: 170—171, No. 190). Their
description and figures of H. scutula are mainly based on a collection, found on herba-
ceous stems in the Swiss canton Luzern (compare examined collection!) and probably
representing H. scutuloides. The presence of anastomosing arches at the base of the
asci is not mentioned, but suggested by their fig. 190B. Perhaps H. scutuloides also has
been found by Berthet (1964: 40-41, 101) on dead stems of Solidago canadensis in
France. for the relevant collection of *H. scutula' is described to be of the pleurorhynchous
type.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A related species, also resembling H. scutula and with asci said to be produced from
"tiny" croziers, has been described by Dumont & Carpenter (1982: 582—587, figs. 5, 6)
under the name H. ‘affin. scutulus’. This species, however, found on various substrates
in the neotropics, has obviously pigmented paraphyses and covering hyphae, while its
spores are only 2-3(-4) µm wide, short-setulose at the base and shaped like those of
H. serotinus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@With the understanding that in relevant literature nothing is said about the presence or
absence of croziers, the above description agrees well with the original description by
Phillips (in Phillips & Plowright, 1881: 69) and with the description and figures of an au-
thentic collection of Helotium menthae in herb. Cooke, as given by Dennis (1956: 78, fig.
71E). According to Dennis (1956: 78) the latter material, at the time sent by Phillips to#Misc-exposition*]
[@204 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 2, 1996#Page-header*]

[@Cooke, is ‘evidently the type collection’ but this seems inconsistent with the fact that
Helotium menthae is formally based on Elvellacei britannici 188. At the same place Dennis
has put Helotium (Hymenoscypha) scutula var. menthae '(Phill.) Boud.' into the syn-
onymy of Helotium scutula ‘var. solani Karst. ... 1870".5 I doubt whether this is justi-
fied. Firstly, the asci of var. menthae are up to 90 m long, whereas the ascus of var.
solani, as depicted by Dennis (1956: fig. 71B) from material in herb. Karsten, is more
than 110 µm long. Secondly, the annulus of var. menthae always turns blue in iodine,
whereas var. solani has ‘thecae ... apice iodo non tinctae’ (Karsten, 1870: 234). Atter-
wards Dennis has possibly abandoned the forementioned synonymy, for, in his re-
arrangement of the genus Hymenoscyphus (Dennis, 1964: 73-78) he does mention
H. scutula var. menthae whereas var. solani, whose varietal epithet has priority in case
of synonymy, has been omitted. In my opinion var. solani sensu Karsten is quite similar
to, if not identical with H. consobrinus (Boud.) Hengstm., also because of its “fusoid-
elongate’ spores which are generally uniseptate according to Dennis (1956: fig. 71B).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Assuming that all of the British collections mentioned by Dennis (1956: 78) represent
*var. menthae' sensu stricto, then this taxon has been recorded in Great Britain on stems
of Mentha sativa [2 M. x verticillata], Teucrium scorodonia, Solanum tuberosum, Cani-
panula latifolia and Polygonum sp. (cf. Dennis, 1978: 136). The record on Solanum
tuberosum seems also to have been referred to in Ellis & Ellis (1985: 425—426, pl. 161.
fig. 1672). Kirk & Spooner (1984: 532) have reported on two findings of H. ‘scutulus’
var. solani in 1980 on Urtica dioica and unidentified herbaceous stems on Arran, Scot-
land. Dr. B.M. Spooner (in litt.) has kindly informed me, that ‘the interpretation followed
in the Arran account is that of Dennis (1956), as figured (fig. 71B) from Karsten's mate-
rial’ [of var. solani s.str.!]. He added, that the Arran collection ‘may differ from var.
solani as described by Dennis [p. 78; i.c. var. menthae s.str.!] in having a rather white-
tomentose stipe base [characteristic of H. consobrinus, as already mentioned by Dennis
(1956: 79)] and in being on Urtica.’ All in all, at least the Arran collection seems to show
more resemblance to H. consobrinus than to H. menthae as described in this article.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Baral (in Baral & Krieglsteiner, 1985: 131—132) reported several findings of H. men-
thae in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, viz. on Polygonum cuspidatum and ?piperatum,
Scrophularia nodosa, Lysimachia vulgaris, Lycopus europaeus and Rubus idaeus. Strange-
ly enough, according to Baral (in litt.) H. menthae always has a white hymenium, where-
as Phillips (1887: 137) speaks of a bright yellow disc. In 1914 and 1917 *Helotium
scutula var. menthae’ was found by P. Vogel in Mark Brandenburg, Germany, on stems
of Mentha piperita and has been distributed within two German exsiccata series, viz.
Sydow’s Mycotheca germanica (as No. 1350) and Vogel's Flora der Mark (s.n.) respec-
tively. However, the examined two copies of cach of these exsiccata (L) all represent var.
scutula. Exactly the same misapplication occurs in Petrak's Flora Bohemiae et Moraviae

[@Mentha longifolia (examined specimen: L; cf. Samuels, 1985: 46). It is evident, that Vogel
and Petrak wrongly used the substrate as an essential distinguishing feature. Likewise
Oudemans (1890: 315) at first thought to deal with H. scutula var. menthae when he
examined a Hymenoscyphus found in 1889 on stems of Mentha aquatica in the botanical
garden of Amsterdam. Examination of authentic specimens of var. menthae, however,
gave him certainty that the fungus of Phillips differed from his one, not only by the ab-
sence of cilium-like appendages, but also by the size and shape of the spores and the
quantity of guttules.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From the Netherlands only the three indicated collections could be ascribed to H. men-
thae. Yet Lexamined several collections labelled as Helotium/Hymenoscyphus scutula
var. menthae or var. solani (herb, Swart-Velthuyzen 210, 357; L ex herb. Ernste 937/82,
949/82), but these all belong to H. consobrinus, just like two Belgian collections origi-
nally determined as Helotium scutula var. menthae (herb. Swart-Velthuyzen 272; herb.
Batten 839) and a Belgian collection of *Helotium scutula f. solani’ (BR coll. V. Mouton).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Outside (Western) Europe H. menthae probably only has been recorded under the
name *H. scutula var. solani’ in the sense of Dennis (1956: 78). Ahmad (1978: 207-208)
has collected this taxon in 1953 and 1959 in Pakistan. Thind & Sharma (1980: 128—129,
figs. 3, 4) found it 'growing luxuriantly on Polygonum stems [i.a. P. amplexicaule] in
the North-Western Himalayas’, India. Korf collected it in 1981 on unidentified stems and
on Polygonum cuspidatum in Sichuan, China (Korf & Zhuang, 1985: 500). According to
Lizof (1992: 45), however, the latter collection represents (the typical variety of) H. scu-
tula. Furthermore, Thind & Sharma (1980: 129) mentioned the occurrence of H. 'scutula
var, solani’ in i.a. North America, but without giving any reference although this taxon
has not been listed by Farr et al. (1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type-specimens of the African blackening Lactarius-species, L. melanogalus R. Heim,
L. haliophaeus Pegler and L. griseogalus R. Heim are examined and compared to recent col-
lections from Zaire, Cameroon, Burundi, Zambia and Tanzania. Lactarius denigricans spec.
nov. and L. baliophaeus var. orientalis var. nov. are proposed.#Abstract*]

[@In tropical Africa, some of the Lactarius-species in the section Plinthogali (as defined by
Bon, 1983 and Hesler & Smith, 1979) are characterized by a remarkable colour-change
of the latex and a strong staining of the context. The latex is first watery and transparent,
then turns to grey or even black. The context is cream-coloured and becomes first greyish
pink or greyish red, finally black. In dried condition, those species are easily recognized
by the black colour of the context.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Heim (1955b, 1966, 1967) described two blackening species in the section Plinthogali:
L. melanogalus from Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Gabon and Zaire and L. griseogalus from
Central African Republic. Another blackening Lactarius is described by Pegler (1969) from
Ghana: Lactarius baliophaeus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@This study is based on herbarium material from the National Botanic Garden of Belgium
(BR), the Royal Botanic Garden of Edinburgh (E), the University of Gent (GENT), the
University of Helsinki (H), the Royal Botanic Gardens of Kew (K), the National Muse-
µm of Natural History of Paris (PC) and the personal herbarium of Bart Buyck (BUYCK).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic features are studied in congo-red in ammonia or L4 (Clemengon, 1972)
(eventually after a short passage in KOH 10% solution). Spore ornamentation is described
and illustrated as observed in Melzer's reagent. Terminology of cystidial elements is accord-
ing to Buyck (1991). Line-drawings are made with the aid of a drawing tube at magnifica-
tions 6700 x for spores, 3200 x for individual elements and 1100 x for sections and surface
views. Stippling indicates refractive contents in cystidia and lactifers, intracellular pigmen-
tation in the elements of pilci- and stipitipellis. Basidia length excludes sterigmata length.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Spores are measured in side view in Melzer's reagent, excluding the ornamentation,
and measurements are given as (MINa) [AVa-2*SD]-AVa-AVb-[AVb + 2*SD] (MAXb)
in which AVa = lowest mean value for the measured collections, AVb = greatest mean
value and SD = standard deviation. Q stands for “quotient length/ width’ and is given as
(MINQa) Qa—Qb (MAXQb) in which Qa, resp. Qb, stand for the lowest, respectively the
highest, mean quotient for the measured specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colour-codes are from Kornerup & Wanscher (1978). Colour of spore-prints is ac-
cording to Romagnesi (1967). L + l/cm means number of lamellae (L) and lamellulae (l)
per cm at pileus mid-radius. Names of phytogeographical regions and vegetation types are
according to White (1983).#Misc-exposition*]

[@RESULTS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to the type-specimens, 40 more recent collections have been studied. Most
of those collections could be identified as L. baliophaeus. Some represented L. melano-
galus. When comparing all the collections of L. baliophaeus, it was striking that some of
them had clearly longer spores than the type-specimen. I propose a new variety, L. balio-
phaeus vat. orientalis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Between the Tanzanian collections, gathered by Tiina Saarimiki et al., one blackening
Lactarius that superficially resembles L. baliophaeus, was found. It shows exactly the
same colour-changes, but has totally different microscopic features. The pileipellis con-
sists of thick-walled cylindric elements on a pseudoparenchymatous layer; there are thick-
walled and emergent macropleurocystidia; the ornamentation of the spores is always lower
than 0.5 µm and is composed of warts and fine connective lines. The species is described
as L. denigricans.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lactarius melanogalus, L. griseogalus and L. baliophaeus are typical members of the
section Plinthogali, because of their winged spores and hymeniderm-like pileipellis with-
out thick-walled elements. Though superficially related with those species by the similar
colour-changes, L. denigricans belongs to a different section. The closest affinities with
other African Lactarii are found with Lactarius rubroviolascens R. Heim. The latex of L.
rubroviolascens is water-like, almost translucid with a greyish tinge, the context becomes
blackish, then reddish. Most of the microscopical features are more or less similar to those
of L. denigricans: rather thick-walled elements in pilei- and stipitipellis, macropleurocysti-
dia thick-walled and emergent; spores low ornamented.#Misc-exposition*]

a type-specimen. Heim A87 and Heim Q43! could not be traced at PC. Considering the
water-colour of Heim A87 and the drawings of the spores, they clearly represented the
same species as Goossens-Fontana 979. I propose Goossens-Fontana 979 as lectotypus.
The type-specimen consists of two basidiomes in good condition.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2) The macroscopical description is based on the description of Heim (1955b) and
completed with fieldnotes on Buyck 3332 and/356. The microscopical description is based
on Goossens-Fontana 979, including spore-measurements of Buyck 1356 and 3332.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3) Following the description of Heim, the colour of the pileus is ochraceous to olive-
brown and the illustration of Heim A87 shows indeed a rather pale mushroom. Goossens-
Fontana 979 is mentioned (Heim, 19552) to be dark brown (bistre sombre), which is also
the colour of the specimens of Buyck and Watling. The water-colour of Heim A87, which
shows a very young specimen, proves that the pileus is ochraceous when young and be-
comes darker with age.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4) The taste of latex and context is very acrid in the specimens collected by Heim, very
bitter in Goossens-Fontana 979, very acrid (but slow) in Buyck 3332, mild in Buyck
1356. There is a strong and sweetish smell in Buyck 1356, a fish-smell in Heim Q43 and
a smell of Russula pectinata (Foetentinae) in Heim A87.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5) The presence of aberrant spores is mentioned by Heim (1955b, fig. 15). Those spores
can have the same size as the normal spores, but they have strongly amyloid droplet-like.
globose warts, very irregular in size and number, and there is no sign of the normal retic-
ulate ornamentation at all. I observed such spores in Goossens-Fontana 979 and in the
specimens of Cameroon, but they are certainly not characteristic for this species. Similar
deviant spores were observed in collections of other African Lactarius- and Russula-spe-
cies (Buyck, personal comment). An explication for their existence is unknown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because the type-specimen (1 basidiome) is in very bad condition and no other speci-
mens of this species are known yet, no complete description can be given here. Before he
gave a Latin diagnosis in 1967, Heim described the species extensively in 1966. Accord-
ing to Heim, this species is very closely related to L. melanogalus, but differs from it by
the very dark brown pilcus and a very pronounced papilla. The latex becomes greyish, but#Misc-exposition*]



[@1) There exists another specimen labeled Heim Q43, which represents Lactarius gymnocarpus. As there is
no confusion possible between those species and as Heim cited Heim Q43 also under L. gymnocarpus.
I suppose that there were two specimens with the same number. Despite a long search, this Heim Q43
could not be traced in the National Museum of Natural History of Paris.#Misc-exposition*]

[@never black and the taste is mild and sometimes a bit astringent. He also mentions that the
spores are smaller. As in the present concept of L. melanogalus the pileus becomes darker
with age and the taste of the context and latex appears rather variable, the noted differences
are of low significance. Although the type is in very poor condition, it was possible to
take a careful look at the spores. They proved to be very different indeed from those of
L. melanogalus. The spores are ellipsoid and measure 7.0-8.2—9.3 x 5.5-6.0-6.5 µm
(Q = 1.24-1.36-1.55; n = 20). The winged aspect of the ornamentation of the spores is
not as obvious as in L. melanogalus. The ornamentation is up to 1.5 µm high. Beside the
normal 4-spored basidia, 2-spored basidia were frequently observed. For these reasons
L. griseogalus is nevertheless considered as a good species.#Misc-exposition*]

tocybeae. Taxonomic and nomenclatural comments on some other taxa are added.#Abstract*]

[@XXIV. A NOMENCLATURAL NOTE ON ARMILLARIA TABESCENS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name of this species is cited as Armillaria tabescens (Scop.: Fr.) Dennis et al. (Ter-
morshuizen, 1995). However, this is double incorrect. First, the name Agaricus tabescens
has never been sanctioned by Fries. Second, the combination in Armillaria has to be attrib-
uted to Emel (1921), as already noted by Dennis et al. (1960: 18) who were unable to
confirm this combination.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Emel (1921: 50) in a dissertation that was probably not very widely distributed, in-
troduced the combination Armillaria tabescens. The title of his dissertation (Le genre
Armillaria, Fr. sa suppression de la systématique botanique), and remarks in the text
(p. 75) that the genus Armillaria does not possess enough constant characters to be main-
tained, suggest that Emel did not accept the genus. Under Art. 34.1. (Greuter et al., 1994)
the name would therefore be invalid. However, Emel’s remarks are better interpreted that
he just considered the Friesian taxon Armillaria as unnatural (a view universally accepted
nowadays) and that he proposed the species of that genus to be placed in other genera.
However, as Art. 34.1. only refers to anticipation of future acceptance of a taxon, and not
to anticipation of future rejection of a taxon, and as Emel explicitly listed the combination
A. tabescens (Scop.) Emel, I consider the name as validly published.#Misc-exposition*]

[@XXV. TAXONOMIC AND NOMENCLATURAL NOTES ON CLITOCYBE#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clitocybe brumalis (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is a curious phenomenon in mycology that some fungal names persist for a long
time even though the taxon, for which the name is used, might get very different inter-
pretations. I would consider such names as names of ghost species. The genus Clitocybe
is probably fairly rich in such ghost species and C. brumalis (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm. makes a
good chance for being the most famous one.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus brumalis (Fries, 1818: 206-208) was described with a greyish pileus and la-
mellae, and long, concolorous stipe. Citation of the illustration of A. cinerascens Batsch#Misc-exposition*]

[@and Fries’s comment that A. brumalis was very much related to A. tardus (= Pseudoclito-
cybe cyathiformis (Bull.: Fr.) Sing.) do not leave much doubt that the original A. bruma-
lis belongs to the genus Pseudoclitocybe. The sanctioning description (Fries, 1821: 171)
is essentially the same, except for the addition that it is odourless.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1838: 76) must be held responsible for the first different interpretation, by stat-
ing that the stipe is white and the lamellae pallid. The pileus colour was not mentioned in
his vague description. It was said to be odourless (and by implication probably without
taste). Such a vague description did form a good possibility for later confusion. Kühner
& Romagnesi (1953) described C. brumalis as a species with a cream-coloured pilcus
with brown centre (although Fries described the pileus as unicolorous) and weak farina-
ceous smell (although odourless according to Fries). This description fits rather well for
C. marginella Harm. (except for the weak farinaccous smell) and the large majority of
collections filed under C. brumalis in Dutch herbaria did indeed represent C. marginella.
Lange (1935) interpreted C. brumalis as a much darker species with small spores and a
strigose stipe basis. It could represent C. lohjaensis Harm., a species unknown from the
Netherlands. Bresadola (1927) noted a conspicuous smell and bitter taste for C. brumalis
and his description very strongly suggest C. phaeophthalma (Pers.) Kuyp., a species
otherwise lacking in Bresadola's work although it is not uncommon near Trento. Henry
(1983) described C. brumalis as a large-spored species; his description would well fit
C. metachroa (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm. With — at least — six different interpretations available
and a protologue and sanctioning description that make it extremely likely that C. brumalis
is not a Clitocybe at all, I cannot but reject this name as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clitocybe dealbata (Sow.: Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Separation of C. dealbata and C. rivulosa (Pers.: Fr.) Kumm. has been considered as
very difficult. The characters usually considered as sufficient for separating two taxa on
species level, viz. general habit, pileus form, and colour of the pileus were found to show
intergradations in Dutch collections. Herbarium collections in several Dutch herbaria filed
under C. dealbata were found to consist of young specimens of C. rivulosa.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Harmaja (1969: 75) adopted only the name C. dealbata and nowhere discussed the
name C. rivulosa, the latter name without arguments just being declared a nomen dubium.
Harmaja did not provide a macroscopical description of C. dealbata, implying that he did
not sce fresh material of it himself, but as he included a collection from Lundell & Nann-
feldt (1938) under the name C. rivulosa, I have no doubts about the identity of Harmaja's
species. An earlier collection distributed as C. dealbata (Lundell & Nannfeldt, 1936), was
identified as C. candicans (Pers.: Fr.) Kumm. by Harmaja. Lamoure (1983) concluded,
on the basis of interfertility experiments that C. dealbata and C. rivulosa had to be consid-
ered conspecific. She also choose the name C. dealbata for it.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The application of the name C. dealbata is, however, beset with some difficulties. Aga-
ricus dealbatus, as illustrated by Sowerby (1799), depicts a small hygrophanous white
mushroom with a convex to infundibuliform pileus, growing under a canopy of firs. Al-
though it cannot be excluded that Sowerby illustrated slender specimens of a Clitocybe
(e.g. C. candicans (Pers.: Fr.) Kumm.), his figure is more strongly reminiscent of Hemi-
mycena lactea (Pers.: Fr.) Sing. Fries (1821: 92) sanctioned the name C. dealbatus, but
his listing of Sowerby's taxon as a separate variant, different from Fries's main interpre-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Kuyper: Norulae ad floram agaricinam — XXIV-XXVIIT 227#Page-header*]

[@tation of A. dealbatus seems to suggest that Fries was in doubt whether his taxon was
identical with Sowerby's.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Later interpretations (Kühner & Romagnesi, 1953) of the name C. dealbata included
not only C. rivulosa but also a closely related species with a farinaceous smell (a character
not mentioned by Sowerby; Fries explicitly stated that the species was inodorous). This
latter taxon is better known as C. augeana (Mont.) Sacc.(syn.C. ruderalis Harm.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the name C. rivulosa is of unambiguous application, it has been accepted by me
(Kuyper, 1995: 48). The name C. dealbata is best rejected as a nomen dubium, as none
of the interpretations that have been in use correspond to Sowerby’s taxon.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although C. rivulosa is generally regarded as a grassland species, it can grow in for-
ests as well. Records of muscarine poisoning by C. phyllophila (Pers.: Fr.) Kumm. or
C. candicans refer to C. rivulosa as the two other species do not contain muscarine (Stijve
& Kuyper, unpublished).#Misc-exposition*]

[@It has been customary to treat this name as a younger synonym for C. gibba (Pers.:
Fr.) Kumm. However, this is certainly incorrect. Agaricus infundibuliformis, as de-
scribed and illustrated by Schaeffer (1774) has a red-brown pileus with paler and dark-
er spots, and yellowish lamellae. It is Lepista flaccida (Sow.: Fr.) Pat. The epithet in-
fundibuliformis is apparently quite obvious for a funnel-shaped agaric, and at least
7 different homonymous A. infundibuliformis have been described, viz. A. infundi-
buliformis Scop. 1772 (2 Cantharellus tubaeformis Fr.: Fr.), A. infundibuliformis

Agaricus fimbriatus Bolt.: Fr., a pleurotoid taxon coming close to Ossicaulis lignatilis
(Pers.: Fr.) Redh. & Ginns).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clitocybe langei Hora#Misc-exposition*]

[@The application of this name has also been beset with many difficulties, already arising
from the fact that Fries in his first mycological publications might not have had a clear con-#Misc-exposition*]
[@228 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 2, 1996#Page-header*]

[@ception of C. vibecina (Fr.) Quél. and C. metachroa (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm., as nowadays
understood, and therefore might have confused them (Harmaja 1969: 97). He might even
have considered them as synonyms (Fries 1821: 172). Clitocybe vibecina nowadays is
understood as a species with a farinaceous smell, but this was not mentioned by Fries
(1818). Only later (Fries, 1838) did Fries remark that an (unnamed) subspecies of it pos-
sessed a weak farinaceous smell.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is therefore not surprising that later authors used the name C. vibecina for what is
now called C. metachroa (Bresadola, 1928: pl. 179; Konrad & Maublanc, 1925: pl. 295).
The concept of C. vibecina by Lange (1930), who separated it from C. metachroa because
of farinaceous smell, smaller spores, darker lamellae und unicolorous stipe, was therefore
deviating from several of the important mycological publications at that time. It is also not
very surprising that Singer (1943) proposed a new name for C. vibecina sensu J. Lange,
viz. C. langei [nomen invalidum, Latin diagnosis lacking]. Unfortunately, Singer remain-
ed silent on the identity of C. vibecina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The subsequent fate of the name C. langei has been like that of a ghost species. Favre
(1948) described both C. vibecina and C. langei (still invalid) and separated the latter spe-
cies on account of more brownish pileus and smaller lacrymoid spores (5.0—6.5 x 2.7-
3.2 µm; C. vibecina was said to have ellipsoid spores, measuring 5.5-7.0 x 3.5-4.0
µm). No recent collections of Favre's taxon are known. However, as Lange (1930) de-
scribed elliptical spores for C. vibecina, we must conclude that C. langei Singer and
C. langei sensu Favre refer to different species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hora (1960: 441) validly described C. langei. His description notes lacrymoid spores
measuring 5.0—6.0 x 2.7-3.2 µm. Hora also remarked that C. /angei in Britain is more
common than C. vibecina. Unfortunately, Hora's type collections have been lost and the
identity of the type can therefore never be established. However, his remark that C. langei
is in Britain even more common than C. vibecina, leads to the conjecture that C. Jangei
Hora is merely a brownish variant of C. vibecina without formal taxonomic status (despite
differences in spore size and form), as all collections in K and E named C. /angei did in-
deed belong to C. vibecina. Clitocybe langei sensu Harmaja (1969: 104—105) is enig-
matic; one cannot escape the feeling that he felt unable to really separate both species and
therefore even suggested hybridisation between C. langei and C. vibecina as intermedi-
aries were also found. This also leads to the conjecture that it too is merely a variant of
C. vibecina.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For these reasons, C. langei is treated as a synonym of C. vibecina (Kuyper 1995: 56).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clitocybe maxima (Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In conjunction with the name C. geotropa (DC. & Lam.) Quél., the name C. maxima
has repeatedly been used by mycologists to denote a closely related taxon. That taxon
was said to differ from C. geotropa in being larger, lacking an umbo, having a shorter
stipe, and in possessing more ellipsoid spores. However, two different interpretations
of the name C. maxima have been in use, none of which corresponds to Agaricus maxi-
mus Gärtner, Meyer & Scherbius. One interpretation of C. maxima refers to a variant of
C. geotropa, where the supposed differences (size, pileus form, ratio of pileus diameter
and stipe length) between both taxa are without a genetic basis (Nüesch, 1926: 122). The
other interpretation refers to an autonomous species, which is closely related to C. geotropa,#Misc-exposition*]
[@Kuyper: Notulae ad floram agaricinam — XXIV-XXVIII 229#Page-header*]

[@but differs in having ellipsoid spores (6.5—9.5(—11.0) x 4.5—6.0(-7.0) µm; C. geotropa
has subglobose to broadly ellipsoid spores measuring (7.0-)7.5-9.5(-10.0) x 6.0-7.0
µm). The correct name for this taxon is C. gigas Harm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Both interpretations of C. maxima contradict the protologue. Agaricus maximus Gürt-
ner et al. was a superfluous name for A. giganteus Leyss. and A. infundibuliformis
Hoffm. (itself also superfluous for A. giganteus Leyss.). Their description is also in
agreement with Leucopaxillus giganteus. Fries (1821: 80) clearly recognized this fact,
by listing A. maximus as a synonym of A. giganteus, keeping it clearly separate from
A. geotropus, considered as a large form of A. gibbus. However, Fries (1825: 10—13)
came to doubt his earlier taxonomic judgements and referred part of A. giganteus and
A. maximus to infraspecific status under A. gibbus. The ‘true’ A. giganteus as a separate
species remained unknown to Fries at that time. By excluding the obligatory type of
A. maximus when Fries redescribed A. gibbus var. maximus, he is considered to have
created a new taxon that must be attributed to Fries solely.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the name Agaricus maximus has been used for at least three different species, it is
best rejected as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Clitocybe metachroa (Fr.: Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]

Z.. Pilzk. 47: 138. 1969 (basionym).#Nomenclature*]

[@Many authors have tried to separate C. metachroa and a closely related taxon called
C. dicolor (Pers.) Murrill. From a nomenclatural point of view such a separation seems
unfounded, as Agaricus metachrous Fr.: Fr. (1821: 172) was proposed as a renaming for
A. dicolor. This was stated explicitly by Fries (1830) as "Agaricus dicolor 2 A. metachrous
S. M.; nomen dicolor, et radice hybridum et per se minus aptum est."#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several authors might, however, have had a broad concept of C. metachroa including
the closely related C. amarescens Harm. and C. metachroides Harm. The latter species
comes very close to C. metachroa but differs in having somewhat darker colours, slightly
smaller spores and distinctly incrusting pigments in pileipellis and upper pileitrama. Dutch
collections of this species are also somewhat more tough than C. metachroa and hardly
translucent striate, although Finnish material is striate (Harmaja, 1969). Clitocybe meta-
chroides has only recently been recognized in the Netherlands and it is probably not un-
common.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There seem to have been no earlier reports of such a non blue-green variety of C. odora,

have almost completely faded (Nüesch, 1926). Another possibility is that var. fallax,
when found, would be referred to the enigmatic C. subalutacea (Batsch: Fr.) Kumm.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The identity of Agaricus subalutaceus has remained doubtful. The original description
by Batsch (1789) refers to a whitish species for which no smell was indicated. In my opin-
ion Batsch's illustration depicts C. pAyllophila (Pers.: Fr.) Kumm. Fries (1818: 138) in
his first description did also not mention a smell of aniseed. In the sanctioning description
Fries (1821: 90) noted that some variants have a smell of aniseed. However, Fries did not
compare this species to A. odorus, although he in the same publication pointed out the
very close relationship between A. odorus and A, suaveolens as interpreted by him (actu-
ally C. odora var. alba J, Lange). It seems possible that Fries’s sanctioning description re-
fers to either C. albofragrans (Harm.) Kuyp. or to C. phyllophila var. tenuis Harm.#Misc-exposition*]

thereby augmenting uncertainty about the application of the name. Ricken (1914: 370)
described C. subalutacea as a pale species with a weak smell of aniseed and with small
spores (3-4 x 3 µm). Nüesch (1926: 148—151) described C. subalutacea on the basis of
one collection and indicated somewhat larger spores (3-6 x 3—4 µm). Both descriptions
seem to refer to C. albofragrans. Niiesch also made clear that pale variants of C. odora
could be confused with C. subalutacea, but that C. odora has decidedly larger spores.
Clitocybe subalutacea sensu Bigelow (1982: 116) is also small-spored and with a weak
smell of aniseed. It too might come close to C. albofragrans, a species unknown to Bige-
low.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Lange (1930: 45-46) described a species which he called C. subalutacea Batsch?
(thereby indicating doubts about the application of the specific epithet), which was char-
acterized by a smell of Marasmius oreades (cyanidic smell). As noted by him, his taxon
might well be in need of another name.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kühner & Romagnesi (1953: 137) accepted C. subalutacea in Ricken's interpretation,
but noted that they never saw this species themselves. They also introduced a new spe-
cies, viz. Clitocybe sericella [nomen invalidum, às a Latin diagnosis was lacking] for
which C. subalutacea sensu J. Lange was given as a synonym. This species was said to
have a distinct cyanidic smell. In a later publication Romagnesi (in Kühner & Romagnesi,
1956: 119—120) proposed the name C. subsericella [nomen invalidum, because alternative
names were proposed] and indicated large cylindrical spores (7.2—9.0 x 3.7—4.0; earlier
they were given as 6 x 4 µm) and the absence of clamp-connections, making it rather un-
likely that his species is identical with Lange's. Interestingly, Métrod (1946) introduced
the new name C. rufuloalutacea [nomen invalidum, as a Latin diagnosis was lacking]
which was suggested to be the same as C. subalutacea sensu Ricken and C. subalutacea
sensu J. Lange; but spores were indicated as 4—5 x 3.2—3.7 µm!#Misc-exposition*]

[@A taxon very similar to Lange's species was reported from the Netherlands by me
(Kuyper, 1995: 51) as C. subalutacea sensu J. Lange; it is here formally described as
C. frysica.#Misc-exposition*]

[@As the name C. subalutacea has been applied for at least five different taxa (viz. C. phyl-
lophila, C. albofragrans; C. odora var. fallax; C. subsericella; C. frysica), it seems best to
reject this name as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@THE IDENTITY OF AGARICUS CYATHIFORMIS SCHAEFF.#Misc-exposition*]

[@F. KOTLABA! & Z. POUZAR?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The problem of the correct interpretation of the original concept of Lentinus cyathiformis
(Schaeff.) Bres. = Agaricus cyathiformis Schaeff. is analysed. The authors demonstrate, on
the basis of the original protologue, that this species is identical with Pleurotus pulmo-
narius (Fr.) Quél. The modern interpretation of Lentinus cyathiformis, originating from
Bresadola and followed by a number of contemporary authors, is erroncous: this fungus
should be called Lentinus degener Kalchbr. in Fr.#Abstract*]

[@A conspicuous wood-inhabiting gill fungus, sporadically distributed in riverside forests of
the southern part of Central Europe and evidently also in Southern and Western Europe, is
known in the contemporary mycological literature under three different names. One of
them is Lentinus degener Kalchbr. in Fr., the second, just recently applied, is L. schaefferi
(Weinm.) Rausch., but the most frequent is the third name, L. cyathiformis (Schaeff.)
Bres. The interpretation of the last two names is quite erroncous in modern mycological
literature.#Misc-exposition*]

[@About 27 years ago (Kotlaba & Pouzar, 1967) we attempted to elucidate the identity of
the name Agaricus cyathiformis Schaeffer (1774) because, in our opinion, it represents a
fungus quite different from Lentinus degener. On the basis of Schaeffer's picture only
(Tab. CCLII in Icones fungorum, 1771), without taking into account the description, we
reached the conclusion that it most likely represents Panus torulosus (Pers.: Fr.) Fr. =
Pleurotus conchatus (Bull.: Fr.) Pilát, since the lamellae of the fungus on Schaeffer's
plate are very broad and as such in contrast to the context of the pileus, which is relatively
thin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We recently restudied Schaeffer' s picture (Tab. CCLII), together with the description
(p. 66—67), and reached the new conclusion that Schaeffer's fungus is almost certainly
identical with Pleurotus pulmonarius (Fr.) Quél. The reasons for this new interpretation are
as follows: the description asserts that the pileus is yellow (‘pileo luteo’), the surface is
punctate-striate (*punctato-striatus") and the stipe is also pale yellow (*pallide luteo’). How-
ever, in the copy of Schaeffer's book in the National Museum, Prague, it is darker and
rather brown.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It is worth to explain why Schaeffer's fungus could be in no way identical with the
fungus with which it is still continually identified (see e.g. Boekhout, 1990; Moser, 1983;
Pegler, 1983; Rauschert, 1988; Kreisel, 1987, 1992). This interpretation originates from
Bresadola (1900), who misinterpreted Schaeffer's fungus. The reasons why Schaeffer's
fungus cannot be identified with Lentinus degener = L. cyathiformis sensu Bresadola are
as follows.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Kotlaba & Pouzar: Agaricus cyathiformis 235#Page-header*]

[@The edge of the lamellae of Agaricus cyathiformis in the work of Schaeffer is depict-
ed as being entire, and fits therefore well with Pleurotus pulmonarius, whereas the edge
clearly is denticulate (serrate) in L. degener. It should also be compared with the plate of
Agaricus tubaeformis Schaeff. (= Lentinus lepideus) on plate CCLIX of Schaeffer's book,
where the lamella edge is depicted as clearly denticulate. Both pictures were made by the
same painter (Loibl), and this proofs that Schaeffer paid attention to the precise drawing
of the lamella edge.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The lamellae of Lentinus cyathiformis sensu Bresadola are thinner in the middle part
of the pileus than the context of the pileus in Bresadola (Fungi tridentini, plate 206) (the
margin of the pileus cannot be taken into consideration). This is quite different in Schaeffer's
Agaricus eyathiformis where the lamellae are at least two times broader than the context of
the pileus, and so this character also fits well with Pleurotus pulmonarius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@- The fungus of Schaeffer's plate CCLII is evidently of a rather thin nature, which fits
also well with Pleurotus pulmonarius (Panus torulosus is also similar). Fruit-bodies of
Lentinus degener have usually much thicker context, especially young specimens, and
therefore they have quite another appearance. The ratio of the breath of the lamellae to the
thickness of the context of the pileus is in fact opposite in Lentinus degener compared
with Pleurotus pulmonarius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@— We interpret the dark colour of the stipe in the picture of Agaricus cyathiformis by
Schaeffer as a shadow, made by the painter, since Schaeffer described the stipe as 'pallide
luteo" (*von mittlerer Farbe"), which in no way is brown. In Lentinus degener the stipe
becomes more or less brown rather carly (see the picture of the younger specimens in
Bresadola's plate 206), while in Pleurotus pulmonarius the stipe is white and becomes
yellowish to ochraceous in old specimens only.#Misc-exposition*]

[@- According to our experience and photographs young specimens of Lentinus degener
and Pleurotus pulmonarius are quite different, however, in older specimens the surface of
the pileus is rather similar in both species, with a somewhat fibrillose to shortly striate mar-
gin. The striate appearance of the whole pileus of Agaricus cyathiformis on Schaeffer's plate
CCLII, however, is in no doubt the result of the painter's stylization or better to say his
artistic utterance which he (Loibl) used in the same book also in pictures of other fungi
with a more or less smooth pileus. Good examples arc c. g. Tab. XLIX, fig. 1, VI of
Agaricus lateritius (= Hypholoma lateritium), Tab. CIX of Boletus aurantius (= Albatrellus
confluens) or Tab. CCXIV, fig. II, III of Agaricus xerampelinus (7 Russula xerampelina).#Misc-exposition*]

[@- Lentinus degener and Pleurotus pulmonarius occur not only on wood of broad-leaved
trees, but rarely also on coniferous wood. Lentinus degener grows in Mediterranean re-
gions sometimes on conifers. Schaeffer's Agaricus cyathiformis, a species described from
Central Europe (Bavaria) originally was indicated as collected "In silvis abiegnis ... ad
radices et truncos ..." or "In Tannenwüldern ..." However, in the territory of the former
Czechoslovakia and elsewhere in Central Europe we found Lentinus degener never on
coniferous wood. On the other hand we have several records of Pleurotus pulmonarius on
conifers, including Abies alba.#Misc-exposition*]

[@— Bresadola was unsuccessful also in the interpretation of some other older names of
fungi, as e.g. Agaricus fuliginosus Fr., which in fact is Lactarius picinus Fr., but not
L. fuliginosus (Fr.) Fr., or Russula sardonia Fr., which in Bresadola's interpretation
represents R. luteotacta Rea. Later mycologists evidently did not pay attention to the orig-
inal concept of Agaricus cyathiformis Schaeff., and simply followed Bresadola.#Misc-exposition*]

[@From all these reasons, it is impossible to accept the conspecifity of Agaricus cya-
thiformis Schaeff. with Lentinus degener Kalchbr. in Fr. In our experience of some forty
years we came across numerous fruit-bodies of Lentinus degener in Czechoslovak river-
side forests, we know the fungus rather well and can therefore judge this problem on the
basis of a well founded knowledge of this fungus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The name Lentinus schaefferi (Weinm.) Rauschert, which nowadays is sometimes
used for L. cyathiformis, is based on Agaricus schaefferi Weinm. (1836). This is merely
a new name for Agaricus cyathiformis Schaeff. non Agaricus cyathiformis Bull.: Fr.
(= Pseudoclitocybe cyathiformis (Bull.: Fr.) Sing.) and therefore must be typified with
the same iconotype as A. cyathiformis Schacft. Weinmann correctly interpreted Schaeffer's
fungus, because his description relates to Pleurotus pulmonarius: beside similar morpho-
logical features he also refers to Betula alba (= B. pendula) as host, one of the many host
trees of P. pulmonarius, but never for L. degener. So, nomenclaturally speaking, the
name Lentinus schaefferi (Weinm.) Rauschert relates to Pleurotus pulmonarius, and in no
way to Lentinus degener Kalchbr. in Fr.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pegler (1983) cites, as another synonym of our fungus, Panus urnula Fr. *185V (the
last pages with the description of this fungus in Monographia Hymenomycetum Sue-
ciae were, however, published in 1863) which is seemingly older than Lentinus degener
Kalchbr. in Fr. 1874. However, when analysing the description of Panus urnula Fr., we
reached the conclusion that it could in no way be Lentinus degener: The fruit-body is
described as ‘imbricato-multiplex et concrescens’, a character which does not apply in
L. degener. Also the gills are described as ‘integerrimae, griseae’, whereas in L. degener,
the gills are denticulate (at least in some places) and never grey. Panus urnula Fr. may
therefore represent Pleurotus pulmonarius (Fr.) Quél. as well. Pegler (1983) cited a fur-
ther apparently older synonym of L. degener, i.c. Panus schurii Schulzer 1844, but this is
a misprint: the date should be correctly cited as 1884. Judging from the description of that
species, it is most likely not identical with Lentinus degener.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We conclude that the correct name for the species of the gill fungus which is often called
Lentinus cyathiformis (Schaeff.) Bres. or L. schaefferi (Weinm.) Rausch. must be, with-
out questioning, Lentinus degener Kalchbr. in Fries 1874 as there is no doubt as regard
the interpretation of its original concept.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Italian authors Tomei & Monti (1979) presented quite a new taxonomic concept of
Lentinus degener, stating that there are, in fact, two different species which they call
L. cyathiformis and L. degener respectively. The differences are to be found in the shape
of the carpophore, the configuration of the hymenophore and the size of spores. This
problem should be thoroughly studied — we are unable to confirm the existence of two
species — but, nomenclaturally, the name L. cyathiformis can in no way be applied to any
of the taxa involved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Psilocybe puberula is a very distinct species because of the dry, not gelatinized pilei-
pellis with pileocystidioid elements, the rather thick-walled spores, which are sometimes
almost lentiform in frontal view, and the slight, but distinct bluing of the stipe and rarely
also the pileus. Psilocybe turficola differs among other things by having larger spores,
and sphagnicolous habitat. Psilocybe sabulosa Peck has a well-developed veil, larger
spores (12—18.5 µm long), and differently shaped cheilocystidia. Both species lack pilco-
cystidia. If one takes into consideration the slight bluing of the pileus in some specimens,
sections Semilanceatae and Cyanescens also must be checked on similar taxa. Psilocybe
puberula has some resemblance indeed with P. strictipes and P. semilanceata, which dif-
fer, however, by their distinctly gelatinized pileipellis without pileocystidia or pileocys-
tidioid elements. Psilocybe puberula is not related to P. cyanescens, which always shows
a very strong bluing, and has a very different, gelatinized pileipellis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@^ misjudgment of the significance of the thick, radiating hairs at the base of the stipe
coupled with the fragility of the latter, and some other characters, first induced me to
place this taxon in section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél., among the clampless species (Maas
Geesteranus, 1988: 46, Key 3). After reading a draft of the present work, Dr. R.A. Maas
Geesteranus, whom I thank wholeheartedly both for confirming that the species was as
yet undescribed and for his valuable suggestions, informed me that the new taxon fitted in
perfectly with section /nsignes Maas G. which at the moment included five American and
two European species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Section Insignes Maas G. includes species having, among other characters, 4-spored
basidia (only one is 2-spored), pileus and stipe hyphae embedded in a gelatinous layer and
clamps. generally growing on pine needles on the ground. On the contrary, the possible
presence of plentiful and noticeable fibrils, either radiatingly disposed or forming more or
less thick mats at stipe base appears to have uncertain diagnostic value: "generally covered
with fibrils at the base" (Maas Geesteranus, 1989: 343—344). The spore size of Mycena
calceata, much larger than those of the other 4-spored species of the section, is a major
character. As a matter of fact, it is well known that spore size in a 2-spored form is always
larger than that of a 4-spored form. Only the spore size of Mycena corrugans Maas G.
is much larger than that of Mycena calceata, but only because the former is 2-spored (or
rarely 3-spored). Also the thick radiating hairs at the base of the not radiating stipe is an
uncommon character for the species now included in the section, being this character de-
scribed only for Mycena roriduliformis (Murrill) Dennis “unite to form comparatively
few, coarse, stiff, radiating strands” and for Mycena mitis Maas G. “basi fibrillis radian-
tibus albis substrato affixus" (Maas Geesteranus, 1992: 469). In addition Mycena mitis
and Mycena corrugans grow on Quercus leaves on the ground and at the base or on roots
of Calamagrostis epigeios respectively, while Mycena calceata grows on thin branches or
twigs of Quercus suber on the ground. All these species grow under broad-leaf trees, by
contrast all the American species of section /nsignes were collected under conifers. Finally
Mycena calceata is the first clampless species of the section.#Misc-exposition*]

[@TYPIFICATION OF
VOLVARIELLA GLOIOCEPHALA (DC.: FR.) BOEKHOUT & ENDERLE#Misc-exposition*]

[@TEUN BOEKHOUT! & MANFRED ENDERLE?#Misc-exposition*]

[@A neotype is designated for Volvariella gloiocephala (DC.: Fr.) Bockhout & Enderle, to
serve as an representative collection for the current concept of this species, that generally is
considered conspecific with V. speciosa (Fr.: Fr.) Kummer.#Abstract*]

[@Authentic material of many species of agarics described in the nineteenth century or before
is not preserved. This has led to many controversies about the interpretation of species
names in agaricology. Designation of a lectotype, paratype, neotype or epitype contributes
to taxonomic and nomenclatural stability (Greuter et al., 1994, Art. 9.2, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7).
However, the selection of lecto-, para-, neo- or epitypes may be complicated (see e.g.
Fell et al., 1989; Kuyper & Vesterholt, 1990; Guého et al., 1992; Rodrigues de Miranda
& Batenburg-van der Vegte, 1981).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Many early descriptions of agarics are short, e.g. that of Amanita speciosa Fr. (Fries,
1818). and lack information on taxonomically important characters. Therefore, unam-
biguous interpretations may not always be possible. In principle, careful comparison of
descriptions of the same species given by subsequent authors may help to understand the
(changes in) historical concepts of the species concerned, which are the basis of currently
used taxonomic concepts. When a species description can only be interpreted equivocally,
and no authentic material fitting the protologue is present, most taxonomists tend to reject
these names (see e.g. Kosonen, 1993). Every now and then, mycologists try to interpret
old and hardly interpretable names, e.g. Agaricus phaepodius Bull.: Fr. (Singer & Clé-
mengon, 1972), Agaricus humilis Persoon (Métrod, 1948), Agaricus fastibilis Pers.: Fr.
(Kuyper & Vesterholt, 1990). As a result, conflicting interpretations of these species
exist, or a name is used for different species as in the case of Agaricus melaleucus Pers.
(Kühner, 1978; Maire, 1916).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The recently adopted ‘Tokyo Code’ provides for epitypes, or interpretative types in
cases where the holotype, lectotype, neotype or all original material is demonstrable am-
biguous and cannot be critically identified for purposes of the precise application of the
name of a taxon. It is the authors’ opinion that nomenclatural and taxonomic stability can
only be achieved if the interpretation of old species names is accompanied by the desig-
nation of lecto-, para-, neo- or epitypes. If possible pure cultures, made from recently
collected neo- or epitype specimens, should be deposited in public culture collections.
Once such a typification is settled, future workers must stick to it, unless the typification
seriously conflicts with the protologue (ICBN, Art. 9.13). However, in cases of great

[@confusion it is useful to regard the original diagnosis non-interpretable, reject the name,
and describe a new species. Undesired nomenclatural changes can now be circumvented
by the widely expanded possibility for conservation of names (ICBN, Art. 14).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Current progress in the study of ancient DNA, which also includes herbarium speci-
mens, and making use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are promising (Bruns
ct al., 1990; Wingfield & Wingfield, 1993; K. O'Donnell, pers. communication). It can
be foreseen that in the near future these methods will become optimized and standardized,
and will benefit the elucidation of taxonomic confusion between early and currently used
species concepts.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Volvariella gloiocephala (DC.: Fr.) Bockhout & Enderle and V. speciosa (Fr.: Fr.)
Kummer are currently considered conspecific (Orton, 1974; Boekhout & Enderle, 1986;
Bockhout, 1990), as formerly used differentiating characters were found to overlap strong-
ly. Volvariella gloiocephala was thought to differ from V. speciosa mainly by its greyish
brown pileus, wheras that of V. speciosa is whitish (Shaffer, 1957; Courtecuisse, 1984).
However, the original descriptions do not provide arguments for this distinction as De
Candolle (1815) described the pileus of Agaricus gloiocephalus DC. as "d'un blanc gris
de souris", whereas Fries (1818) described the colour of Amanita speciosa Fr. as "glabro
alba, disco grisco." Moreover, both colours have been found to occur in, supposedly, one
and the same mycelium (e.g. Daams 945, L), and they have been experimentally obtained
from one mycelium (Herrmann, 1973). The species grows saprotrophically and can be
commonly found in gardens, lawns, deciduous forests, agricultural fields, compost,
wood chips, saw dust, etc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Unfortunately, no material of A. gloiocephalus studied by De Candolle is known to be
preserved, nor is an illustration cited in the protologue. Fries (1821) did not refer to any
illustration for Agaricus gloiocephalus or A. speciosus, nor is material known to be pre-
served in UPS. Therefore, a neotype is selected for Volvariella gloiocephala (DC.: Fr.)
Bockhout & Enderle. Generally, it may be preferred to select a neotype from an area
mentioned in the protologue (viz. Montpellier). However, in this case we prefer material
from Germany, which has been studied for many years by one of the authors (M.E.).
There scems no risk for misinterpretation, as considerable consensus on the species
concept of V. gloiocephala exists (see synonymy given by Shaffer, 1957; Bockhout &
Enderle, 1987; Boekhout, 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The neotype of V. gloiocephala (DC.: Fr.) Boekhout & Enderle was collected in Ger-
many, Bavaria, northeast of Riedheim, near Leipheim, MTB 7527/1, growing singly or in
small groups on an arable field owned by G. Kreiss (acre no. 258), collected and identi-
fied by Manfred Enderle, 18 Oct. 1990. It has been deposited in L (988.032-099), and
isoneotypes are placed at M and CBS. Unfortunately, attempts to isolate a culture of the
neotype failed thus far.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No specimens nor illustrations of the species made by Fries are preserved at UPS
(O. Constantinescu, pers. comm.). In the Persoon herbarium (L) a specimen of Agaricus
gloiocephalus DC. is present (L, 910.255-459). It concerns a medium-sized agaric, with
a clear volva. The spores arc broadly ellipsoidal, with a clear apiculus, and measure 11.6—
16.6 x 8.2—9.1 µm. Therefore, Persoon's specimen is considered to agree with the cur-
rent interpretation of the species.#Misc-exposition*]

MELANOLEUCA POLIOLEUCA
FORMA PUSILLA BOEKHOUT & KUYPER
A new name for Melanoleuca polioleuca forma oreina (Fr.: Fr.) Boekhout#Misc-exposition*]

[@TEUN BOEKHOUT! & THOMAS W. KUYPER?#Misc-exposition*]

[@A new name is introduced for the small-sized variant of Melanoleuca polioleuca, formerly
also recognized as f. oreina. The authors demonstrate that the use of this epithet is unde-
sirable because it is not likely that Agaricus oreinus Fr.: Fr. represents the same taxon.#Abstract*]

[@Melanoleuca polioleuca (Fr.: Fr.) Kühn. & Maire is a rather variable species (Bockhout,
1988). In this complex many infraspecific taxa have been described (scc discussion in
Boekhout, 1988: 426). During investigations of the genus in the Netherlands, three more
or less distinct morphological variants have been recognized within this species, which
were given taxonomic status as forma. Unfortunately no information is available on the
evolutionary relationships between those forms, and therefore the hierarchical structure
presented was based on intuition. Forma polioleuca is considered the ‘central’ taxon as it
is most common, whereas the short-stiped (forma /angei Bockhout) and small (forma
oreina (Fr.: Fr.) Boekhout) variants have been interpreted as modifications. However, it
turned out that Agaricus oreinus Fr. (1815: 98) was sanctioned by Fries (1821: 52), while
the epitheton polioleucus was treated as an infraspecific taxon (probably a variety) of
Agaricus melaleucus Pers.: Fr. in the same work (Fries, 1821: 115). Therefore, the name
M. oreina would have priority over M. polioleuca at the species rank, necessitating further
nomenclatural changes. We do not favour such a ‘nomenclatural’ solution as it conflicts
with the existing infraspecific hierarchy of the morphological forms within this species.
One may question whether Agaricus oreinus Fr.: Fr. is closely related to A. melaleucus
y polioleucus Fr.: Fr. as both taxa have been placed in different groups by their author.
Agaricus oreinus Fr.: Fr. was placed in the Tricholomata Personata (pileus semper siccus,
lamellae subrotundatae) (Fries, 1821: 52), whereas A. melaleucus Pers.: Fr. was placed in
the tribe Clitocybe subtribe Thrausti (Fries, 1821: 115). Other differences can be found
in the species descriptions. Agaricus oreinus scems to differ from A. melaleucus Y polio-
leucus by the presence of free lamellae (*lamellis liberis") and a pale stipe ("stipite solido
pallido") (Fries, 1821: 52). In the Epicrisis (Fries, 1838: 46) the pileus was described as
non-hygrophanous (‘nec hygrophano’), whereas the pileus of M. polioleuca is somewhat
hygrophanous. Moreover, as stated earlier, A. oreinus was reported from a rather special-
ized habitat (‘Ericetis montosis’). Fries (1838, l.c.) referred to a plate of Agaricus testu-
dineus Pers., which is an obese fungus with a short stipe, clearly different from the small-

[@sized variant of M. polioleuca. Contrary to our earlier interpretation (Boekhout, 1988) we
presently think it unlikely that A. oreinus is conspecific with A. melaleucus y polioleucus.
Agaricus oreinus Fr.: Fr. seems best interpreted as a nomen dubium.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A second name used for this small variant is Melanoleuca (Agaricus, Tricholoma)
humilis var. fragillima (Fr.) Bon. The small-sized variant of M. polioleuca differs in some
aspects from the description of Agaricus humilis var. fragillima Fr. The most striking dif-
ference is the hollow stipe of A. humilis var. fragillima (Fries, 1838: 52, ‘stipite longiori
cavo fibrillosi’), although this was not reported in this author's earlier description (Fries,
1821: 51). The original description of A. humilis var. fragillima was very short (“Var. tota
fragillima, pileo flavescente, stipite fibrilloso notabilis. In arvis, areis hortorum, pratis &
collibus. Sept.-Nov. v.v.”). No information was provided on the microscopic morphol-
ogy, which is very important in the taxonomy of the genus. Therefore, we are unable to
link A. humilis var. fragillima with any of the currently recognized taxa in Melanoleuca.
Agaricus humilis Pers. has been considered doubtful (Boekhout, 1988), and the same
holds for its variety. Consequently, we prefer to introduce a new name for the small-sized
variant of Melanoleuca polioleuca (Fr.: Fr.) Kühn. & Maire, for which we propose Mela-
noleuca polioleuca forma pusilla Boekhout & Kuyper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena juniperina, collected on bark of Juniperus in southern Norway, is proposed as a
new species belonging to section Supinae. It is compared with the other species of the sec-
tion, from which it is separated on account of the habitat, the pale brown colours of the

[@On the west coast of the Oslo fjord in southern Norway Juniperus communis is wide-
ly distributed, and in some places it actually dominates the landscape. Searching for
Mycenas in these areas has proved to be rewarding, and several new or poorly known
species have been found during the recent years (Aronsen & Maas Geesteranus, 1989;
Maas Geesteranus, 1993; Aronsen, 1994a, and 1994b). Mycena juniperina is another new
species, recently discovered on bark of Juniper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena juniperina belongs to section Supinae Konr. & Maubl. It differs from all the
previously known species of the section (see Maas Geesteranus, 1984). Mycena corticalis
A.H. Smith is the only member of the section that has been reported from conifer, but it
has quite different cheilocystidia which are slender-clavate to almost cylindrical, only 2.5—
5.5 µm wide, and have excrescences up to 40 µm long. In Mycena venustula Quél. the
pileus is pinkish brown to flesh-coloured on a white back-ground, and the lamellar edge
is also pinkish brown to flesh-coloured. Mycena supina (Fr.) Kummer differs in having
cheilocystidia covered with unbranched, fairly short excrescences and smaller spores. The
microscopic characters of M. juniperina show similarities to Mycena meliigena (Berk. &
Cooke apud Cooke) Sacc. and Mycena pseudocorticola Kühn., but those species grow
exclusively on bark of deciduous trees, they have a different colour of both the pileus and
the stipe, the cheilocystidia occur mixed with the basidia, and the hyphae of the pileipellis
have rather shorter excrescences.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Another species that frequently occurs in the same habitat as Mycena juniperina is
Marasmiellus ramealis (Bull.: Fr.) Sing. to which it macroscopically bears a superficial
resemblance. A closer examination, however, will clearly distinguish the two species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fourth volume of this comprehensive flora covers the families of Entolomataceae,
Pluteaceae, Amanitaceae, Agaricaceae, Coprinaceac, Bolbitiaceae, and Strophariaceac.
Many rare taxa are included, as well as small and neglected taxa that hardly, if ever, arc
depicted in popular mushroom guides. The authors have set a trend with this series, par-
ticularly with vol. I and 2, dedicated to the Ascomycetes and Aphyllophorales respective-
ly. The formula of this series is fairly practical with full macroscopic and microscopic
descriptions based on the coloured picture of the mushroom, with schematic, but fairly suf-
ficient microscopic line-drawings. Unfortunately in volume four the authors obviously did
not consult specialists in various groups, resulting in a fairly large number of mistakes
and misidentifications. Some of the most striking are the false identifications of Entoloma
chalybaeum var. chalybaeum (7 ? E. mougeotii), E. juncinum, E. papillatum (doubtful),
E. pseudocoelestinum (false colours), E. saundersii, E. sericeum var. cinereopacum, poor
photo of the poisonous E. sinuatum, Pluteus ephebeus, P. petasatus, Amanita battarae
(2 A. submembranacea), poor pictures of Amanita franchetii and A. porphyrea, same
photo used for both Lepiota echinacea and L. perplexa, poor photo of Leucocoprinus
lanzonii, untypical or false Macrolepiota excoriata. A fairly large number of Coprinus
species is poorly depicted or wrongly named: Coprinus laanii (in reality a mouse-grey
species), C. patouillardii, C. tigrinellus (wrong colour of squamules). Also the micro-
scopic drawings of spores are in some cases inaccurate (C. leiocephalus, C. angulatus),
too old material in the photos of C. cinereus and C. xanthothrix where the veil is washed
off. Coprinus leiocephalus is wrongly named and may represent C. auricomus; C. hepte-
merus is more like C. cordisporus, the photo of C. cortinatus does not resemble that spe-
cies, and that of C. hemerobius probably represents a species from subsect. Setulosi. With-
in the Strophariaceae there are also some mistakes: in the picture of Hypholoma elonga-
tum the lamellae are far too dark for that species, Pholiota jahnii represents P. squarrosa,
Psilocybe merdaria is in reality P. inquilina and under the name Psilocybe subcoprophila
we find a rather good picture of Panaeolus olivaceus. The photos of Stropharia albonitens
and S. semiglobata arc of very poor quality.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this volume the authors present an, at first sight, claborate system of presenting the
spore-print colour, which they recorded with a combination of video and computer-scan-
ning methods. They give with each species a rectangular recording of the exact spore-print
colour. Unfortunately in some cases this is not the true colour. In many Strophariaceae the#Misc-exposition*]

[@typical violaceous tinge of the spore-print is lacking, and also the dark blackish tinges in
many Agaricus and Coprinus species is not fully matched. The identification key in the
book is also based on these spore-print colours, but does not seem to be a great success.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite all criticism, the book offers a lot of valuable information on the taxonomy and
ecology of many rare and interesting taxa, but the price is fairly high.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species formerly placed under Gloeocystidiellum sensu lato are now arranged in onc
of the eight genera of the family Gloeocystidiellaceae. These corticioid fungi are easily rec-
ognized by the presence of large gloeocystidia and amyloid basidiospores. Their sub-
division is mainly based on basidiospore morphology. This paper is a first survey of the
representatives of this group of fungi in Canada and the United States. After a short intro-
duction keys and descriptions of genera and species are presented.#Misc-exposition*]

All species found proved to be new: 22 in Mycena, four in Filoboletus, and one each in
Hydropus, Xeromphalina, Baeospora, and the new genus Cynema. Four new sections
of Mycena are proposed. Of all taxa full descriptions and clear illustrations are presented.#Misc-exposition*]
