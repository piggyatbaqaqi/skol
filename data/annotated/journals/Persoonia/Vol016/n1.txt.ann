[@The genus Crepidotus in Europe is considered. After an examination of 550 collections
seventeen species and eight varieties are recognized. Two keys are supplied; all taxa accept-
ed are typified.#Abstract*]

[@Morphological, ecological and chorological characters are critically evaluated. Descrip-
live statistics are used for basidiospore size. An infrageneric classification is proposed based
on phenetic relationships using different cluster methods, The new combinations C. calo-
lepis var. squamulosus and C. cesatii var. subsphaerosporus are introduced. The spore orna-
mentation as seen in the scanning electron microscope provides the best character for species
delimitation and classification.#Abstract*]

[@INTRODUCTION#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1821: 272) established Agaricus series Derminus tribus Crepidotus for more or
less pleurotoid species with ferruginous or pale argillaceous spores and an ephemeral,
fibrillose veil (!). His fourteen species include such taxa as Paxillus atrotomentosus,
Lentinellus vulpinus, Panellus violaceo-fulvus and Entoloma depluens which nowadays
are placed in quite different genera and families. Only three of Fries' species belong to the
genus Crepidotus as conceived now. This demonstrates the importance of microscopic
characters, neglected by Fries, for the circumscription of species and genera.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Staude (1857) raised the tribus Crepidotus to generic rank with C. mollis as the sole
species. Hesler & Smith (1965) dealt with the history of the genus Crepidotus in more
detail.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In recent years several regional floras have been published, e.g. Ortega & Buendia
(1989) for Spain, Watling & Gregory (1989) for the British Isles and Norstein (1990)
for Norway. None of these includes critical revisions of type collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Pilát (1948) provided the first European monograph. Since then six new species have
been described and new techniques and methods have been developed, e.g. the study of
ultrastructures and numerical taxonomy, which allow a critical reassessment of the taxon-
omy in this genus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A. GENERAL PART#Misc-exposition*]

[@Il. MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The microscopic structures were mainly observed in dried material. Fragments of
lamellae were mounted in Congo red, heated and examined in 596 KOH. The structure
of the pileipellis was examined in 10% ammonia or 5% KOH. The ornamentation and the
colour of the spores were studied in 5% KOH.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore sizes are given with an approximation of 0.5 µm; they are based on 20 spores
measurements per collection. Spores measured were taken from the surface of the pileus.
Q is the length-width ratio of spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@For basidia and cystidia the arithmetic mean of the smallest and the largest object per
collection, with 10 measurements in each case, is given. Unusually extreme sizes are added
in parentheses. The bar equals 1 µm in the SEM pictures, 10 µm in the drawings of micro-
scopic characters, and 1 cm in the drawings of fruit-bodies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colours are compared with Munsell Soil Colour Charts (abbreviated M) and named with
Ridgway (1912) or with Kornerup & Wanscher (1978, abbreviated K & W).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The SEM investigations were carried out with a JEOL JSM-T 300 using accelerating
voltages between 10 and 15 kV. Air-dried spores were coated with gold for 3 minutes.
The nuclei were observed using DAPI staining and fluorescence or by staining with ace-
tocarmine acid.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material from the following herbaria has been investigated: B, BERN, BRNM, C, G,
GDAC, IB, K, L, LAU, M, NMLU, NY, SOM, SZU, TAA, UPS, W, WAG-W, WU
(abbreviations in accordance with Index Herbariorum), La Laguna (Tenerife), Lugano
and from private herbaria: F. Bellu, M. Bon, E. Chételat, H. Engel, H. Hallgrimsson,

Schmitt, F. Tjallingii, W. Winterhoff.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nomenclature of mentioned vascular plants follows Ehrendorfer (1973). Pieces of
wood were determined with Schweingruber (1978).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Collections marked with an asterisk (*) in the list of collections examined are those in
which the number of nuclei in mature spores has been counted (see 2.6).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2. NOTES ON CHARACTERS#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.1. Shape of fruit-body — Fig. 1#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fruit-bodies of all European Crepidotus species are pleurotoid, i.e. when seen from
above, semicircular, rounded flabelliform, reniform, more rarely spathuliform, when seen
from the side plano-convex, applanate, convex, more rarely campanulate. They are dor-
sally or laterally, more rarely centrally attached to the substratum. Fully developed, they
reach 10—30 (100) mm across.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some species have characteristic shapes: 1) younger fruit-bodies are often unguiculate
in the C. cesatii aggr. and in C. luteolus; 2) old fruit-bodies are often crenate at the margin
and furrowed in C. variabilis and C. lundellii; 3) convex caps with a low umbo are typical
for C. mollis; 4) caps are mostly spathuliform to flabelliform in the terrestrial C. autoch-
thonus and occasionally in large fruit-bodies of C. applanatus on logs.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Senn-Irlet: Crepidotus in Europe 3#Page-header*]



[@variabilis luteolus

Fig. 1. Fruit-body shapes.#Figure*]

[@The pileus surface of all species with the exception of the C. mollis-group is tomentose
to felted. The degree in which this characteristic surface texture expresses itself may vary
according to age, weather conditions and probably type of habitat, While the central part
of the pileus surface becomes adpressed-felted to almost smooth, the pileus margin often
remains distinctly tomentose. Scales that can be observed macroscopically are to be found
in C. crocophyllus and C. calolepis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.2. Lamellae#Misc-exposition*]

[@The shape and the spacing of the lamellae is rather uniform: subventricose, more rarely
ventricose, or arcuate, usually crowded, distant only in Crepidotus cesatii. The young
lamellae in all species observed were decurrent at first. Only after expansion of the cap
they become adnexed or almost free. In most species the lamellae are white to very pallid
at first, turning ochraceous-tawny, cinnamon, sayal-brown or snuff-brown with age, with
pinkish tinges mainly in C. cesatii and occasionally in C. variabilis and C. epibryus. Aber-
rant are C. roseoornatus and C. cinnabarinus with orange-pink or salmon-red, C. croco-
phyllus and C. ehrendorferi with pale orange to cinnamon, and C. sambuci sensu Orton
with yellow lamellae; in C. uteolus they are only very pale yellowish.#Misc-exposition*]
[@4 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 1, 1995#Page-header*]

[@In all species the edge of the lamellae is finely fimbriate, floccose only in very young
stages, becoming even. In Crepidotus cinnabarinus it is strikingly red because of the pres-
ence of cystidia with coloured contents.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.3. Fruit-body development — Figs. 26, 28#Misc-exposition*]

[@In many collections early stages of the fruit-body development are to be seen. They all
show the same stipitocarpous development. However, the earliest stages of tissue differ-
entiation have not been observed, therefore an arrangement in Reijnders' classification
(1963) must remain tentative. Primordia can be seen as small, hemispherical warts on the
surface of the substratum without any extended basal mycelium. Very carly centrally stipi-
tate fruit-bodies develop a strongly involute pileus densely covered with erect hyphae (see
Figs. 25, 27). Plate no. 321 in Sowerby (1803) illustrates this development stage. No
velum was observed. The stipe consists of a densely packed trama with parallel hyphae.
At about the height of 1-2 mm the stipe stops growing, the pileus develops excentrically
away from the substratum. The stipe is soon hidden by the young lamellae and the fleshy
parts of the cap; in mature stages of development it is normally obliterated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Crepidotus mollis-group and sometimes C. applanatus develop short and thick
stipes: the stipe grows longer than in the other species, becomes thicker and coalesces
with part of the pileus, but remains visible only from below.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.4. Basidiospores — Figs. 2-25#Misc-exposition*]

[@Characters of the spores are taxonomically the most important ones in the genus Crepi-
dotus. I agree with Hesler & Smith (1965) that spore shape and ornamentation are of
prime importance and that spore size is a diagnostic feature mainly used at species level.
Important is also the colour of the spore deposit and of the spore wall under the light
microscope. A difficulty in establishing spore deposit colour is that a good spore deposit
is not always readily obtained and that the colour changes with age in the herbarium, which
hampers a synoptical comparison of various collections at the same time. As differences
between many species are modest — but probably very constant — the practical use of this
character in identification work is negligible. Under the light microscope three categories
may be discerned (Norstein, 1990): spore wall faintly, moderately and strongly coloured.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The colour of the spore print once played an important role at generic level. Patouillard
(1887) separated Crepidotus with ochraceous to rust-brown spores from the genus Doch-
miopus, with C. variabilis as type, on account of its pink spores. Pilát (1948) rejected this
separation on generic level, added the pinkish colour of young lamellae and a verruculose
or echinulate spore ornamentation as further characters of Dochmiopus reduced to sub-
generic rank. Hesler & Smith (1965) finally characterized their enlarged subgenus Doch-
miopus by the shape of the spores and the presence of clamp-connections. Pinkish or
reddish colours do not play a part in their definition of subgenus Dochmiopus. Kühner
(1980) agrees with the rejection of spore colours as the decisive character for Doch-
miopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Under the light microscope the spores of several species, especially in section Doch-
miopus show granular refractive contents, which are missing in subgenus Crepidotus,
but usually also in C. autochthonus and C. epibryus belonging to subgenus Dochmiopus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@10 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 1, 1995#Page-header*]

[@At the level of SEM analyses, the spore surface reveals the most striking variation of
ornamentation types within the agarics. SEM pictures of Crepidotus have been published
by Pegler & Young (1972), Clémengon (1977), Strid (1975), Bigelow (1980), Luther
& Redhead (1981) and Moreno et al. (1984). All data published by these authors refute
Singer's hypothesis (1947) of the heterogeneous spore wall showing immersed short and
thin columns (see especially Clémengon, 1977).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The only published TEM pictures known are of Crepidotus cesatii and C. applanatus
(Pegler & Young, 1972; Clémengon, 1977). The eusporium, i.c. the inner tegument of
the spore wall, is composed of a thick coriotunica; a pure corium is absent. The myxo-
sporium, i.e. the outer layer of the spore wall, is composed of a heterogeneous epitunica,
which contributes to the ornamentation of the spores. The spines in Crepidotus cesatii are
hollow. Clémengon (1977) discusses the relationships in ultrastructural details between
Crepidotus and the Cortinariaceae. According to this author the arrangement of the spore
wall layers resembles Tubaria more than Cortinarius, but affinities to Cortinarius exist,
e.g. in the presence of a cerostratum. The most important differences are to be found in
the fine layers of the epitunica: hollow spines are unknown in Cortinarius and the podo-
stratum, present in Cortinarius, is absent in Crepidotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ornamentation of European species of Crepidotus may be classified in five cate-
gories. The height of the ornamentations always measures less than 1 µm, which is at the
boundary of perceptibility with the light microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(i) Spores smooth#Misc-exposition*]

[@Under the light microscope as well as in SEM the spores are completely smooth: C.
autochthonus, C. mollis, C. calolepis, C. epibryus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The SEM pictures published by Pegler & Young (1972) display a minutely warty surf-
ace in C. mollis. I interpret this as an artefact due to electric charges during pretreatment.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In SEM analyses C. mollis and C. calolepis often reveal a small apical depression (see
arrow in Fig. 2) which may be interpreted as an apical thinning of the spore wall. Yet
neither a truncate spore apex nor an apical thinning is visible under the light microscope.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(ii) Spores rugulose-verruculose#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore ornamentation consists of low ridges and warts, which may be confluent,
forming at times a rudimentary net with an irregular pattern. Under the light microscope
the spore surface is seen as spotted-granulated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ornamentation up to 0.5 µm: C. subverrucisporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ornamentation 0.2-0.35 µm: C. luteolus, C. lundellii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ornamentation 0.1 —0.25 µm: C. lundellii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(iii) Spores verruculose#Misc-exposition*]
[@The spore wall forms isolated warts. In type | these warts are isolated hemispherical in
side view and round when seen from above. In type 2 these warts are irregular in all views,
often consisting of 2-3 confluent warts and at times decorated by small outgrowths.
Under the light microscope the spores appear punctate; it is therefore not possible to dis-
tinguish between these verruculose types and the baculate type of ornamentation.
Ornamentation 0.2—0.4 µm, verruculose, type 1: C. variabilis, C. cinnabarinus.
Ornamentation 0.2—0.4 µm, verruculose, type 2: C. carpaticus, C. roseoornatus, C.
macedonicus.#Misc-exposition*]
[@Senn-Irlet: Crepidotus in Europe 11#Page-header*]

[@(iv) Spores baculate#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore wall forms truncate, rod-shaped warts or cylindrical processes which are
round as seen from above and which under the light microscope are hardly visible in opti-
cal section, otherwise the spores appear punctate with thick spore walls.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ornamentation 0.3—0.8 µm: C. applanatus, C. crocophyllus, C. ehrendorferi.#Misc-exposition*]

[@(v) Spores echinulate#Misc-exposition*]
[@The ornamentation consists of isolated spines. Under the light microscope these spines
are readily seen in optical section. The surface of the spores appears punctate.
Ornamentation 0.3—0.7 µm: C. cesatii s.1.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.5. Basidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@All European species exhibit four-spored basidia of the common normal cylindric type
in agarics. In some collections two-spored basidia and four-spored basidia occur together.
This always affects the variability of spore size and is interpreted as a result of disturbed
fruit-body development (coldness, drought).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In older fruit-bodies basidia with sterigmata are often lacking. It seems that in those
cases the sterigmata are dissolved and the remnants of the basidia have changed their shape
towards short, broadly cylindrical to almost globose elements, which stain deep red in
Congo red or phloxine. Connected with this ageing process is a swelling of the hyphae in
subhymenium and hymenophoral trama.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Basidia with thickened walls, so-called crassobasidia (Watling & Chandra, 1983) were
observed only two times.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.6. Nuclei#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nuclei in mature spores from at least two collections per species (marked with * in
the list of collections examined) were counted after special treatment. For all species, two
nuclei were found. These results are in accordance with those of Kiihner (1980).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.7. Cystidia#Misc-exposition*]

[@The lamella edge of all species examined is completely sterile, i.e. cheilocystidia are al-
ways present and basidia are absent. Only old damaged exsiccata or old fruit-bodies may
lack cheilocystidia (e.g. C. applanatus, C. epibryus), in which casc they have probably
been rubbed off or disintegrated.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No pleurocystidia have been observed in any European collection.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although the shape of the cheilocystidia within one species or even on the segment of
one individual lamella edge varies considerably, there are still characteristic patterns to be
found (see Table 1).#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.8. Trama#Misc-exposition*]

[@The hymenophoral trama of Crepidotus in general can be described as regular to sub-
regular. Detailed studies, however, reveal two subtypes: one found exclusively in sub-
genus Crepidotus, the other in subgenus Dochmiopus. In the latter, the narrow, 2-4 µm
wide, medium long, cylindrical hyphae first run parallel forming at the time of spore mat-
uration bundles of slightly undulating hyphae, which later partially swell up to 30 µm and
branch during the ageing process. These swollen elements (see Fig. 3) have rounded tips
and are often somewhat constricted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In subgenus Crepidotus the hyphae are from the beginning short-celled and distinctly
wider. Often a well differentiated gelatinous subhymenium develops (see Fig. 26), which
is thickest near the lamella edge. An excellent description of the trama of subgenus Crepi-
dotus is given by Singer (1973: 447).#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the pileus trama the same two types exist: subgenus Crepidotus has its characteristic
gelatinous layer with thin hyphae loosely embedded in a hyaline gelatinous mass. The in-
ferior part of the pileus trama consists of short-celled, branched hyphae which are like a
jigsaw puzzle. In all other groups the pileus trama is composed of one single type without
special differentiation. In some collections the uppermost layer may consist of more dense-
ly packed hyphae (sec Fig. 28). The taxonomic importance of that character is doubtful
and is not used for species delimitation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some species of Crepidotus exhibit refractive vascular hyphae in the pellis and the upper-
most layers of the pileitrama.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.9. Pileipellis#Misc-exposition*]

[@Two main types exist, i.c. a simple cutis in subtypes and a trichoderm. Each of these
two types can be divided into two subtypes: the cutis with (e.g. Crepidotus calolepis) or
without distinct squamules (c.g. C. mollis) and the trichoderm in a subtype with more
or less differentiated terminal cells (e.g. C. subverrucisporus) and a subtype with loose-
ly interwoven, narrowly cylindrical hyphae without differentiated terminal cells (e.g.
C. variabilis). Pileocystidia more or less in the shape of cheilocystidia are present in
Crepidotus applanatus and C. cinnabarinus. In subgenus Dochmiopus a trichoderm is
characteristic, however, a fully developed trichoderm may be found only in very young
specimens or at the margin in older carpophores, because the pileipellis turns into a cutis
in transitional stages. In many species of subgenus Dochmiopus the pileipellis hyphae
may be coiled in various degrees. In opposition to Hesler & Smith (1965) but in accor-
dance with Norstein (1990) I do not believe in the reliability of that character for taxo-#Misc-exposition*]
[@Senn-Irlet: Crepidotus in Europe 13#Page-header*]

[@nomic purposes, because intermediate forms are very frequent. In most fully developed
fruit-bodies with an intact not yet eroded pileus surface, such coiled hyphae can be found
at the margin. At the point of attachment of the fruit-body, however, the hyphae are al-
ways very straight and most often arranged in bundles, forming a rather stiff, strigose
tomentum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@2.10. Pigments#Misc-exposition*]

[@Nothing is known about the chemical compounds of the various red, yellow and brown
pigments in Crepidotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mr. N. Arnold (Regensburg) kindly tried to analyse two small fragments of C. cinna-
barinus with HPLC. The red pigments proved to be hardly soluble and instable in acid
solutions. They show an intensive blue fluorescence at 366 nm. This means that a close
relationship of the C. cinnabarinus pigments with anthrachinons, styrylpyrons, terphenyl-
quinons, and derivates of pulvinic acid can be excluded. After some days the dissolved
soluble red pigments turned to yellow.#Misc-exposition*]

[@3. ECOLOGY#Misc-exposition*]

[@All Crepidotus species are probably saprophytes of wood or woody substrates, mainly
of semi-decomposed twigs or bark of branches and stems, sometimes on culms of herba-
ceous plants. In all woody substrates signs of white rot were observed. In all cases studied
no other lignicolous agaric was fruiting in the immediate vicinity during the fruiting period
of the concerning species of Crepidotus, nor were there more fruit-bodies of more than
one Crepidotus species present on the substrate.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One species, Crepidotus autochthonus, fruits almost exclusively and a second, C. ver-
sutus, frequently on soil, most probably, however, always in connection with forest litter
or wood. Two other species (C. luteolus, C. epibryus) occur mainly on dead culms of
phanerogams (Urtica, Rumex, Solidago, Gramineae, Equisetum, among others).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Table II gives a survey of all registered substrates. As several different substrates can
be present in one collection, the number of substrates is higher than the number of collec-
tions.
#Misc-exposition*]
[@About 70% of all collections occur on deciduous wood, 11% on coniferous wood,
11% on culms of different phanerogams and 4% on mosses and litter (of hardwood). Al-
most each species can grow on hardwood, but several do not occur on coniferous wood.
In relation to their presence in European forests Salix, Fraxinus, and probably also Alnus
are over-represented, indicating a habitat preference of many Crepidotus species for moist
alluvial forests or montane ravine forests.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Specific literature on the sociology of Crepidotus species is still very scarce. According
to the few articles, Crepidotus species never form the dominant element in any European
vegetation unit. Nevertheless, one mycosociological unit has been named after a Crepi-
dotus species: Crepidotus calolepis is described by Jahn (1966) as being the most impor-
tant species of the Crepidotetum calolepidis, a saprophytic association on decayed wood
of Populus tremula in Sweden. Out of four distinct degradation stages, C. calolepis is the
characteristic species of stage three, the optimal phase for basidiomycetes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus mollis is reported from a hygrophilous birchwood on peat (Betuletum
pubescentis) in Poland (Bujakiewicz, 1986), from alluvial forests on calcareous grounds
near Leipzig (Buch & Kreisel, 1957) and Colmar (Carbiener, 1981), from mesophilous
beech forests (Mercuriali-Fagetum) in Poland (Lisiewska, 1974) as well as from more
dry, acidophilous oak-hornbeam forests (Galio-Carpinetum) near Munich (Einhellinger,
1964) and near Geneva (Horak & Rollin, 1988). My own collections mainly origin from
alluvial forest types.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus variabilis was observed in vegetation units which differ significantly in their
ecological claims: mesophilous beech forests (Mercuriali-Fagetum, Melico-Fagetum) in
Poland (Lisiewska, 1963, 1974), moist alder forests (Carici elongatae-Alnetum) in Ber-
lin (Gerhardt, 1978), moist heathland (Arnico-Genistetum anglicae ) in the Netherlands
(Arnolds, 1982), acid oakwoods (Dicrano-Quercetum, Querco-Betuletum) in the Nether-
lands (Jansen, 1984) and acid oak-hornbeam forests (Galio-Carpinetum) near Geneva
(Horak & Róllin, 1988).#Misc-exposition*]
[@16 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 1, 1995#Page-header*]

[@As opposed to Crepidotus variabilis which is obviously more frequently reported from
woods on acid soils, C. cesatii var. cesatii prefers woods on more basic soils. Crepidotus
cesatii is reported from alluvial forest in Alsace (Carbiener, 1981) and from a thermophil-
ous beech forest (Carici-Fagetum) in Switzerland (Brunner, 1987). Own observations
confirm a coherence with Fagion and Alno-Padion associations, i.e beech forests and al-
luvial forests.#Misc-exposition*]

[@4. CHOROLOGY#Misc-exposition*]

[@An accurate assessment of European or holarctic distribution patterns exhibited by
fugitive organisms such as small agarics which need a time-consuming microscopic
examination, will likely remain an impossible task still for many years. Nevertheless,
thanks to several regional floras published in recent years (Hallgrimsson, 1973; Ortega &
Buendia, 1989; Watling & Gregory, 1989; Norstein, 1990; Senn-Irlet, 19922) our knowl-
edge on distribution patterns has increased. On the one hand northern boundaries of
Crepidotus species in Norway are rather well known (Norstein, 1990). Expeditions to
Greenland gave further information on the few species which extend in subarctic and
arctic areas (Senn-Irlet, 1992b). On the other hand the southern boundaries are imper-
fectly known. While some information exists from the western mediterranean region
including the Canary Islands (Malengon & Bertault, 1975; Bafiares-Baudet et al., 1986;
Ortega & Buendia, 1989), almost no records are known from the eastern mediterranean
region.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Despite these problems I have tentatively assigned the Crepidotus species treated to
some general distribution types, based, however, exclusively on specimens examined by
myself. The distribution types are based on the north-south zonation proposed by Meusel
et al. (1965) and mainly characterized by a temperature gradient.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In addition to this gradient in latitude Meusel et al. (1965) distinguish a gradient in lon-
gitude. This west-east gradient in Europe, i.e. the degree of continentality in the terminol-
ogy of these authors, is mainly determined by precipitation. As almost all agarics need
humid conditions to develop fruit-bodies, the presence of Crepidotus species in dry areas
with cold winter must be restricted to local habitats with more humid conditions which
cannot find expression in diagrams of the macroclimate. Without a better knowledge of
Crepidotus habitats in castern Europe possible differences in distribution related to longi-
tude gradients cannot be discussed.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The distribution areas of most European species of Crepidotus seem to be continu-
ous. Exceptions are C. carpaticus occurring at some isolated spots from Great Britain
to the Vosges (France), Alps (Switzerland) and Carpathes (Ucrainia), C. cesatii var.
subsphaerosporus with records from the boreal region and the montane zone of the tem-
perate regions (Alps) and probably occurring elsewhere in spruce forests or plantations,
and C. calolepis var. calolepis, which seems to have a genuine disjunct distribution: num-
erous records prove the presence of a southern area in the mediterranean region and a
northern one in Scandinavia and the Baltic. The isolated European localities of the very
conspicuous C. cinnabarinus suggest introduction by man from North America.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5. RESULTS OF STATISTICAL ANALYSES#Misc-exposition*]

[@5.1. Descriptive statistics of basidiospore size#Misc-exposition*]

[@As stated before the basidiospores exhibit the most important taxonomic characters in
Crepidotus. In addition to the spore ornamentation the size and shape, the latter expressed
with the length-width ratio Q, provide unique dimensions for each species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Based on a random sample of 20 measured spores per collection (usually one fruit-
body), the 95% population limits (p = sd x t; sd = standard deviation with population
parameter *n-1', t — tolerance limit according to Wissenschaftliche Tabellen Geigy 1980)
of the spore size can be calculated to gain some information about the range of each collec-
tion and furthermore, by computing the limits with the mean values of each collection, about
the totality of the collections that are grouped in one species (Table IIT). Figs. 32 and 33
visualize the frequency distribution of my measurements.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the strength of one parameter alone (spore length, width or volume) not all species
can be separated. But combinations of at least two of these characters allow for an individ-
ual characterization as can be seen in Fig. 34.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5.2. Special problems#Misc-exposition*]
[@In species complexes, where several taxa may be involved, a statistical approach seems
suitable. In all cases the spores are concerned.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5.2.1. Crepidotus mollis-group — Fig. 35; Table IV#Misc-exposition*]

[@In European literature C. calolepis and its var. squamulosus have often been treated as
varieties of C. mollis. According to a widely accepted morphological species concept (see
Kuyper, 1988) a good species differs in at least two interindependent morphological char-
acters. Spore size in combination with features of the pileipellis fulfil this claim.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Recently Norstein (1990) used descriptive and inductive statistics in the C. mollis-group.
He proved that collections with a scaly pileus grow most frequently on Fraxinus whereas
those with a glabrous pileus are more frequent on Populus. Moreover, the width of the
spores is highly correlated with the scaliness of the pileus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In Fig. 35 a histogram displays the frequency distribution for spore sizes, expressed
as the volume, grouped on the basis of independent morphological characters, viz. the
presence or absence of scales on the pileus and the diameter of the hyphae of the scales.
The scales are formed by hyphae which are brown incrusted with intra- and extracellular
pigments. It is obvious that three distinct groups exist. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test,
which does not require a normal distribution of the data, as well as the t-test performed
with values transformed into normal logarithms showed highly significant differences at a
0.01 level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@5.2.2 Crepidotus applanatus-group — Fig. 36; Table V#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the group of C. applanatus the differences in spore size are less obvious than in the
C. mollis-group. Yet, a grouping of the spores (volumes) with regard to their substrate
(hardwood versus coniferous wood) in Fig. 36 shows clear tendencies towards a small-
spored taxon on hardwood and a large-spored taxon on coniferous wood. However, two
collections from hardwood exhibit spore volumes which are almost double as large as the
mean of the small-spored group. These collections are omitted in Table V as they may
represent an undescribed taxon from Eastern Europe. Once more the Wilcoxon-Mann-
Whitney test and the t-test, again performed with transformed values, proved the presence
of two significantly different populations within C. applanatus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus crocophyllus, a closely related species, has spore sizes which as seen as a
population are distinctly and significantly larger than those of var. subglobigera. One sam
ple, however, i.e. one collection may well have spores of which the sizes cannot be sepa-
rated from those of a large-spored collection of var. subglobigera. But for identification
C. crocophyllus is characterized by several other morphological characters (see below).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within the C. cesatii-group the spore size varies considerably, which probably indi-
cates a genetic polymorphism. But a clear correlation of spore volumes with other char-
acters could not be found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, spore shape expressed by means of the length-width ratio allows the distinc-
tion of two populations: one on hardwood and one on coniferous wood. Norstein (1990)
was the first to pay attention to this fact, which he was able to prove statistically on the
basis of Norwegian material. He even found a significant correlation with a morphological
character, viz. the degree of coiling of the hyphae of the pileipellis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Figure 39, displaying an ordination diagram from principle component analysis, gives
a good impression of a possible delimitation of three distinct groups within the genus Cre-
pidotus.#Figure*]

[@Figs. 40 and 41 display the two main phenogram types obtained by other methods, i.c.
1-Pearson, Euclidean, Gower, and Canberra as distance metrics and Average Linkage,
Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using arith-
metic averages, see Sneath & Sokal, 1973), sums of squares as cluster algorithms. They
all indicate the same important results as also Fig. 39: the genus can be divided into three
main groups as the phenograms clearly display the following subdivisions:#Misc-exposition*]

[@(i) the group with a gelatinous layer, and a short-celled trama: Crepidotus mollis-group
(subgenus Crepidotus sensu Hesler & Smith);#Misc-exposition*]

[@(ii) the group with ellipsoid, smooth or rugulose spores (subgenus Dochmiopus sensu
Hesler & Smith);#Misc-exposition*]

[@(iii) the group with globose, baculate or echinulate spores (subgenus Sphaerula Hesler
& Smith).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Broadly outlined the phenogram of Fig. 40 reflects the divisions proposed by Hesler &
Smith (1965). In detail, however, it reveals some important differences. While Hesler &
Smith accentuate one single character — the missing clamp-connections — as the main rea-
son for separating subgenus Crepidotus, the phenogram based on an overall similarity of
chosen characters, distinguishes this subgenus on a combination of various characters.
For the group around C. mollis at least two characters unique within the genus are ob-
served: it is the gelatinous upper layer and the type of structure of the lower trama of the
pileus. The other members of subgenus Crepidotus sensu Hesler & Smith should there-
fore be placed in other subgenera, which means that the absence or presence of clamp-
connections is not a very important character in Crepidotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@28 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 1, 1995#Page-header*]

[@The taxonomic importance of clamp-connections has been discussed before. Horak
(1964) attaches no importance at all to this feature in Crepidotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Important characters for an infrageneric classification of Crepidotus apparently are the
shape and the ornamentation of the spores. Both Singer (1947) and Hesler & Smith (1965)
used these characters but in different ways: Singer considered the character of the spore
ornamentation as more important than the shape, whereas Hesler & Smith found the latter
character more important. In the phenograms presented here the subdivision is based on a
combination of these characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Analysing the differences in the various phenograms obtained, of which in Figs. 40
and 41 two are shown, one can observe that two species, i.c. Crepidotus variabilis and
C. cesatii change their position within the three large groups. On the one hand these spe-
cies are attached in all UPGMA clustering to the group with C. /undellii and C. luteolus,
on the other hand they are put together with C. applanatus and C. crocophyllus in Fig. 40
using Pearson's correlation coefficient. In other words the positions of these species are
weak and the final attachment to onc group remains to a certain degree a personal decision
of the taxonomist, as at least two solutions are supported by numerical analyses.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I conclude that, based on European species, the genus Crepidotus is best devided into
two subgenera, i.c. subgenus Crepidotus and subgenus Dochmiopus, and the latter sub-
genus into two section (section Dochmiopus and section Crepidotellae). Mainly judging
from the literature, I am convinced that this infrageneric classification will hold out when
extra-European species are taken into consideration and will turn out to have predictive
value.#Misc-exposition*]

or less glabrous; lamellae radiating from a lateral or strongly eccentric point of attachment;
spores in deposit brown, clay-colour, snuff-brown, cinnamon; spore wall single and thin
or double and thick, smooth or ornamented and then the ornamentation consisting (1) very
short rods, warts or spines or (2) structures caused by a wrinkling, rugulose to verru-
culose exosporium, globose, subglobose or ellipsoid to elongate, without germ-spore;
cheilocystidia present and often branched; pileocystidia present in some species. Trama of
the pileus subregular, sometimes with a gelatinous layer. Hyphae of the pileipellis either
slightly or not at all differentiated, in species with a somewhat tomentose pileus mostly
curved to coiled, or sharply differentiated and then repent and sometimes incrusted with
brownish ring-like pigments; clamp-connections present or more rarely absent and in the
latter case lacking from all tissues. Stipe only visible in young fruit-bodies, short and
eccentric, lacking in older fruit-bodies and these sometimes forming a remarkable short
and thick stump. Veil none.#Description*]

[@Some species, such as Clitopilus hobsonii, Cheimonophyllum candidissimum, and
species of Panellus, Hohenbuehelia and Pleuroflammula have often been mistaken for
Crepidotus species. Of these only the representatives of the last genus have brown col-
oured spores, which, however, are ferruginous-fulvous and distinctly more strongly col-
oured than those in any Crepidotus. For further characters of the genus Pleuroflammula
see Horak (1978). The rest have hyaline spores, when seen under the light microscope.
Spores of Clitopilus are recognized by their longitudinal ribs and are angular in polar
view,#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus haustellaris sensu Pilát is not a member of the genus Crepidotus. It is much
better placed in Simocybe on account of the colour of its spore print with distinct olivace-
ous tints, the shape of the spores, the presence of a germ-pore and the structure of the
pileipellis which is a turf of pileocystidia and exudations.#Misc-exposition*]

is easily identified. It seems to be the only species fruiting in cracks of living trees and
therefore probably has parasitic capacities.#Misc-exposition*]

[@There exist forms with some coloured innate fibrils or even scale-like fibrils, which
may be confounded with Crepidotus calolepis. In such cases the spore forms have to be
examined carefully, C. mollis is characterized by narrower spores and hyphae of the pilei-
pellis which are never heavily incrusted.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries (1878) gives an excellent illustration of this species and despite his remark that
C. calolepis lacks a gelatinous layer, I consider this illustration as a perfect presentation of
his concept of it. An extended study of Scandinavian material (Norstein, 1990) as well as
of Moroccan material (Malengon & Bertault, 1975) did not reveal any collection without a
gelatinous layer, but this layer may be very thin and therefore may have escaped Fries’
observation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus applanatus belongs to a species complex that is especially rich in North
America, comprising almost all taxa described by Hesler & Smith (1965: 40, 71) in subsec-

mainly by spore size, nature of the covering of the pileus, and colour of the fruit-bodies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Within C. applanatus two of the variants accepted by Hesler & Smith (1965) exist in
Europe. As shown above (see Table V, Fig. 36) spore size is a separating character on
population level but not always on sample level. However, a clear correlation exists
between the shape of the cheilocystidia and the substrate which allows for taxonomic
separation on an infraspecific level.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Under the light microscope the spores of C. carpaticus do not differ from those of
C. applanatus. SEM pictures, however, show differences in spore ornamentation. While
C. applanatus always exhibits typical baculate spores, the ornamentation within C. carpa-

as was demonstrated by Bigelow (1980) for C. nyssicola (Murr.) Sing. The spores of
C. carpaticus are verruculose-truncate without or with small protuberances at the apex of
warts. These protuberances were first observed by Pegler & Young (1972).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Based on macroscopical features alone, the pinkish tints of the young lamellae and the
(sub)distant lamellae are characteristic. Microscopically the species is easy recognizable
because of its antler-like cheilocystidia and the echinulate spores. Crepidotus cesatii var.
cesatii is the most common European Crepidotus species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@I have seen several collections with small and very variable spores (« 6 µm). Each of
these collections, however, had signs of a disturbed development, i.c., I found many
two-spored basidia in collections in which the spore size and form varies considerably
from 5—9 µm, from globose to oblong on the same lamella. In one collection (Senn-I/rlet
90/2) cystidioles (pleurocystidia sensu Hesler & Smith, 1965) were present on the sur-
face of the lamella. I interpret these abnormalities as being induced by drought or low
temperatures and therefore without any taxonomic significance. Crepidotus cesatii var.
cesatii, fruiting throughout the year and several times on the very same substrate, seems
to be especially susceptible to climatic influences.#Misc-exposition*]

[@pretation of this taxon. Although no original material is left (Pfister, 1977), it is clear that
Patouillard described and depicted Agaricus variabilis var. sphaerosporus as a taxon with
perfectly globose spores, leaving no doubt about the spore shape. Yet, he noticed conif-
erous twigs as substrate, which is very rare for this taxon. A re-examination of the holo-
type of Agaricus cesatii from Italy where it was growing on Platanus, showed globose
spores of 7—9 µm. The type material in B is in very poor condition: almost nothing is left.
The spores were found in droppings of insects close to the original place of the fruit-
body. But there is no longer any doubt that Rabenhorst described a taxon with globose
spores. Therefore C. sphaerosporus must be regarded as a synonym of C. cesatii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus variabilis belongs to those species with a white pileus and fairly crowded
lamellae that are quite impossible to identify without microscopical examination. The
lobed, undate margin, however, proved to be a rather good indication. The cylindrical
spore-shape is the best indicative character for this species. Crepidotus variabilis has the
smallest spores in respect to a calculated volume of 36.5 µm?.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Already Pilát (1948), after having examined several distributed exsiccates, emphasized
the fact that C. variabilis has often been misinterpreted. I share with Norstein (1990) the sus-
picion that Fries himself may have included other small, white Crepidotus species, such
as C. cesatii, C. subverrucisporus and probably C. /undellii, in his concept of a ‘variable’
species aptly named Agaricus variabilis, as these species are rather common in southern
Scandinavia (see Norstein, 1990).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus lundellii belongs to the white Crepidotus species that require an accurate
microscopical analysis for identification. However, the clay-coloured to snuff-brown
lamellae without any pinkish tints may be a good indication in the field.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The faint spore ornamentation, the shape of the cheilocystidia, and the structure of the
pilcipellis distinguish C. lundellii from C. subverrucisporus, the latter with narrowly
lageniform cheilocystidia and strongly ornamented spores. Crooked terminal cells in the
pileipellis, typical for C. subverrucisporus, have never been observed in C. lundellii.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The type of spore ornamentation, viz. very low ridges and warts, proved to be very
constant in the SEM.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Beside C. epibryus and C. subverrucisporus no other European Crepidotus species got
so many names as C. lundellii. The main differences for the separation of these taxa
are the shape (broadly oblong vs amygdaliform) of the spores and minor discrepancies
in spore size, and the presence or absence of yellowish tints on the pileus (see paragraph
5.2.4). It is true, that C. lundellii shows considerable variation in these characters, but I
am unable to separate more taxa; too many intermediates exist. I did not find one single
collection with exclusively amygdaliform spores; all collections have a certain percentage
of oblong to broadly oblong spores. Norstein (1990) comes to the same conclusion.#Misc-exposition*]

[@One infraspecific delimitation, however, seems possible: three collections from Fagus
and Salix twigs (L 981.282-322, L 981.180-132, SZU 223-89) have very small (mean
length < 7 µm) spores which are all broadly oblong. They fit perfectly the concept of
C. lundellii var. subglobisporus (Pilát) Pilát. For the time being the recognition of an
infraspecific taxon is, however, not warranted, since the difference of the mean length of
the spores between the largest of the small-spored group and the smallest of the large-
spored group is only 0.3 µm (see also Fig. 38) and no other distinguishing character has
been found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Macroscopically it is difficult to distinguish this species from other white Crepidotus
species. The dark, distinctly rugulose spores and the narrowly lageniform cheilocystidia
are the most important distinctive characters.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Dried specimens are most often light orange (K & W SAS, SA4, 6A5, 6A4) which
may give rise to a confusion with Crepidotus luteolus from which C. subverrucisporus
is best separated by the shape of the spores and the elongate cystidia with acute apex.
Unfortunately most herbarium collections lack notes on the fresh fruit-body colours;
therefore it remains uncertain if C. subverrucisporus exhibits yellowish tints also in living
specimens.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Crepidotus subverrucisporus is rather variable in several microscopical characters:
among the cheilocystidia of the holotype are some septate and branched ones. Exactly the
same shapes were found in one other collection (IB, Moser 83/466) from northern Italy,
on Robinia also. If further collections will prove that this character is constant, it might
well serve for infraspecific delimitation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Several mycologists (Pilát, 1948; Moser, 1983; Watling & Gregory, 1990) separate
this species from the genus Crepidotus and place it in Pleurotellus. Their main reason for
maintaining the genus Pleurotellus is the pale spore colour. Indeed, that is a striking char-
acter of C. epibryus. Yet, spore colour varies considerably within the genus Crepidotus,
being an important taxonomic character on species level for most authors.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The spore shape, another striking character of Crepidotus epibryus, resembles strong-
est that of C. versutus. Again this can be seen as the extreme on a line along which spores
are becoming more and more elongated. Dyads and tetrads of spores are often observed in
C. versutus as well.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Smooth spore walls occur in several species of Crepidotus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The cheilocystidia of C. epibryus have often been overlooked in the past, as they col-
lapse easily and therefore seem to be lacking in old or poorly dried herbarium material.
The circumscription of Pleurotellus as having no cystidia is therefore untenable, as it is
typified by P. graminicola Fay. (see Horak, 1968), in my opinion a synonym of C. epi-#Misc-exposition*]

those found in C. versutus. Singer (1973) indicates similar cystidia for C. polylepidis and
C. longicystis. Substrates and habitats of C. epibryus are similar to those of C. luteolus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In view of the above picture I do not see any good reason for separating C. epibryus
from Crepidotus in a genus of its own. The characters in common are overwhelming:
(i) fruit-body development, (ii) structure of hymenophoral trama, (iii) structure of the
pileipellis, (iv) colour of the lamellae; occasionally with pinkish tinges (collection of
Spooner at Kew); snuff-brown in occasional large fruit-bodies (c.g. BERN 90/4), shape
of fruit-body.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Agaricus (Crepidotus) epibryus Fr. has been interpreted in many different ways, at
least three species have been confused in this process.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Fries stresses the fact that his small species with a white, sericeous pileus grows on
mosses. Not so many Crepidotus species occur on mosses (see Table II). Besides with
C. luteolus, this is occasionally the case with C. /undellii and C. cesatii, but these three
species have brownish lamellae, thus not fitting Fries’ description: “lamellis confertis
gilvis.” The descriptions of C. epibryus of Quélet (1872) and Romagnesi (1937) stress
mainly spore shape and ornamentation and agree with C. /uteolus. A critical analysis of
Pilát's description (1948) of C. epibryus and a re-examination of specimens listed under
C. epibryus (c.g. de Thümen, Mycoth. univ. no. 401) convinced me, that Pilát's circum-
scription of C. epibryus includes at least partly C. luteolus and C. subverrucisporus.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Cooke (1884—1886) illustrates on plate 516 C a fungus, growing on grasses, with a
very thin pileus called Agaricus epibryus, representing what many mycologists call Crepi-
dotus (Pleurotellus) herbarum. Karsten (1879) as well notes herbs as substrate of Phialo-
cybe epibrya and thus describes most probably the same species as Cooke.#Misc-exposition*]

[@An important macroscopical character of Crepidotus herbarum, i.e. C. epibryus, is the
fact that the lamellae rarely turn deep brown, but remain pale ochraceous, that is ‘gilvus’!
Having in mind that this species in widely distributed in Scandinavia (Norstein, 1990) and
grows sometimes on mosses I conclude that it can hardly be doubted that Fries’ original
description of A. epibryus covers what is usually called C. herbarum.#Misc-exposition*]

[@sambuci. — Crepidotus sambuci Vel., Ceské Houby (1922) 919.#Nomenclature*]

[@According to Pilát (1949) a synonym of Crepidotus haustellaris, i.c. Simocybe rubi.
The Latin description of Pilát (1948), however, differs in some details from the present
concept of that species. The cap is described as "'... extus glaber, albus, solum basi long
tomentosus, ...”; the lamellae “... initio sublutescentibus, tum griseo-ochraceis ...”.
While the microscopical characters are in accordance with those of S. rubi, the macro-
scopical characters fit other species better. Orton (1960) recorded tentatively a collec-
tion as C. sambuci, which represents undoubtedly a typical Crepidotus species close to
C. lundellii. Indeed, the microscopical details for C. sambuci given by Velenovsky agree
very well with those of C. lundellii, viz. the ovoid spores and the often capitate cheilo-
cystidia. Unfortunately the original description lacks any information on spore ornamen-
tation. Moser (1983) accepted Orton's interpretation; but till now the species has been
only recorded from Great Britain. I examined only one collection labelled as C. sambuci
gathered by the Dutch mycologist F. A. Tjallingii accompanied by extensive notes. With
the exception of the lemon-yellow colours observed in the young fruit-bodies, the col-
lection did not deviate from the range of variation of C. /undellii. For the time being I
consider C. sambuci as doubtful species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Biological Station, Wijster (Drenthe), The Netherlands#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the second part of this study special attention is paid to the genera Hebeloma, Psathyrel
la and Russula. Psathyrella rhombispora is described as a new species. Russula cicatricata
Romagn., R. elaeodes (Bres.) Romagn. and R. purpurata Crawsh. arc reduced to formae of
R. graveolens Romell. in Britz.#Abstract*]

[@This paper is a continuation of an earlier paper (Keizer & Arnolds, 1994). It presents
descriptions, drawings and observations of rare, critical or less well-known macromycetes
that were encountered during mycocoenological investigations carried out in road-side
verges planted with Quercus robur (53 plots) or Fagus sylvatica (23 plots). For further
details on the scope of this study, the reader is referred to the first part of this paper
(Keizer & Arnolds, l.c.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The fungi dealt with in this study comprise the Macrofungi. Groups with relatively
small or hidden fruit-bodies (c.g. the majority of the Helotiales, resupinate Aphyllophora-
les) have been omitted becausc a complete inventory would require a much more time
consuming search strategy. The following groups have been included: Basidiomycetes:
Agaricales; Gasteromycetes; non-resupinate Aphyllophorales and Heterobasidiomycetes.
Ascomycetes: Clavicipitales: Cordyceps; Elaphomycetales: Elaphomyces; Helotiales: Geo-
glossum, Leotia; Pezizales: Helvellaceae, Pezizaceae, Tuberaceae; Deuteromycetes: Paeci-
lomyces.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The nomenclature of the Basidiomycetes is mainly after Kreisel (1987) or Arnolds
(1984) if species are not mentioned in the former work. The nomenclature of the smooth
spored species of the genus /nocybe is after Kuyper (1986) and of the genus Psathyrella
after Kits van Waveren (1985). Ascomycetes are after Cannon et al. (1985) and Deutero-
mycetes after Arnolds (1.c.).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Full understanding of mycocoenological studies is often hampered by the absence or
incompleteness of descriptions of critical taxa. Therefore, descriptions and/or critical
notes are given in this paper of rare and critical taxa and of collections, which disagreed
with descriptions in literature. This criterion has been taken in a rather broad sense. The#Misc-exposition*]

[@“II n'est pas de genre oü la taxonomie des espéces soit plus embrouillée. C'est un
véritable chaos." (Favre, 1960). It seems that little has changed since, despite recent
revisions of the genus (Bruchet, 1970; Bockhout, 1982). The taxa that could be distin-
guished in the present material agreed rather well with the concepts of Boekhout (I.c.),
which, for the time being, have been adopted. Particularly the taxa which belong to the
species complex H. crustuliniforme sensu lato are difficult to separate (see there). The
extremes in this complex are widely different, but most of the differentiating characters
are not correlating in many less typical collections.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hebeloma anthracophilum shows much resemblance with H. spoliatum in the micro-
scopical characters. Macroscopically, the distinctly rooting stipe and more uniformly red-
brown pileus of the latter are characteristic. We agree with Bockhout (1982) in consid-
ering H. calyptrosporum Bruchet synonymous with H. anthracophilum. The only differ-
ences mentioned by Bruchet (1970) are the habitat (growing on burnt places or not) and
the stipe turning brownish with age or not. Differences in habitat alone cannot serve as
distinguishing characters and a discolouring of the stipe with age is so common in the
genus Hebeloma that it is certainly not sufficient to distinguish taxa on the level of spe-
cies, if it is of any use at all.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hebeloma crustuliniforme sensu lato#Misc-exposition*]

[@It appeared to be difficult to identify Hebeloma species of the group of H. crustulini-
forme (x section Denudata (Fr.) Sacc.). This group as a whole is characterized by carpo-
phores without veil, with long (+ 50-100 µm), narrowly clavate to capitate cheilocystidia
and amygdaliform spores with at most partially loosening perispore.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In order to separate taxa in a more or less objective way, groups have been distinguish-
ed in the 30 available collections, following the method described by Arnolds (1974): the
groups were distinguished on the basis of characters that will be mentioned below, inde-
pendent from previous species concepts in the literature. Subsequently, these groups were
compared with taxa (species) described in literature. The advantage of this method is that
individual collections are not ‘forced’ to match the description of a certain taxon. The fol-
lowing characters have been used: 1) habit, i.e. size and shape of the fruit-body; 2) colour
of the pileus; 3) stipe hollow or not; 4) lamellae weeping at the edge or not, droplets wa-
tery or milk-white; 5) size and shape of the cheilocystidia; 6) size and shape of the spores;
type of ornamentation; loosening of the perispore or not; reaction with Melzer’s reagent;
7) smell.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The characters 3 and 4 appeared to be too variable, even within collections, to be use-
ful, although they are considered by some authors as rather important (e.g. Bruchet, 1970;
Moser, 1978, 1992; Vesterholt, 1992). In general, the stipe tends to become hollow as the
sporocarp ages. Moreover, slender carpophores tend to have less often hollow stipes. Al-
so the formation of droplets at the edge of the lamellae appears to be age-dependent (old
specimens ccase guttation) and varies with weather conditions. Dry weather hampers the
excretion of liquid. This liquid can turn milky white after some time, which again makes
the character dependent of the moment of collecting of the fruit-body. Vesterholt (1992)
considers the degree of browning in the course of sporocarp development of taxonomic
importance. In our opinion its use offers difficulties in practice as sporocarps of the same
age must be compared, which are often not available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Because mycocoenologists, unlike taxonomists, are often forced to study fruit-bodies
in far from optimal conditions, most value has been assigned in this study to microscopic
characters, assuming that they are less influenced by external factors than macromorpho-
logical characters. In our opinion, the characters of weeping lamellae and the presence of a
cavity in the stipe as well as the density of the white floccose squamules covering the stipe,
discussed in Boekhout (1982), together with so-called ecological characters, have been
overestimated in literature, thus contributing to the confusion in this group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the basis of the shape and size of the cheilocystidia three groups could be distin-
guished with a) cheilocystidia rather short, e.g. 40—60 µm, the majority slenderly clavate
with somewhat ventricose base, frequently with (sub)capitate apex; b) cheilocystidia 40—
80 µm long, except for the very short ones (« 40 µm, always present together with the
longer cystidia) usually not ventricose but with more or less parallel walls near the basis,
very gradually broadening towards the apex; apex frequently furcate or more or less irreg-
ularly shaped; c) cheilocystidia up to 100 µm long, not ventricose near the base, hardly
broader towards the apex to slenderly clavate, or a minority of the cystidia irregularly cap-
itate. These groups were identified as H. helodes, H. longicaudum and H. crustuliniforme
ss. str. respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Some of the above-mentioned characters correlated rather well with the different form
and size of the cheilocystidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@1) Habit of the fruit-body: Hebeloma crustuliniforme ss.str. has large and relatively
thick-set carpophores, with context in the pileus relatively thick (up to more than 10 mm
in centre) and with thick stipe (over 6 mm, near base over 10 mm thick). Hebeloma helo-
des and H. longicaudum generally have smaller pilei and more slender stipes.#Description*]

[@2) Colour of the pileus: H. crustuliniforme has a + uniform pale brown or alutaceous
pileus; the other two species usually have a darker reddish brown centre contrasting with
a pale margin.#Misc-exposition*]

[@6) Size and shape of the spores: H. longicaudum has relatively broad spores with
av. Q 2 1.56-1.71, whereas H. crustuliniforme and H. helodes have more slender spores
with av. Q — (1.69—)1.72—1.92(—-2.14) respectively (Fig. 3).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Differences in consistence of the stipe (3), weeping of lamellae (4) and smell (7) did
not correlate with the size and shape of the cheilocystidia; all specimens had a raphanoid
smell. The differences in characters of the spores (6) other than size and shape, such as
type of ornamentation, colour (under the microscope), loosening of the outer spore-wall
and differences in dextrinoid reaction with Melzer's reagent, described by Bockhout
(1.c.), Bruchet (l.c.) and Vesterholt (l.c.), could not be confirmed by the study of the
present material.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Hebeloma crustuliniforme comes closest to H. helodes. Robust carpophores of the lat-
ter with long cystidia can only be separated from the former by the darker and contrasting
centre of the pileus, and this hardly warrants a distinction on specific level. It seems, how-
ever, that this problem occurs in only a minority of the collections. For further details, sec

[@Typically, the cheilocystidia of H. helodes are rather short and slender. Other types of
cheilocystidia have been encountered in several collections: 1) Cystidia up to 60 µm long,
clavate and frequently with thickened walls in the middle part. This variant is identical with
H. fragilipes Romagn., which was regarded by Bockhout (1982) as a variety of H. helodes
(Fig. 4d). 2) Cystidia long and slender (up to 90-100 µm), only slightly clavate. This
variant is identical with H. oculatum Bruchet and was regarded by Boekhout (I.c.) as a
form of H. helodes. 3) Cystidia in addition to the typical ones broadly clavate to capitate,
with heads up to 12(—16) µm broad; distinguished by Boekhout (I.c.) as H. helodes var.
capitatum prov. Until the study of extensive material shows the contrary, we consider
these as taxonomically insignificant variants.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bruchet (1970) used the name H. velutipes for the present species. He apparently did
not know H. helodes J. Favre because he did not mention it explicitly. Two collections of
H. helodes J, Favre, one of them being the lectotype (collection G. K. 9/39, 30 Aug. 1939,
Tourbiére du sentier, Herb. G.), the other collected and identified by the author (collection
G.K. 7721, 29 Sept. 1941, Haut Marais des Pleiades, Herb. G.), have been studied here
in order to compare some of the microscopic characters (Fig. 5). The spores differed
somewhat between the two collections, and were (9.3—)9.6-10.0(—10.7) x (4.9-)5-
5.5(-5.7) µm, Q = 1.7-1.9, av. Q = 1.8 and (10.4-)10.5-11.7(-12.5) x (5.3-)5.4-
5.9(-6.0) µm, Q = 1.9-2.1, av. Q = 2.0 respectively, narrowly amygdaloid, perispore
loosening in part of the spores, ornamentation consisting of fine warts, pale brown in am-
monia 10%. Cheilocystidia 35-65 x 4-5 µm, in majority cylindrical with more or less
capitate apex, 7-11 µm wide, sometimes slightly ventricose at the base, some slightly
thick-walled. These collections show in our opinion sufficient similarities with the collec-
tions described here to justify the name H. helodes. Consequently we consider H.velutipes
Bruchet as a later synonym of H. helodes.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Probably, this common species has been included by most authors in H. crustulini-

[@The name Hebeloma longicaudum was rejected by Boekhout (1982: 97), but on the
basis of an incorrect interpretation of the rules of nomenclature. He compared his descrip-
tion with Fries' description in Epicrisis (1838: 181), but that is not relevant from a nomen-
clatural point of view. Fries sanctioned Agaricus longicaudus in 1821 (: 248) on the basis
of Persoon's diagnosis from 1801 (: 332), which consequently should be regarded as the
basis for (neo)typification. Both descriptions differ considerably from the concept in the
Epicrisis. Agaricus longicaudus Pers. fits the present fungus well (although the descrip-
tion is very short and therefore an irrefutable interpretation cannot be given). The combi-
nation of a pale leather-coloured pileus, a white, cylindrical stipe and punctate lamellae
(due to dried excreted droplets!) suggests a Hebeloma near H. crustuliniforme. The small
pileus and slender stipe exclude H. crustuliniforme sensu stricto. It should be noted that
Persoon's description concerns a slender variant (pileus + 40 mm, stipe + 100 x 4-6
mm), as depicted by Lange (1938: 119E). However, more thick-set variants are equally
wide spread and represent in our opinion the same taxon. This interpretation of Agaricus
longicaudus is in agreement with widely accepted interpretations by Konrad & Maublanc
(1924-1937: pl. 79), J. Lange (l.c.) and Bruchet (1970: 77).#Misc-exposition*]

[@For descriptions of Mycena aetites the reader is referred to Kühner (1938) and Maas

to identify this species. In the field, however, it may show much resemblance with vari-
ants of the very common M. leptocephala (Pers.) Gill. which sometimes has a hardly per-
ceptible chlorine-like smell, especially during cold and wet weather. Moreover, inodorous
variants of both species seem to exist (Maas Geesteranus, l.c.). Field characters to sepa-
rate M. aetites from M. leptocephala are among other things: 1) the stouter habit, 2) the
more rigid consistency, and 3) the more broadly adnate lamellae that are usually paler grey
in M. aetites. In mycocoenological work, one is forced to identify large numbers of carpo-
phores so that it is impossible to check every carpophore under the microscope. In this
study, small specimens of M. aetites might have been mistaken for M. leptocephala in
some cases.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Typical Mycena filopes with grey-brown pileus with a pale margin is common and
well-known. Another taxon exists which is more or less similar (Arnolds, 1982: 409 f.f.)
except for the pink pileus. It is called Mycena filopes var. metata (Fr.) ss. Oort (Arnolds,
1982) or M. metata (Fr.) Kumm. ss. Oort.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although all intermediates exist between a grey-brown, pinkish grey-brown, greyish
pink and pink pileus, the extremes seem to be rather different in several aspects. How
subtle the difference in colour can be, is illustrated when fig. 7a (third fruit-body) and fig.
7b (first fruit-body) by Arnolds (1982) are compared. Minor differences between these
two taxa, apart of those given by Arnolds (l.c.), are: 1) the greyish taxon has a more (nar-
rowly) parabolical pileus, the pinkish taxon has a slightly more campanulate-expanded
pileus; 2) in the greyish taxon the dark colours in the centre of the pileus are more contrast-
ing to the pale whitish colour of the margin; 3) the greyish taxon tends to grow solitary
while the pinkish form usually occurs in groups of for instance 5—10 carpophores in an
arca of 1 dm?. These characters are correlated, but in each character intergradations seem
possible. The possibility to distinguish the taxa by using differences in the shape of the
cheilocystidia, as proposed by Maas Geesteranus (1980), was rejected by Arnolds (l.c.).
We support this last view and therefore recognize them as varieties, named var. filopes
and var. metata, respectively.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Maas Geesteranus (1984) proposed another distinction of the species of this group,
mainly on the basis of differences in the cheilocystidia and of the excrescences on top
of them. Maas Geesteranus (l.c.) suggested that Mycena sepia consists of two different
taxa: M. sepia J. Lange (considered as synonymous with M. filopes) and M. sepia ss.
Lundell, named M. septentrionalis Maas G. The differences between M. metata and
M. filopes were extensively elaborated, but many of the characters mentioned seem vari-
able.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena vitrea has been distinguished in this study from M. filopes on account of two
macroscopic characters, viz. the dark pileus with only slightly paler, not contrasting mar-
gin and the somewhat stouter habit. Using the key presented by Maas Geesteranus (1980),
the problem arose that the cheilocystidia did not agree entirely with one of the described
and depicted types, owing to their great variation even within one lamella. This renders
cheilocystidia morphology a character of limited value. Therefore we refrained from the
use of cystidial characters and we agree with Arnolds (1982) who came to the same con-
clusion. Arnolds (l.c.) noted that in his collections of M. filopes 1896 had a majority of
4-spored basidia whercas in M. sepia 82% of the collections was 4-spored. Consequent-
ly, this feature cannot be used as a distinctive character, at most as an additional character
in case of doubt.#Misc-exposition*]

[@It seems that still some confusion exists about this extremely common taxon. It is dif-
ficult to identify with the aid of the Psathyrella-monograph by Kits van Waveren (1985),
owing to differences between his descriptions and drawings of the pleurocystidia and the
pleurocystidioid chcilocystidia (‘lageniform or fusoid’) and the usual shape of these cells.
The cystidia are usually more or less ventricose with a rounded cylindrical apical part, as
figured by Arnolds (1982: 438, sub nomine P. trivialis) and in Fig. 19 of the present study.
They may be called (narrowly) utriform or obtusely fusiform. Consequently, this species
may therefore also be placed in sect. Spadiceogriseae, subsect. Lutenses. The macroscop-

[@These collections differ in several respects from previous descriptions. Ricken (1915),
Orton (1969), Geesink (1972), Guzman (1983), and Watling & Gregory (1987) described
or illustrated this species with a more or less hemispherical or paraboloid pileus. Only
Guzmán (1.c.) mentioned that older specimens become applanate or depressed. The speci-
mens described here very soon become applanate. The lamellae in our collections are not
exclusively broadly adnate but also sometimes narrowly adnate. The same is drawn by
Geesink (I.c.). The habitat is described as manure or arable fields (Ricken (I.c.), Watling
& Gregory (I.c.), Guzman (I.c.)), bonfire places (Geesink, l.c.), other organic debris
(Watling & Gregory (1.c.), Guzmán (1.c.)). Only the last author and Orton (l.c.) explicit-
ly mentioned dung as habitat. The specimens described here grew on (old) horse dung.
Arnolds (1982) regarded P. bullacea as a synonym of P. montana, in our opinion incor-
rectly so. Differences between these species arc, besides the habitat: the generally stouter
habit and the presence of whitish dentate veil remnants at the margin of the pileus of the
former species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Since there exists some confusion with regard to the delimitation of Russula decipiens,
R. maculata and, to a lesser extent, R. veternosa, a description is given of this species.
The colours of the pileus of R. maculata and R. decipiens show large overlap, although the
red colours tend to fade more often in the latter species. The greyish or brownish discol-
oration of the flesh is often difficult to assess with certainty. Both species seem to occur in
the same habitats. The main difference is the presence of numerous large pileocystidia in
R. decipiens, whereas these are smaller and less abundant in R. maculata.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula veternosa is macroscopically rather similar, but differs among other things in a
paler spore print. Of these three species R. decipiens seems to be the most common in the
Netherlands.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula graveolens Romell in Britz. — Figs. 25-29#Nomenclature*]

[@Many problems arose with the identification of taxa within the R. xerampelina complex,
which is well-characterized by the green reaction of the context with FeSO,, the fishy
smell and the brown discoloration of stipe and lamellae. Many characters show a large
variation in this group. However, often the extremes of a certain character are connected
by intermediates (although these intermediates seem to be less frequent than the ‘extreme’
variants) and none of the characters studied appear to be mutually correlated. Thus, fol-
lowing the criteria proposed by Kuyper (1988): at least two independent characters must
be present to separate one species from another, it would be impossible to maintain a spe-
cific status for many of the variants observed during this study.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand, the intuitive feeling exists that it is hardly realistic to unite such dif-
ferent variants into one species. In modern literature (Moser, 1983; Romagnesi, 1967;

[@ences in species concepts in this group. Before Romagnesi’s (1967) monograph the different
variants were usually considered as varieties of one variable species (e.g. Schaeffer,
1952) which is in our opinion still the best taxonomic solution except for some character-
istic and constant taxa like R. xerampelina (Schaeff.) Fr., R. pascua (Meller) J. Schaeff.
and R. faginea Romagn., which deserve the rank of species. In order to give the possibil-
ity to compare the present data with other studies, some names proposed in the modern
literature will be adopted here.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Romagnesi (1967) was the first one who tried to disentangle tentatively and eloquently
the species of the R. xerampelina complex. Generally, he has been followed by the later
authors except Moser (1983), who presented only a very brief key for the Xerampelinae.#Misc-exposition*]

[@On the other hand Bon (1988) presents a large number of taxa (39 species and vari-
eties!) based on minute differences. The result of such extensive splitting must be that
different names will be in vogue with different mycologists or groups of mycologists for
the same taxon, each of them forced to find small differences in their own way. This pro-
cedure renders many mycological data, which are usually not provided with descriptions
of the collections presented, of diminished value.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In this study the taxonomic classification by Einhellinger (1985) has been followed,
which is based on Romagnesi (1967), but some doubtful ‘species’ were discarded. The
taxa named here can be recognized only by macroscopical characters like the colour of the
pileus, size and consistence of the fruit-body.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other macroscopic characters like colour of the stipe (with/without red), discoloration
of the flesh and stipe (always brownish), reaction with FeSO4, smell, and separability of
the cutis are more or less constant throughout the material or vary widely within collec-
tions and do not correlate with any other character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The colour of the spore print generally is an important character in Russula. However,
it appeared that within this group there was only little variation in the collections studied;
sporeprints varied between IId-IIIa( —IIIc) according to the system of Romagnesi (I.c.).
Unfortunately, spore prints were not produced by many young, old and damaged carpo-
phores. Study of more material might show some value of this character.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Microscopic characters appear to be remarkably constant throughout the material. This
is true for the spores (shape, size, properties of the ornamentation), the dermatocystidia
(shape, size, number of septa) and hyphae in the epicutis. So it appears that these charac-
ters, which are normally so useful in the study of the genus Russula, fail largely in this
particular group.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In view of the observed patterns of variation in the collections studied, it is in our opin-
ion not possible to distinguish taxa in the rank of species, bearing in mind the criteria used
by Kuyper (1988). In this context the taxa observed should be considered as formac: taxa
where (single) character differences show limited intergradation.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Probably speciation within the Xerampelina-group is going on at present and has in
most cases not yet resulted in morphologically well-defined species (with some excep-
tions, mentioned above). Therefore the taxa described here are distinguished as formae
of R. graveolens Romell in Britzelmayer (1893), the oldest available species epithet in this
group. There is no indication that the older name R. barlae Quél. belongs to the group
of R. xerampelina and this name is rejected as a nomen dubium, in agreement with e.g.
Krieglsteiner (1987: 24).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Russula cicatricata was described by Romagnesi (1967: 694) as a species ad interim,
without Latin diagnosis and therefore invalidly published. Romagnesi (I.c.) stated that the
concentric furrows in combination with olive colours and a certain amount of ampulliform
hyphae in the cutis are characteristic for R. cicatricata. This seems to be a solid base for a
species, but according to our observations these characters are not reliable. The concentric
furrows or cracks have been found only once (collection 87074) and it seems to be a
character which develops in dry weather conditions. Marchand (1977) also indicated that
this character can be variable, even in specimens of one collection, and that the character
may disappear after collecting.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The greenish colour is the most striking feature, but this colour can be mixed with a
purple hue. It is clear that carpophores of this species can contain various quantities of
purple pigment; the more purple pigment present, the more brownish the pileus. On the
other hand, in forma graveolens, the pileus usually is purple red-brown, and can contain a
variable proportion of olive or brownish colours. Such intermediates with colour of the
pileus between greenish and purplish, are a minority among the studied collections. Occa-
sionally, one can find purple and green carpophores so close together that one has to as-
sume that they originate from the same mycelium. In the present material the hyphae of the
cutis are usually cylindrical, but in two collections a small minority is inflated (collections
88162 and 88/47). This character occasionally also occurs in specimens which have been
called f. graveolens and f. purpurata on account of the colour of the pileus.#Misc-exposition*]

able under all circumstances, and it is especially difficult to separate it from f. graveolens.

[@Russula parazurea proved to be very variable with respect to colour and surface of the
pileus, more so than generally acknowledged in literature. Typically, the pileus is dark
blue-greenish grey and pruinose. Frequently, specimens with violet or brick-red (e.g.
Expo F44, C43; like the colour of Russula vesca) pileus can be found. In direct sunshine
the original colour may fade to shiny yellowish, buff or straw-colour. Late in the season,
from November onwards, the cutis becomes cracked, morc or less like R. virescens, and
then shows often brownish or violaceous colours.#Misc-exposition*]
[@118 PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part I, 1995#Page-header*]

[@The grey sporocarps preferably grow on or along footpaths in forests or on other shady
places. The brick-red variants seem to prefer open habitats. The cracked cutis is only ob-
served in places where other forms have been found before, and is consequently consid-
ered as a variant, induced by low temperatures.#Misc-exposition*]

[@All variants are considered as caused by environmental conditions and hence without
taxonomic significance.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The species is relatively constant in microscopical characters with as most important
feature the spore ornamentation which consists of warts in rows or crests, connected with
lines, forming a more or less closed network. Among the related species in the subsection
Griseinae this species has the most obviously reticulate spore ornamentation, In addition,
the dermatocystidia often show a characteristic subapical constriction. In the field the lack
of any pink colour in the stipe and the yellowish cream colour of the lamellae may help the
identification.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We agree with Bon (1984) and Marchand (1986) to consider Tricholoma scalpturatum

the pale colour of the pileus in the latter. The microscopical features are more or less iden-
tical according to Bon (1.c.) and Marchand (1.c.). However, Moser (1978) gives different
spore-sizes: 5-6(-7) x 3-4 µm and 7-9 x 4-5 µm respectively. The spores of this col-

[@Kühner & Romagnesi (1953: 243) distinguish three ‘small’ species within Naucoria

(1982) followed this concept, although doubting whether the specific rank is deserved
here. He changed the names in Tubaria furfuracea s.str., T. hiemalis and T. romagne-
siana. After our experience the diagnostic characters (shape of cheilocystidia: capitate or
not; very slight differences in spore-size; width of the hyphae in the trama of the lamellae)
show large overlap. Even within one single fruit-body cheilocystidia may be found either
of the *hiemalis' -type (capitate) or cylindrical-clavate or irregularly cylindrical. Therefore,
we prefer to consider Tubaria furfuracea as one, rather variable, species.#Misc-exposition*]

in spore-size: collection 88324 has spores of 3.5—4.0 x 3.0—3.4 µm, collection 88244 of

Persoon (1801) is very short: “magna cespitosa contorta umbrina". Boudier (1905—1910)
and Bresadola (1927-1933) used the name O. wnbrina for the small-spored taxon (spores#Misc-exposition*]

Maas Geesteranus (1967) mentioned O. umbrina as a (possible, Maas Geesteranus) syn-
onym under the large-spored O. cochleata (spores 16-18 x 7-8 µm and 17.7-20.7 x
9.9-10.8 µm respectively). It is clear that Persoon's very briefly described P. umbrina
variously has been interpreted and in the absence of authentic material better can be regard-
ed as a nomen dubium. The material found during the present study fits well with the
small-spored species and is therefore called Otidea bufonia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@GYROPORUS AMMOPHILUS, A NEW POISONOUS BOLETE
FROM THE IBERIAN PENINSULA#Misc-exposition*]

[@M.L. CASTRO! & L. FREIRE?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Gyroporus ammophilus, à poisonous bolete occurring in Pinus woods on sandy soils along
the western Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, originally published as a variety of G. cas-
taneus, is formally raised to the rank of species. The distinguishing characters of Gyroporus
ammophilus are given against G. castaneus (Bull.: Fr.) Quél. The new species causes severe
gastroenteritis when consumed.#Abstract*]

[@Along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula a bolete has frequently been collected that
initially has been identified as Gyroporus castaneus (Bull.: Fr.) Quél. However, neither
the shape nor the colour of the pileus fit well with the original description (Quélet, 1886),
nor with later descriptions by modern authors such as Watling (1970), Gründ & Harrison
(1976), Moser (1983), and Alessio (1984). Morcover, several habitual consumers of the
edible Gyroporus castaneus suffered from strong and long-lasting gastroenteritis (during
6 to 8 days). some hours after they have ingested specimens of this unknown boletc.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A microscopic study of a few specimens proved that our collections were very similar
to Gyroporus castaneus. After consulting Dr. Alessio, we decided therefore to publish our
material on the rank of variety as G. castaneus var. ammophilus (Castro & Freire, 1989).#Misc-exposition*]

[@However, the analysis of a great number of additional samples, from different popula-
tions and during several years, revealed that the shape and size of pleuro- and cheilocysti-
dia, as well as size of the spores differ significantly from those of Gyroporus castaneus.
Moreover, ammonia applied to the cap cuticle of our taxon produces a positive reaction
(reddish brown after 5 min.), in contrast to Gyroporus castaneus which does not show
any reaction with this reagens. Table I gives a comparison of the diagnostic characters of
both species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The ecology of our taxon is constant as it has always been found along the Atlantic
coast on fixed dunes in association with Pinus spp., or, less frequently with other trees
and shrubs, such as Quercus suber and Cistus salviaefolius, on sandy soils with great
lixiviation and basic pH (up to 9 in water).#Misc-exposition*]

[@For all these reasons we propose here that our material should be considered a species
of its own right, different from Gyroporus casta , typical of the Adantic-Mediterranean
region of the Iberian Peninsula.#Misc-exposition*]

devoted to fungal cells and vegetative growth, spore dormancy and dispersal, genetic var-

[@This field guide is available in two different sizes: a pocket edition, that is handy to take
into the field, and a large-sized edition, suitable for the library. All together 1751 species
have been depicted on 160 coloured plates, mainly higher basidiomycetes (Agaricales and
Gastromycetes) and a few Aphyllophorales (30 spp.) and Ascomycetes (46 spp.). The
illustrations are of high standard, and in many cases fairly representative for the species.
One of the very good facets of this book is the relative completeness in many genera. For
example, 164 species of Russula have been depicted, 100 Lactarius-species, 62 Hygro-
cybe-species etc. The species descriptions are short, and contain only the characteristic
macroscopical features. Distribution data are given, as well as the red-list status of many
species. The book also contains chapters on mycology, the system used, and extensive
keys, in which not only the depicted species are treated, but in addition some 1300 other
taxa, so the total number of species treated is around 3000. Unfortunately the keys use#Misc-exposition*]

tends to be rather narrow, and in some cases several species are keyed out and depicted

small shortcomings, this field guide will prove to be one of the best available in the
French language.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This new series aims to give in the form of a loose-leaf edition in annual consignments of
100 pp. and 60 coloured plates a reference work for ‘Micromycetes’. As such it claims to fill
a gap in literature, since identification keys for this group of fungi are said to be widely
available, but photographic illustrations of many taxa are seemingly lacking. This first part
is devoted to a number of taxa in Myxomycetes, here considered to belong to the Micro-
mycetes, which is disputable. The photographs are generally of good quality. Although in
brackets the maker of the photographs is indicated, the editor fails to indicate reference to
descriptions, material and literature, which makes the work less valuable than it claims to
be. To the opinion of the reviewer, this kind of atlases only can be really valuable if the
illustrations should refer to original descriptions and herbarium material cq. cultures, de-
posited in an official and accessible herbarium or culture collection. As such, the excellent
publication of Neubert et al., 1993, discussed in Persoonia 15 (4) offers a much better re-
ference book for Myxomycetes, combining excellent photography with keys, descriptions

[@Mr Kelderman is an esteemed amateur mycologist, who is mainly working in the area of
South Limburg, a region rich in Lepiotaceous fungi which grow in the sun-lit thermophil-
ous forests on calcareous loam present in the area. Also the mining activities in the area
created waste-heaps, which are now abandoned and partly covered with scattered trees,
which provide habitats for rare species of Lepiota s.1. After the introductory chapters on
the habitats and the methods used, 61 species, 6 varieties and 1 forma are treated in the
genera Lepiota, Melanophyllum, Cystolepiota, Sericeomyces, Leucocoprinus and Leuco-
agaricus. All taxa are described in the form of lengthy descriptions and elaborate drawings
of basidiocarps and relevant microscopical structures. Data are also given on ecology,
distribution, and phenology. All species are keyed out in dichotomic keys, and at the end
of the book distribution maps are given, a list of references, and an index to all treated
taxa. The book is printed on recycled paper, which unfortunately lead to a poor repro-
duction of the beautifully designed illustrations. It is bound in hard-cover of good quality.
