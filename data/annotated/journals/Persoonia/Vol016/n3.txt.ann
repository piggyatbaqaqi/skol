[@STUDIES IN COPRINUS IV - COPRINUS SECTION COPRINUS
Subdivision and revision of subsection Alachuani#Misc-exposition*]

[@C.B. ULJÉ! & M.E. NOORDELOOS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus section Coprinus is defined and delimited to comprise four subsections: Atramen-
tarii, Coprinus, Lanatuli and Alachuani. A key to the subsections is given as well as a key
to the species of subsection Alachuani known from the Netherlands or to be expected in the
Netherlands on account of records from neighbouring countries. Three new species, Copri-
nus epichloeus, Coprinus fluvialis and Coprinus sclerotiorum are described as well as a new
variety of C. urticicola: var. salicicola. In addition the following species are fully described:
C. argenteus, C. echinosporus, C. episcopalis, C. filamentifer, C. friesii, C. gonophyllus,
C. goudensis, C. herinkii, C. kimurae, C. kubickae, C. luteocephalus, C. phaeosporus,
C. phlyctidosporus, C. picaceus, C. piepenbroekii, C. pseudofriesii, C. rugosobisporus,
C. spilosporus, C. stanglianus, C. strossmayeri, C. tigrinellus, C. urticicola, C. vermi-
culifer, C. xantholepis, and C. xenobius.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This paper is a result of our observations on Coprinus subsect. Alachuani, and is a con-
tinuation of earlier papers (Uljé & Bas, 1988, 1991; Uljé & Noordeloos, 1993), also in
connection with the preparation of a manuscript for the Flora agaricina neerlandica. All
species currently known from the Netherlands and neighbouring countries are fully de-
scribed and some new species are added. To draw attention to some still undescribed
species, of which insufficient good material is available at present, some taxa are de-
scribed here as Coprinus spec. and identified with some combination of the collector's
name, a collection number, a location and a date.#Misc-exposition*]

[@PRESENTATION#Misc-exposition*]

[@All collections are deposited in the Rijksherbarium, Leiden (L), unless otherwise
indicated. Collections made by the first author, but without a collection number, refer to
material that has not been conserved.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The information on the distribution in the Netherlands is based on the first author's ob-
servations and is not necessarily reflected in the number of collections studied.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Type studies which form the base of the present species concepts have been published
in an earlier paper (Uljé & Noordeloos, 1996).#Misc-exposition*]

[@INFRAGENERIC DELIMITATION OF COPRINUS WITH REGARD TO SECTION COPRINUS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In an earlier paper (Uljé & Noordeloos, 1993) the authors presented their view on the
infrageneric classification of the genus Coprinus, resulting in a key to the sections. In this
concept, three sections are recognized: sect. Coprinus, characterized by the presence of a
filamentous veil, sect. Pseudocoprinus, accommodating species without a veil or a very
minute veil in combination with pileocystidia, and sect. Veliformes for those taxa that
have a veil that, at least partly, is composed of globose elements. This classification dif-
fers from that of Singer (1986), who distinguished four sections: sect. Coprinus, which is
similar to our concept of the same name, sect. Micacei and sect. Cyclodei, which together
approximate our concept of sect. Veliformes, and sect. Hemerobii, for taxa without veil or
with veil in combination with setulae on the pileus, which agrees with our sect. Pseudo-
coprinus. Like Singer (l.c.) we distinguish four subsections in sect. Coprinus, mainly based
on characters of the veil: subsect. Coprinus (7 Annulati Lange, 1915), subsect. Atramen-
tarii (Fr.) Konr. & Maubl. (1930), subsect. Alachuani Sing. (1948), and subsect. Lana-
tuli Sing. (1986).#Misc-exposition*]
[@Uljé & Noordeloos: Studies in Coprinus - IV 267#Page-header*]

[@Citerin (1992, 1994) distinguishes similar groups in the genus Coprinus, but treats them
on subgeneric instead of sectional level. As a result Citerin has four sections in ‘subgenus’
Coprinus, which he calls Coprinus (2 Comati Fr.), Atramentarii (Fr.) Penn. in Kf., Lana-
tuli (Fr.) "Penn. in Kf.", and Picacei (Fr.) Penn. in Kf. (Citerin obviously was unaware
that Pennington did not use the Friesian name Lanatuli but called the group Lanulati
(Kauffman, 1918: 207, 220)).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Other authors usually place the taxa with diverticulate veil (our subsect. Alachuani) in
different sections. Pilát & Svréek (1967: 386) and Redhead & Traquair (1981) put the
grass-inhabiting species around Coprinus friesii in section Herbicolae. Kühner & Romag-
nesi (1953, *groupe' /mpexi) keep the species with diverticulate veil together, forming the
basis of Singer's (and our) sectional concept. Moser (1983: 253) places all species with
veil made up of elongate elements, including species without diverticulate veil, in one
group, but without indicating a formal taxonomic rank.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subsect. Lanatuli is also considered as a distinct section by several authors (Van De
Bogart, 1979; Citerin, 1992). In our concept subsection Coprinus is reserved for those taxa
that have a narrow, loose annulus that can easily be shifted along the lower part of the stipe.
So far only two taxa have been accepted in this subsection, viz. Coprinus comatus and
C. sterquilinus, and the subsection needs revision.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Subsection Atramentarii contains species with a scarce veil, which is not easily removed
from the pileus. Such taxa grow in bundles (Coprinus atramentarius, C. acuminatus and
C. insignis). These macroscopical characters are the main reasons to keep the Atramentarii
separate from the Alachuani, since there are hardly any convincing microscopical differ-
ences. Future studies will prove whether our present view must be adjusted. In connection
with the nomenclatural aspect of the sectional name Arramentarii it is interesting to note
that the authors of this name, Konrad & Maublanc (1930), erroneously indicated the pres-
ence of an annulus as character for subsect. Atramentarii instead of for subsect. Volvati
in which they placed Coprinus comatus and C. sterquilinus. However this is without no-
menclatural consequences.#Misc-exposition*]

form of hairy-floccose covering of the basidiocarp or in patches scattered over the surface.
Veil consisting of elongate, filamentous elements, which are smooth, thin-walled or diver-
ticulate and then often thick-walled. In some species of subsection Lanatuli a few globose
or cllipsoid cells may also be present in the veil. Pileipellis made up of repent, clongate,
often inflated hyphae, which are smooth or branched and diverticulate.#Description*]

made up of weakly to strongly diverticulate, and then often thick-walled clements. Stipe
smooth, but in most cases covered with very small velar flocks, especially at base.#Description*]

[@Macroscopical characters#Description*]

[@Most species very small to small with stipes less than 3 mm thick; sometimes medium-
sized to rather large with up to 6 resp. 10 mm thick stipe. Veil present in all species, cov-
ering the whole pileus of young specimens in most cases, but breaking up in patches or in
small, radially arranged, hairy flocks while pileus expands. Lamellae crowded, about 20
in the smallest specimens, up to 60 and more in larger ones, free with no space between
place of attachment and stipe; white in very young stages, soon becoming grey, often with
brown tinge, finally dark grey or black spotted in small species to black in medium-sized
species. Stipe hollow in all species, whitish, equal or slightly tapering towards apex; with
equal or somewhat thickened, clavate or — in a few species — more or less bulbous base;
with minute remnants of velar flocks, particularly towards base. One species develops on
sclerotia. Smell of pileus not specific but in C. strossmayeri the rhizomorphs have a dis-
tinct smell. Spore print black with a very slightly violaceous or purple tinge. This could
be an additional character for the whole group, but since it is almost impossible to make a
spore print from the small and fragile basidiocarps of many taxa in sect. Alachuani, infor-
mation on the colour of the spore-print is lacking.#Description*]

[@Microscopical characters#Description*]

[@Characteristic for the species in subsect. Alachuani is the structure of the veil, as indi-
cated in the introduction and key to the subsections. The veil is composed of filamentous
hyphae that are weakly to strongly diverticulate. This means that most hyphae have wart-
or finger-like excrescences. Sometimes these excrescences are branched again, which we
call multiple-branched in this paper.#Description*]

[@The size of the basidiocarps in the two Scottish collections mentioned in the original

two species are discussed further following the description of Coprinus luteocephalus.)#Misc-exposition*]

[@The macroscopical description is based on Watling (I.c.). Coprinus luteocephalus is
microscopically close to C. xenobius (for differences, see the discussion under C. xeno-
bius). In subsect. Alachuani the only other species with oblong spores is C. goudensis
and that species grows on wood, the spores are distinctly smaller and the cystidia are el-
lipsoid or subcylindrical, never utriform.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The status of the studied material is not clear. The envelope of Watling 7360 was emp-
ty, and the available material originates from a culture by Kemp. It seems likely that the
culture was made from the holotype material, but the original description mentions another
collection by Kemp (England: Cumberland, Wigton, without date), which could have been
the source of the culture.#Misc-exposition*]

above description because of the poor macroscopical annotation. The sizes of the spores
agree with those of C. luteocephalus but are somewhat narrower. Not noted are the colour
and size of the pileus. The collection was labelled C. xenobius but that species has much
larger spores.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The yellow colour and smaller spores should distinguish Coprinus luteocephalus from
C. xenobius, but the Italian collections cited under C. xenobius have spores characteristic
for C. luteocephalus while the basidiocarps lack the characteristic yellow tinges. This could
mean that Coprinus luteocephalus may somctimes lack yellow tinges, and then only the
spore-size is left to distinguish it from C. xenobius. It seems likely that one, variable tax-
on is involved but we need more material to confirm this.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus kimurae can be recognised by the subglobose to broadly ellipsoid spores, the
absence of clamp-connections, the rather large basidiocarps, the veil breaking up in patches
(similar to C. picaceus) and the habitat.#Diagnosis*]

[@Considering the occurrence indoors in (heated) greenhouses, and outdoors in places
like compost heaps and on rotten coconut-fibre fabric, it is likely that Coprinus kimurae is
a thermophilic fungus. In the Netherlands it is found in greenhouses, although the species
has been found outdoors on a coconut matting (in a sheltered garden) and there is one re-
cording from a compost heap, which probably was in a greenhouse.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In earlier publications (Uljé, 1995a: 11 and Uljé, 1995b: 119) the first author consider-
ed that C. kubickae was synonymous with C. kimurae, but further study has indicated that
this opinion was wrong. Coprinus kubickae is a very small species with veil breaking up
in very small flocks and not in patches, with on average somewhat smaller spores, nar-
rower elements of veil, presence of clamp-connections and a habitat which is clearly dif-
ferent.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus strossmayeri is recognizable in the field by the rather large basidiocarps grow-
ing in clumps like C. atramentarius but in contrast to that almost smooth species the young
specimens of C. strossmayeri are covered with thick, white veil breaking up in small,
felty scales when pileus expands. These scales are somewhat larger than the flocculose
scales of species in subsect. Domestici (sect. Micacei) and more persistent. The basidio-
carps of C. strossmayeri are more slender and more conical when mature. The base of the
stipe in C. strossmayeri is connected to dense, dark orange-brown rhizomorphs with strong
smell of mould. Microscopically C. strossmayeri is distinguished from species in subsect.

[@Coprinus urticicola is a common species in hay-fields with abundant dead grasses; also
rather common in Phragmites lands. The species can be recognized by the small, pure
white basidiocarps with woolly scales of veil. Microscopically the often conical, ellipsoid
or ovoid, pale coloured spores and thin-walled elements of veil are good characters to
identify Coprinus urticicola. The microscopical characters of the types of Coprinus melo
and C. suburticicola are similar to those of C. urticicola, and these species are therefore
considered synonyms. Since the description of Coprinus brassicae Peck (1890: 64) also
agrees very well with C. urticicola, this species is also listed among the synonyms.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus gonophyllus can be recognized by the rather firm, usually hemispherical basi-
diocarps which often grow on burnt places and the thin-walled, narrowly velar hyphae
and the short, subglobose spores with truncate germ pore. The size of the spores is some-
what similar to that of Coprinus spilosporus, but that species has long, thick-walled hairs
between the velar elements. Another taxon, named Coprinus spec. Bas 5002 in the present
paper, is close to C. gonophyllus but differs in smaller, (sub)globose spores with an
apical papilla (limoniform). Coprinus epichloeus is a much smaller and fragile species
with spores which are not distinctly truncate at apex.#Misc-exposition*]

wide), the ellipsoid, ovoid or rhomboid spores up to c. 9 or 10 µm in length and the
rather large basidiocarps. Coprinus pseudofriesii differs from C. friesii by the larger basi-

C. phaeosporus by the not distinctly lentiform, more ellipsoid spores with central germ
pore. Coprinus xantholepis has much larger cystidia.#Diagnosis*]

the dark brown (sepia) veil on the pileus, this may be less distinctly developed. The dis-

[@Coprinus subtigrinellus is considered here a synonym of C. tigrinellus. A study of the
holotype of Coprinus subtigrinellus showed that the spores are rather small for typical
C. tigrinellus (5.3—7.2 x 4.2—5.5 µm), but the structure of the veil is similar to that of
C. tigrinellus and, in our opinion, provides adequate reason for not maintaining C. subti-
grinellus as a separate species.#Misc-exposition*]

Section Heterospora: Taxa with large sized conidial dimorphs,
in vivo sometimes as Stagonosporopsis synanamorphs#Misc-exposition*]

[@G.H. BOEREMA!, J. DEGRUYTER2 & M.E. NOORDELOOS?#Misc-exposition*]

[@The new section Heterospora is proposed for Phoma species producing not only relatively
small, mainly aseptate conidia, but also distinctly larger conidia, which may become 1- or
more septate: ‘ascochytoid-stagonosporoid’. The majority of the conidia are always pho-
moid in vitro, but in vivo they may be predominantly large and septate, synanamorphs
being therefore referred to Stagonosporopsis Died. The heterosporous species are described
in vitro, with additional data on the conidial morphology in vivo. An addendum deals with
eight species from other sections which display a similar conidial dimorphism. Five new
species and four new combinations have been proposed: Phoma actaeae spec. nov., Phoma
alectorolophi spec. nov., Phoma nigripycnidia spec. nov., Phoma subboltshauseri spec.
nov, and Stagonosporopsis dennisii spec. nov.; Phoma dennisii var. oculo-hominis (Punith.)
comb. nov., Stagonosporopsis aquilegiae (Rabenh.) comb. nov., Stagonosporopsis bo-
hemica (Kabát & Bubák) comb. nov. and Stagonosporopsis nigripycnidiicola (Ondtej)
comb. nov. Indices on host-fungus and fungus-host relations and a key to cultural character-
istics are included as well as short comments on their ecology and distribution.#Abstract*]

[@In the previous Contributions of this series — I. Section Phoma (de Gruyter & Noorde-
loos, 1992; de Gruyter et al., 1993), II. Section Peyronellaea (Boerema, 1993) and IIT.
Section Plenodomus (Boerema et al., 1994a, 1996) — the essentials for differentiating taxa
in the genus Phoma Sacc. in vitro were clearly described. In addition to major morpho-
logical characteristics, these may provide important secondary identification criteria, such
as the presence of chlamydospores, mycelial synanamorphs and the production of specific
metabolites. In vitro studies may also help with differentiation of species where charac-
teristics are either confusingly similar or widely variable.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The differentiation of the heterosporous species treated in this paper fully depends on
comparative studies in vitro where they are stable and unquestionably phomoid. Here
most pycnidia contain aseptate, hyaline conidia, generally measuring 3-11 x (1—-)1.5—-4
(-5) µm. However, the mature pycnidia often also contain some distinctly larger conidia,
usually (15—)20-25(-28) x 3.5-6(—7) µm. Similar large conidia are common in vivo but
their dimensions are more variable, (8—)11—30 (occ. 45—62) x (2.5-)3-8 (occ. 12-15)
µm. They may remain continuous, but often become two- or more-celled by secondary
septation (‘ascochytoid-stagonosporoid’).#Misc-exposition*]

[@The conidial dimorphism of these species has caused much taxonomic and nomen-
clatural confusion. Some species always produce a mixture of small and large conidia in#Misc-exposition*]

[@variable proportions in vivo, apparently influenced by growing conditions. These species
have been formerly referred to Phoma (*Phyllosticta’ on leaves), ‘Ascochyta’ or ‘Stagono-
spora’. Depending on the conditions in vivo, other species produce either only relatively
small aseptate conidia or mainly large, usually septate conidia. The latter phenotypes have
always been placed in ‘Ascochyta’ (‘Diplodina’ on stems) or *Stagonospora’, but in vitro
they show their phomoid identity. True species of Ascochyta Lib. and Stagonospora
(Sacc.) Sacc. always produce relatively large septate conidia in vitro similar to those in
vivo; this is connected with the wall-thickening septation of their conidia; see Boerema &
Bollen (1975: fig. 3 'distoseptation') and Boerema (1984: fig. 7). [The present generic
concepts of Phyllosticta Pers. and Diplodina Westend. differ from those previously ac-
cepted (based on ‘leaf and stem specificity’ e.g. see Sutton, 1980) and now encompass
species which used to be known in Phyllostictina H. Sydow and Discella Berk. & Br.]#Misc-exposition*]

[@The dominant ‘ascochytoid-stagonosporoid’ phenotypes shown by various hetero-
sporous Phomas in vivo, may be described as separate synanamorphs and then referred
to the genus Stagonosporopsis Diedicke (1912a: 141—142). The latter was originally
separated from Ascochyta on the basis of occasional multiseptate conidia (comp. Bucha-
nan, 1987: 8). Diedicke (l.c.: 141) indicated that seven species belonged to this genus.
The first species combination described, Stagonosporopsis actaeae (Allescher) Died.
(1.c.: 144), interpreted by many authors as the type species, represents the ‘ascochytoid-
stagonosporoid' phenotype of Phoma actaeae, no. 3 in this paper. Stagonosporopsis
boltshauseri (Sacc.) Died. (1912b: 397) chosen as lectotype by Clements & Shear (1931).
represents the *ascochytoid-stagonosporoid' phenotype of Phoma subboltshauseri, no. 9
in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The connection of these heterosporous species with Diedicke's Stagonosporopsis was
first noticed in the seventies (Boerema & Verhoeven, 1979: 150; Boerema & Dorenbosch,
1981). Their classification in a separate section of Poma was introduced only recently
(Boerema, Pieters & Hamers, 1993: 17 and Boerema, de Gruyter & Noordeloos, 1994b).
The section still needs to be formally proposed:#Misc-exposition*]

above, in most species in vivo the pycnidia contain either only small or mainly large coni-
dia (often differentiated as a Stagonosporopsis synanamorph).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Most species of the section are pathogens specific to particular hosts. The two types
of conidia may play different roles in the life cycle. Some species produce small conidia
especially on dead host material, whereas pycnidia with large conidia only develop in as-
sociation with disease symptoms. The large conidia generally develop with fluctuating hu-
midity and with desiccation, whereas only small conidia are often formed in humid condi-
tions. This may occur in the same pycnidium and appears to be reversible. Temperature
may also be important. Large conidia sometimes break (split) easily at the septa, and usu-
ally germinate more quickly than the smaller ones.#Misc-exposition*]

experimentally connected with a teleomorph, but in one case a single identity with a spe-
cies of Didymella Sacc. ex Sacc. is suggested.#Misc-exposition*]

[@The Addendum includes Phoma species which actually show the Heterospora conidial
dimorphism, but which are placed in other sections due to other characteristics. This re-
fers to three species of section Phyllostictoides (van der Aa et al., 1990), ordinarily pro-
ducing only relatively small septate conidia, but which sometimes also form large 'asco-
chytoid’ conidia; two species with dictyochlamydospores, already discussed under sec-
tion Peyronellaea (Boerema, 1993) and three species distinguished by thick-walled poroid
pycnidia, characteristic of the section Sclerophomella (compare de Gruyter & Noordeloos,
1992).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Finally it should be noted that a comparable Phoma/Stagonospora-like conidial dimor-
phism is recorded in anamorphs of some species of the Ascomycete genera Leptosphaeria
Ces. & de Not. and Phaeosphaeria Miyake (Sivanesan, 1984; Leuchtmann, 1984). How-
ever, in those anamorphs the relatively large septate conidial phenotype commonly domi-
nates, not only in vivo but also in vitro. Therefore they are usually only referred to Stago-
nospora (Sacc.) Sacc. char. emend. Leuchtmann (l.c.). Most of the *associated micro-
conidial forms', *Aposphaeria or Phoma-like' (Leuchtmann l.c.), do not have a specific
name, but one exception (Phoma meliloti Allescher) is discussed in the Addendum of Con-
tribution III-1 on Phoma taxa with a Leptosphaeria teleomorph (Boerema ct al., 1994a).#Misc-exposition*]

[@MATERIAL AND METHODS#Misc-exposition*]

[@The isolates and original samples studied were present in the collections of the Plant
Protection Service as freeze-dried cultures or herbarium specimens. The methodology ap-
plied conforms with that described in Contributions I-1 & 1-2 of this series (de Gruyter
& Noordeloos, 1992 and de Gruyter et al., 1993). The single identity of pycnidia with
only small aseptate conidia and pycnidia with large sized, mainly septate conidia was con-
firmed in vitro.#Misc-exposition*]

[@KEY TO THE SPECIES TREATED IN THIS PAPER
Differentiation based on characteristics in vitro

The distinguishing character of the heterosporous species treated in this paper, the
large sized conidial dimorph, is most conspicuous in vivo conditions. In vitro the conidia#Key*]
[@338#Page-header*]

[@PERSOONIA — Vol. 16, Part 3, 1997#Misc-exposition*]

[@are always mostly small and aseptate; large and septate conidia may be wanting, especially
in old isolates. Direct identification of these species in vitro is therefore often difficult.
Most heterosporous species are pathogens with a restricted host range and/or distribution.
Thus the host-fungus index on p. 341 including a code indicating conidial variability in
vivo, may be very helpful in identification of species.

[@Note. The German collection on leaves of Chelidonium majus studied by Bresadola
(1.c.) illustrates the influence of desiccation on the occurrence of Stagonosporopsis coni-
dia. In the pycnidia of the fresh collection apparently only phomoid conidia (*7-8 x 3 µm,
becoming 1-septate and 10—3.5 µm") were present, but during the drying process numer-
ous large, mainly septate (ascochytoid-stagonosporoid) conidia (13.5—23 x 4.5-5 µm,
in holotype; compare Diedicke l.c.) have developed. These changes have been observed
in reverse with a Dutch collection on leaves of Chelidonium majus: pycnidia with many
large, mainly septate conidia, contained numerous small phomoid conidia after 5 days
under humid conditions (single identity proved by conidial isolates).#Misc-exposition*]

[@Ecology and distribution. In Eurasia this fungus is frequently found in association
with dark leaf spots and stem lesions on wild and cultivated Aquilegia spp. (perennials),
especially A. vulgaris. However, it occurs also on other Ranunculaceae, e.g. perennial
Aconitum and Delphinium spp. In the United States it has been an important cause of
crown rot of cultivated Delphiniums (as Diplodina delphinii). In Japan the fungus has
recently caused severe damage on cultivated Aconitums (as Phoma aconiticola). The
Stagonosporopsis synanamorph is also recorded in Australasia (New Zealand). Phoma
aquilegiicola/S. aquilegiae differs from the related P. delphiniicola/S. delphinii (no. 8) by
faster growth rate, positive E-reaction and different shape and size of the conidia (compare
the figures 3A and 4A).#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Ecology and distribution. Most records of this fungus are on species of Delphinium
(inclusive Consolida) in Europe. In Russia it has also been reported from a species of
Aconitum (same tribus as Delphinium). The most common host seems to be Forking Lak-
spur, D. consolida (Consolida regalis). The fungus causes angular, often marginal, dark
leaf spots and appears as necrophyte on capsules and old stems. It closely resembles
Phoma aquilegiicola (synanam. Stagonosporopsis aquilegiae), no. 6 in this paper, which
also may occur on Delphinium and Aconitum spp. Phoma delphinii can be easily differen-
tiated in vitro from P. aquilegiicola by its slower growth rate, the negative E-reaction and
different shape and size of the conidia (compare the figures 3A and 4A).#Habitat-distribution*]

[@Note. Experiments by Sauthoff (1.c.) have shown that the phomoid aseptate conidia
develop at high humidity, whereas the large septate ascochytoid conidia are produced at
varying humidity and with desiccation. This links up with an observation we made in
vitro. In pycnidia of an old plate culture on OA the conidiogenous layer had many large
cylindrical cells resembling initials of the large conidial phenotype; however, wetting the
pycnidia, these cells became phialidic conidiogenous cells producing numerous small
aseptate conidia (Boerema & Bollen l.c.: fig. 6c). The large septate conidia germinated
much more quickly than the small aseptate conidia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Characters in vivo (Clematis spp.)#Description*]

[@Pycnidia (subepidermal in leaf spots, also in stem lesions and on dead stubs) may con-
tain conidia quite different in size. They are generally phomoid, but larger than those in
vitro, aseptate or I-septate, (6-)8-10(-13) x 3-4 µm (av. 9.5 x 3.2 µm). Sometimes,
however, the septate conidia are considerably larger, i.e. ascochytoid, (10—)12—22(—28)
x 4.5—6(—6.5) µm (av. 18.5 x 5.8 µm). In old pycnidia the conidia become dark and oc-
casionally 2-septate.#Description*]

[@First Coprinus lilatinctus, belonging to subsect. Glabri, is described as new. Secondly,
nomenclatural reasons are given for Coprinus nudiceps P.D. Orton to be replaced by the
older name C. schroeteri P. Karst. Type studies of both taxa are given and their syn-
onymy is discussed. To facilitate identification an updated key is given for the species in
subsect. Glabri.#Abstract*]

[@In 1982 the second author collected for the first time a taxon rather similar to Coprinus
leiocephalus P.D. Orton but with distinct lilac colours in the young specimens. This
character, and the fact that the basidiocarps were larger and more cylindrical than usual
in Coprinus leiocephalus, made a closer study of the specimens necessary and micro-
scopically a number of characters also proved to be different. The material was labelled
by Bender under the provisional herbarium name Coprinus lilatinctus, but not published.
A few years later the first author recognized the same species, but, at the time, took no
action to publish it. Now more material has been collected which confirms the constancy
of the differences from Coprinus leiocephalus, and we are convinced that we are dealing
with an undescribed species.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coprinus lilatinctus is a species rather close to C. leiocephalus P. D. Orton and C. plica-
tilis (Curt.: Fr.) Fr. It differs from both in shape, size and colour of the basidiocarps, size
of the spores, and the grey yellowish granules in the microscopical elements, though in dried
material the granules are not always clear. The shape of the spores is similar to that of
C. leiocephalus, but they are distinctly larger (av. length of spores in C. leiocephalus: 9.0—
10.7, in C. lilatinctus: 11.3—11.5 µm). In C. plicatilis the spores are more elongate and on
average, just as in C. leiocephalus, less than 9.5 (9.8) µm wide (in C. lilatinctus 9.5—10.1
µm). Coprinus nudiceps P.D. Orton agrees in spore size, but that species is smaller, lacks
lilaceous tints and never grows on wood-chips. However, the most important difference
is the shape of the spores which is rounded triangular in C. nudiceps and without the lemon-
shaped apex that is characteristic in C. lilatinctus, C. leiocephalus and C. plicatilis.#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the literature no colour illustrations of our new species are available.#Misc-exposition*]

[@ON COPRINUS NUDICEPS#Misc-exposition*]

[@In the past Coprinus nudiceps P.D. Orton has been described under several names
from different substrates (Uljé & Bas, 1988: 443). Until recently, the only species we had
studied, for which type material was available, was that of Coprinus nudiceps P.D. Orton
and we used that name for the taxon. The first author has now studied the type of Copri-
nus schroeteri P. Karst. and found the material identical to C. nudiceps except in the size
of the basidiocarps, which is smaller in C. schroeteri than commonly found in C. nudi-
ceps. However, the microscopical characters agree in all respects. Since the name of
Karsten has priority over Coprinus nudiceps, and also seems to be the oldest name that
may refer to this species (Uljé & Bas, 1988: 444) we introduce here the name Coprinus
schroeteri P. Karst. for C. nudiceps. The original diagnoses of both taxa are given below
and supplemented with data and illustrations obtained from the type-studies.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Although both Coprinus schroeteri and C. nudiceps are described from dung, the spe-
cies frequently is collected from soil. The colour of the basidiocarp differs according to
the substrate on which it has been collected: specimens from dung are generally yellowish
or nice ochre-brown, those from soil (generally in lawns) are usually somewhat darker
brown or red-brown. Because of this macroscopical difference there may appear to be two
taxa but both types are indistinguishable microscopically. In addition dark brown speci-
mens have also been found on dung. In our experience, other dung-inhabiting species
also tend to have yellow colours, possibly under the influence of the substrate, and the
character is, therefore, of restricted taxonomical value. We attach more importance to the
microscopical characters and, in the case of Coprinus schroeteri, we see no reason to keep
the yellowish specimens apart from the brown ones.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Colour photographs of C. schroeteri (as C. nudiceps) have been published by Bender &
Enderle (1988: opposite p. 48) and by Cacialli et al. (1995: 227).#Misc-exposition*]

[@BRYOSCYPHUS ATROMARGINATUS SPEC. NOV. (LEOTIACEAE),
A NEW ASCOMYCETE PARASITIZING THE THALLUS OF
MARCHANTIA POLYMORPHA#Misc-exposition*]

[@GERARD J. M. VERKLEY!, HUUB A. VAN DER AA! & GEERT W. DE COCK?#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bryoscyphus atromarginatus spec. nov. from dying thalli of Marchantia polymorpha is de-
scribed in vivo and in vitro. Differences with B. marchantiae and other representatives of
the genus are discussed. A key to the species of Bryoscyphus is given.#Abstract*]

[@The genus Bryoscyphus was erected by Spooner to accommodate four species of inoper-
culate discomycetes occurring on thalli of Bryophyta (Kirk & Spooner, 1984). The struc-
ture of the excipulum, the truncate apices of the asci and fusoid and frequently rhomboidal
ascospores are characteristic of the genus. Most species are known from few collections.
Recently, a fungus rapidly killing thalli of Marchantia polymorpha L. was collected in the
Netherlands. The anatomy of its excipulum is typical of Bryoscyphus, but it differs from
all known species of the genus, including B. marchantiae (Berk.) Spooner. The type col-
lection of B. marchantiae was in fact on Reboulia haemisphaerica (L.) Raddi (Kirk &
Spooner, 1984). The description given by Naumov (1964) of the collection he reported as
Hymenoscyphus marchantiae (Berk.) Dennis on M. polymorpha agrees well with the new
species proposed in this paper.#Misc-exposition*]

soon turn ochraceous, developing shades of rose and purple with age, most strikingly on

1995. From October till December the fungus occurred again with less apothecia.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Material of this species has apparently been collected from the same host by Benkert
(1981), who provisionally identified it as Hymenoscyphus marchantiae. Spooner (Kirk &

did not see any material on Marchantia polymorpha.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Bryoscyphus atromarginatus shares its distinctly stalked asci with Bryoscyphus mar-
chantiae and B. dicrani (Ade & Hóhnel) Spooner. However, it differs from B. marchan-
tiae by its narrower spores and the presence of hair-like processes in the ectal excipulum.
Its ascospores are never rhomboidal like those of B. marchantiae, B. dicrani, and B. cono-
cephali (Boyd) Spooner. The ascospores in B. dicrani and B. turbinatus (Fuckel) Spooner
are longer, the asci are broader and the apothecial margin is glabrous.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A number of Leotiaceae from Bryophyta occur in the literature. According to their
descriptions, none of these is conspecific with the presently proposed taxon. Hymeno-
scyphus rhytidiadelphi Svrtek from Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus (Hedw.) Warnst. has long
stalked asci measuring 90-110 x 8-10 µm, ascospores 15.5—17 x 5-6 and a denticulate
margin without hair-like processes (Svréek, 1978). Hymenoscyphus atlanticus Candous-
scau from Bryum capillare Hedw. has longer 1-septate ascospores (15-18 x 3.5-4 µm)
and only elongated excipular elements (Candousseau, 1976). Hymenoscyphus erythropus
Dóbb. has much smaller asci and ascospores (Dóbbeler, 1981). The sphagnicolous spe-
cies also differ from B. atromarginatus in several characters. Hymenoscyphus vasaénsis
(P.A. Karst.) Dennis has narrower spores (10-14 x 3 µm) and only elongated elements
in the ectal excipulum (Dennis, 1964), H. sphagnisedus (Velen.) Svréck has translucent

[@Recently, a fungus has been reported from young, planted parks (e.g. Keizer, 1985) which

species in several respects: 1) growth habit; 2) zonation of the pileus; 3) colours; 4) shape

[@The main differences between Coltricia confluens and C. perennis are: 1) The almost
invariable growth-habit in which many carpophores are growing together. Coltricia per-
ennis usually grows solitarily, occasionally with a few confluent pilei, but not as many
as in C. confluens. 2) The weak to almost absent circular zonation of the pileus. If this
zonation is present, the zones are concolorous with the rest of the pileus in C. confluens
whereas in C. perennis the zones are often darker or grey to dark grey. In exsiccata of C.
confluens the pileus is only weakly or not at all radially wrinkled, in exsiccata of C. per-
ennis the pileus usually is radially wrinkled. 3) Coltricia confluens is often brighter and
more uniformly brown (to almost yellowish brown) than C. perennis. The uniform colour is
due to the even felty layer on the pileus. 4) Coltricia perennis has regular circular pilei; in
C. confluens the pilei are mostly irregular: lobed, incised, undulate. 5) The difference in
habitat is striking: C. perennis occurs on dry, sandy soils, usually under Pinus, less fre-
quently under Fagus or Quercus and has been proven to form ectomycorrhiza (Danielson,
1984). It has strongly decreased recently in the Netherlands (Arnolds, 1989). Coltricia
confluens grows in artificial parks and plantations, on fertile soils (humose sand, clay)
under Crataegus, Ulmus, Acer, Quercus, Prunus, etc. and one collection was found in a
grassland without neighbouring trees. Frequently it is attached to chipped wood or other
organic debris. It has been observed in the Netherlands only rather recently (first collec-
tion from 1984), and is probably increasing, especially in urban or otherwise human-
influenced areas. This species seems to be non-mycorrhizal, but saprotrophic instead.#Misc-exposition*]

[@No microscopical differences between C. confluens and C. perennis have been found.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Coltricia confluens may erroncously be identified as C. cinnamomea (Jacq.) Murrill.
The latter species is clearly different from C. confluens (and C. perennis), as is pointed
out by Jahn (1986): 1) The pileus has a radial sheen in C. cinnamomea due to the absence
of a velvety layer of branched, thick-walled hyphae, which makes the radially arranged
hyphae of the surface of the pileus visible. The surface of the pileus of C. confluens (and
C. perennis) is covered by a layer of ascending, branched, thick-walled hyphae. 2) The

[@Singer described two species from the South American area that require a closer look.
His Mycena costaricensis (Singer & Gomez P., 1982: 41) can be readily dismissed on ac-
count of its subglobose spores 4.5—6.3 x 4.5—5.5 µm and its cheilocystidia which arc
stated to be "ad apicem setulis 5-6 µm longis subdigitaliformibus ornatis."#Misc-exposition*]

[@The second species, Mycena multicaudata (Singer, 1973: 44), has several features in
common with M. seclusa, such as a convex pileus with depressed centre, free or almost
free white lamellae, a chlorinaceous odour, a white stipe, and occurrence on wood of
dicotyledonous trees. The differences, however, arc in the pileus of M. multicaudata
which is golden brown, papillate in the central depression and squamulose; in the ‘pilose’
cheilocystidia; in the hyphae of the pileipellis which emit ‘hairs’ of the kind as seen in
Crinipellis; and in the hyphae of the stipe cortex which produce similar ‘hairs’.#Misc-exposition*]

[@A chlorine-like odour is not common in Mycenas, but it is quite possible that, as is the
case in the present species, it is not apparent in freshly picked specimens; it is easily de-
tected upon opening the wax paper in which the specimens have been kept.#Misc-exposition*]

[@This odour together with such characters as basal disc, smooth cheilocystidia, smooth
caulocystidia and strikingly spinulose terminal cells of the hyphae of the pileipellis con-
stitutes a combination not seen in any other species of the genus Mycena. It warrants the
erection of a new section which, with much doubt, may be seen as remotely related with
section Polyadelphia Sing. ex Maas G. (Maas Geesteranus, 1986: 159).#Misc-exposition*]

tion M. citrinovirens M. Lange (Aronsen, 1994b: 54), the first find outside the type local-
ity. In this paper another new species from the same area is proposed. It may be that this
type of coast landscape has scarcely been investigated, but a more plausible explanation is
that there still are many undiscovered species in Mycena.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Mycena agrestis is a species of section Fuliginellae (A.H. Smith ex Sing.) Maas G., of

Fr.) Kummer in Europe. Three species have, like M. agrestis, arcuate lamellae but two of
these — M. austinii (Peck) Kühn. and M. mackinawensis A.H. Smith — can be excluded,
the former because of its white pileus, presence of a basal disc and smaller spores; the lat-
ter because of smaller spores, differently shaped terminal cells of the hyphae of the pilei-
pellis, and occurrence on coniferous branches. This leaves the third species — M. vulgaris
— to be considered and this species can be differentiated from M. agrestis as shown in the
following table.#Misc-exposition*]

[@Corner (1994: 246, fig. 36a) described a Mycena viscidipileus from Borneo which he
thought to be "near to the north temperate Mycena vulgaris ...", but its stipe was said to

[@Mycena lanipes Maas G. & Horak (1995: 173), a species from Papua New Guinea,
was with much doubt placed in section Fuliginellae, since “Both the pileus and stipe ...
feel dry to the touch when fresh” although “their hyphae show gelatinous parts under the
microscope." Also, a "very close look [was needed] to detect the presence of gelatinous
matter among the cheilocystidia."#Misc-exposition*]

[@A species that could be thought to belong to section Fuliginellae is Mycena myxocaulis

[@In the autumn of 1995, which has been exceptionally rainy in the Iberian Peninsula, we
carried out several forays to the autochtonous forests of Juniperus thurifera L., in the prov-

[@Marasmiellus phaeomarasmioides is characterized by its flabelliform pileus densely
covered by excreted crystals, its well developed eccentric stipe and its globose spores.
These characters clearly separate it from the known species of the genus Marasmiellus in
Europe. However, due to its eccentric stipe, it shows some macroscopic similarities with
M. lateralis Bas & Noordel. (Antonín & Noordeloos, 1993), a taxon from the Nether-
lands, which is characterized, however, by its different pileipellis and oblong to subcylin-
drical spores.#Misc-exposition*]

guzmanii Singer and M. parlatorei Singer) seem to be close to M. phaeomarasmioides
and, therefore, have been revised by us. The first one, M. guzmanii Singer, was describ-
ed, and is actually known only from Morelos in Mexico, on branches of several dicotyle-
doncous trees (e.g. Quercus). The latter differs, however, from M. phaeomarasmioides

spores (8-12 x 7-11 µm). Furthermore, Marasmius parlatorei is characterized by scat-
tered cheilocystidia, larger basidia (55-60 x 12.5-16 µm), which are morphologically
similar to those of M. phaeomarasmioides, and the pileipellis with typical Rameales-

[@Several features may make one doubt whether the present species is a true member of
section Rubromarginatae. The collector claimed that the pellicle of the fresh pileus was
fully separable right to the disc, but microscopically there is no trace of the hyphae of the
pileipellis being embedded in gelatinous matter, as one would expect. Unusual for a spe-
cies of the Rubromarginatae is that it is the hyphae running parallel to the lamellar edge
which form the sterile band and from which arise the cheilocystidia. A further unusual
(but not entirely unknown) feature is that the cheilocystidia are filled with some oily matter
which is so faintly coloured as to make it difficult to perceive the lamellar edge of the fresh
fungus being differently coloured from the lamellar sides. The edge turns an unambiguous
reddish brown when the material is dried, however.#Misc-exposition*]

[@We have long been waiting for this new world monograph of Panaeolus sensu lato, which
has become available now. The genus Panaeolus has a wide distribution, including many
taxa that occur in anthropogenous habitats all over the world. To solve the big taxonomic
problems in this genus, a revision on a world-wide scale appeared to be necessary. The
author studied numerous fresh and dried collections, including types. Much attention has
been paid to the variability of characters such as basidiocarp size, expression of veil, hygro-
phaneity, etc. The author reduced about the 160 taxa existing in literature to 32 species
and varieties. The former genera Annellaria and Copelandia are treated as subgenera with-
in Panaeolus, but Panaeolina, with slightly paler, roughened spores, is still maintained as
a separate genus. Good analytical keys, in German as well as in English, are followed by
very extensive descriptions, amply illustrated with drawings of basidiocarps and micro-
scopical characters. Much information is also given on ecology and distribution. Type-
studies gave way to some name changes. An account is given of excluded and dubious

relation to the origin of the isolates. Karyotyping showed a great deal of variability as to
chromosome numbers and size in such an extent, that for every isolate a specific karyo-
