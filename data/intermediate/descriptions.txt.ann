[@Mycelium on the substrate is medium orange-brown,
septate, 3-4 µm diam., often distinctly and coarsely rough;
hyphae often run parallel to the long axis of cells in
substrate tissue but usually branch on the exterior and
appear as a non-patterned network. Sporulation units are
produced as enlarging tips of short branches, at first
concolorous with surface mycelium but soon dark orange-
brown and finally black-brown and opaque. In type material
an occasional enlarging branch can be seen attached to the
hypha from which it developed; in most instances, however,
the enlarged branch elements have broken loose from the
mycelium or are so densely crowded on the substrate and so
nearly opaque that points of attachment cannot be traced.#Description*]
[@Main septa in young branches usually are transverse, later
ones longitudinal or oblique. Spore walls are thick and
externally coarsely rough. Spores are released by fracture
of the basal cell of the hyphal branches that produced
them; the basal cell is somewhat pale in contrast to the
dark color of the enlarged portion of the spore. The
enlarged phaeodictyic elements become subsphaeroidal to
ellipsoidal and commonly occur in chains of 2-3 units with
narrow, pale connective cells. Sizes of the multicellular
elements reach a range of 15-30 x 10-18 µm.#Description*]
[@The distinctive septate units of M. pinguedinis are
50-60 x 10-l4 µm with 6-8 transverse septa and one longi-
septum in some of the widest central segments, pale yellow-
tan, and have slightly rough walls constricted at septa.
No units observed were attached to each other or to genera-
tive hyphae.#Description*]
[@Mycelium of the holotype forms an irregular network
over and within the tissues of the host plant. Very numer-
ous small sclerotial units are scattered throughout the
network, both on the substrate surface and commonly vithin
single cells of the host tissue, where they assume the
general shape and size of the host cells. The sclerotia
consist of thick-walled, dark yellow-brown to brown, essen-
tially isodiametric cells; a high percentage of the sclero-
tia are in a size range of 35-50 x 45-75 µm. Conidiophores
are produced singly, but as many as 2-5 may arise separate-
ly from an individual sclerotium; 8-12 x 25-65 µm, 2-6
septate, medium yellow-brown, with a single well-defined
apical conidiogenous site and pigmented ring.  Conidia are
not seen attached to conidiophores or to each other in
chains; conidia with 2 or more conidiogenous beak sites are
rare. Conidia are short oval, short to long conical or
short to long ovoid; pale yellow-brown to medium yellow-
brown, becoming dark brown in the spore-body with a paler
beak; transverse septa (0-)3-7(-9), longitudinal 1-2 in
each of 1-5 of the transverse compartments; commonly 25-57
x 12-19 µm (max. 75 x 2lum, av. about 42 x 15.5 µm); beakless
or with 1-2 sturdy beak cells that taper gradually to a
blunt apex; beak portion at most 25 µm in length, and in
general not well delimited from body of conidium; outer
walls smooth, rarely inconspicuously rough.#Description*]
[@Alternaria eryngii sporulates prolifically in axenic#Description*]
[@culture, where it presents additional characters that cer-
tainly are not predictable from classical material and
scarcely so from abundant spore populations of the modern
collections seen. Notable among these characters are rapid
production of abundant, moderately long chains of conidia
and, in the conidia themselves, transverse septa of such
dark color that they almost appear to be (but are not)
embellisioid.#Description*]
[@Conidia develop in PCA cultures in unbranched or
branched chains, with a major axis of up to 8-10 units and
occasionally 1-2 lateral branches of 1-4 units. The bran-
ching may originate either in successive conidiogenous
sites of geniculate apical secondary conidiophores or from
short conidiophores produced laterally from conidium body
cells. Conidia are ellipsoid to ovoid, beakless when
terminal or, when intercalary in the chain, with a short,
poorly differentiated terminal area or cell that functions
as a conidiophore; secondary conidiophores sometimes are 2-
4 cells long. Conidia are essentially smooth or rarely
inconspicuously minutely rough, dilute grey-tan with
slightly darker septa; they commonly reach full size at ca.
45-60 x 13-18 µm and have 5-8 transverse septa and 1(-2)
longitudinal or oblique septa in a few of the central#Description*]
[@compartments. Most transverse septa appear somewhat
thickened and darker than the conidium wall, thus appearing
almost embellisioid. However, changing focus serially
through the septa shows that their denser color and appar-
ent thickness are due to the additive effect of pigmented
walls viewed at slightly tilted angles.#Description*]
[@The general appearance of the type is that of rela-.
tively small dictyoconidia that may reach dimensions of
about 50 x 18 µm but that average about 31 x 13 µm in the
very meager sample available. Many of the conidia have a
short conical, narrowly tapered beak, some others are
beakless, and still others have a short apical secondary
conidiophore. Some of the conidia are punctate roughened,
others apparently smooth. Conidia are not strongly con-
stricted at any transverse septum, and no septum is remark-
ably thicker or darker than any other.#Description*]
[@Radial growth rate of typical A. alternata colonies
is about 5mm/d under standard conditions.  Concentric rings
of alternating dense and moderate sporulation are obvious#Description*]
[@on all media (particularly so on PCA and V-8); these
indicate increments of radial growth during successive
exposures to daily light/dark cycles. To the unaided eye
the less dense portions of the colonies (all media) appear
minutely but distinctly granular in transmitted light; each
minute spot is seen, at low magnification (50X), to be a
sporulation clump; each uncrowded sporulation unit near the
colony circumference can be seen to comprise a single,
usually erect conidiophore and a cluster of conidia in
branching chains. The colonies have no height above the
agar surface other than that of the conidiophores and their
spores, i. e., there is no non-sporulating surface or
aerial mass of mycelium, no sterile tufts of hyphae, and no
non-sporulating sectors by the end of 10-12 days under
specified conditions. Colony color and texture are simply
those of the massed sporulation apparatus, almost sooty
black and minutely tufted to densely turfy. No pigment is
released into the media.#Description*]
[@Conidiophores typically arise singly from vegetative
hyphae that are within or flat on the surface of the agar
substrate. On Hay the conidiophore tends to branch or
become successively geniculate near the substrate surface
and to initiate 2-8 chains that develop into a basally
tight, radially loose cluster of about 50-75 conidia. On
PCA, branching of the conidiophore is not a striking
character, although as many as 2-3 such branches (and
therefore 1-3 conidial chains) may occur. Instead, the
more obvious branching is initiated within the chains when
a few secondary conidiophores (intercalary conidial pseudo-
rostra) develop 2-3 conidiogenous loci.  Uncrowded sporula-
tion units on PCA reach a maximum of about 75-125 conidia;
the clusters appear looser and the chains longer than those
on Hay. In older portions of any colony, crowding of erect
conidiophores and their complements of aerial sporulation
present a picture of a solid turf of overlapping, inter-
twined conidial chains.#Description*]
[@Conidia appear olivaceous, a dull grey-green-brown,
when first mounted in lactic acid for microexamination;
they lose the green tone after a few days and exhibit pale
to moderate shades of a yellowish to golden brown. Al-
though the branched sporulation complex supported by a
single conidiophore often consists of more than 100 co-
nidia, single chains traced from initial to youngest
conidium (ignoring branches) have about 15-20 conidia on
PCA and 8-10 on Hay; the density of sporulation on V-8
permits only an estimate that chain lengths are about the
same as those produced on the other media.#Description*]
[@A few conidiophores and their first 1-2 conidia are
produced within 24-48 hours after inoculation of media.
Initial conidia are narrowly ellipsoid when transverse
septa begin to form, progressively about 16 x 6 µm (1 sep-
tum) to about 25-40 x 8-10 µm (3-5 septa), at which stage
the distal cell produces a l-celled secondary conidiophore
approx. 4 x 4 µm. Initial juvenile conidia are subhyaline
and so densely, minutely granulate-roughened that septa can
be demonstrated only through careful focussing. The first
conidium produced and at least the second one of the chain
remain long elliptical as they mature with 4-6 transverse
and usually no (rarely 1-2) longitudinal septa. Young
conidia produced later in the chain are in general rela-
tively wider and shorter ovoid, ellipsoid or subsphaeroid,
maturing for the most part with 3-5 transverse septa (to 6-
7 on V-8) and 1 longitudinal septum (occasionally 2 in a
central transverse segment on Hay). Secondary conidio-
phores on conidia within the chain may be short, l-celled
(as in primary conidia), occasionally 2-3 times as long, or
sometimes reduced simply to a conidiogenous pore in an
otherwise undifferentiated apical cell. Constriction of
the conidium body at the transepta is minor, rarely con-
spicuous. Infrequently one median transeptum of a mature
conidium is slightly thicker and darker than the others; in
general, however, absence of a darker median septum is
characteristic of the group. The original minute, dense
ornamentation of juvenile spores usually becomes conspicu-
ously granular as conidium walls mature and darken; the
walls of some old spores often become variously verrucose.
At the same time the surface of the distal conidial cell
(the secondary conidiophore) remains quite smooth.#Description*]
[@Size ranges of mature conidia (ones that have pro-
duced a secondary conidium) in chain complexes that have
stopped producing new spores are about 10-30 x 5-12 µm
(PCA), 10-24 x 6-13 µm (Hay), and 13-43 x 8-14 µm (V-8),
excluding dimensions of secondary conidiophores. Size
range data of this sort is of extremely limited utility, if
any, in differentiating otherwise morphologically disparate
taxa within the A. alternata group. For example, maximum
length usually does not have positive correlation with
maximum width; and the total range itself may be duplicated
in a different taxon with a different pattern of conidium
enlargement and, therefore, of conidium and chain morphol-
ogy. Focus on patterns of conidium development within
single spore heads and on pattern of chain proliferation is
more useful in defining segregates than is attention to
overall size ranges.#Description*]
[@A few diagnostic characters have proved helpful in
screening typical A. alternata from somewhat similar taxa.
Positive identification of A. alternata rests on the entire
description of the species, but the shape of initial coni-
dia and the nature of the spore wall ornamentation are
constant enough among representatives chosen for the spe-
cies that I am using them, and promoting them, as bench-
marks of the taxon as long as they prove uniquely associ-
ated with the sporulation characters that additionally de-
fine the species. Specifically, the first conidium pro-
duced on a conidiophore of A. alternata usually is narrowly
elliptical, straight or slightly inequilateral, densely and
obscuringly minutely ornamented, and up to about 40 x 10 µm
with 3-5 transepta when it initiates an apical secondary
conidiophore. As for the surface ornamentation of conidia,
it often becomes progressively coarser and more striking as
conidia age. It is not invariably present; but when it is,
it can effectively mask young septa. Thus, at low power
magnification (150X) many conidia of all sizes, including
the largest, appear in surface view to be hazy-brown asep-
tate units; refocusing reveals septation that had been
obscured by overlying ornamentation.#Description*]
[@Typical A. tenuissima, as neotypified by Desmaziéres'
Plantes Crypt. France no. 212 (1827) (Alt. Chronology 1818,
1832), has long-obclavate conidia of medium size that taper
either gradually into an awl-shaped beak or abruptly into a
cylindrical secondary conidiophore. Reconstructed from
drawings of conidia by Wiltshire (1933) and my own observa-
tions, sporulation in nature is in straight chains of a few
conidia. An apical secondary conidiophore occasionally
shows two sporulation sites, thus indicating the uncommon
existence of branching in the sporulation pattern.#Description*]
[@Conidia of the neotype reach a maximum size range of
ca. 60-75(-90) x 12-15(-20)µm. They have as many as 7-10#Description*]
[@complete or partial transverse septa and 1-2(-3) longisepta
through each of most of the transverse compartments; 1-3 of
the complete transepta (the earliest formed) are darker and
more constrictive than the others. Conidia are pale brown
and have apparently smooth to obviously but sparingly
punctate-roughened outer walls.#Description*]
[@Primary conidiophores are ca. 50-60 x 4-5 µm and
geniculate and conidiogenous at 1-5 loci. As an historical
note, the epithet tenuissima originally referred to conid-
iophores of the fungus, "Fibrae tenuissimae," not to the
narrowly tapered conidium beaks that are characteristic of
some conidia in the neotype and that now are considered
diagnostic to some extent for the species-group.#Description*]
[@For classification purposes, the Alternaria tenuis-
sima group is considered to comprise species that, on the
field substrate in nature or under short-term (1-2d) damp
chamber conditions, usually produce unbranched chains of a
few to many long-elliptical conidia that taper gradually
into a narrow but not truly filiform beak. Older conidia
often have a primary, almost median transverse septum that
appears darker and more constricting than are other tran-
septa. Branches a few conidia long may develop as the
chain reaches its maximum length. The length of tapered
beaks varies greatly in young chains, sometimes equalling
or exceeding the length of the spore body but usually being
shorter. Some species continue to produce long, tapered
beaks on essentially all spores as the chains mature with a
possible 10-20 catenate units. Other members of the
species-group tend to produce elongate beaks only on the
first few conidia of a chain (those proximal to the conid-
iophore), after which narrow true beaks are absent, with
short secondary conidiophores taking their place during
chain formation. Conidium wall ornamentation may be
lacking (as viewed at 780X), scattered but conspicuous, or
sometimes evenly, closely punctulate and almost obscurant
of internal septa.#Description*]
[@The initial 2-3 conidia of young chains (less than 24
hrs. on original inoculum) are essentially awl-shaped or at
least have a narrowly tapered upper half; only transverse
septa are present in these spores, which usually do not
exceed 50 x 8 µm. As additional conidia are added distally
to the chain, tapered-beak production is lost; new conidia
terminate abruptly in a short 1-2-celled secondary conidio-
phore. Colonies at 4d are dominated by unbranched chains
of 6-10 conidia. (Longer chains and uncommon branching may
be found in colonies aging past ca. 7d.)#Description*]
[@Fully developed chains of A. tenuissima produced
under standard conditions specified for these studies have
patterns of sporulation and of conidium morphology of
considerable diversity. This diversity, however, retains
some general characteristics with group classification
value, viz., the initial 1-2 and sometimes even 4-5 lowest
conidia of a chain usually have only transverse septa; only
one or two mature conidia in a chain have the helpfully
diagnostic median, subconstricting transverse septa that
are such a striking feature of field conidia; these median-
constricted conidia may be ovoid with a short apical
secondary conidiophore or obclavate and broadly tapered
into an apical conidiophore.#Description*]
[@Mature conidia that have only transepta reach a size
range of ca. 32-45 x ll-13 µm; ovoid muriformly septate
conidia ca. 32-45 x 14-18 µm; obclavate muriformly septate
conidia ca. 40-60 x 16-18 µm. Conidia are medium golden
brown in color and closely, obscurely to conspicuously
punctulate in ornamentation.#Description*]
[@This taxon, represented by an isolate from Citrus sp.

ters of unbranched chains of 10-15 conidia, of which the
largest are of small to moderate size (up to ca. 40-50 µm),
are long-ellipsoid, and have a long tapering beak and a
prominent median septum.#Description*]
[@Elongate conidia of the taxon tend to retain produc-
tion of long slender beaks in culture (typical A. tenuis-
sima does not), and to be narrower, less septate, paler,
longer-chained, and in general more delicate in appearance

view and in slide examinations at 195X and 780X.#Description*]
[@The narrowly tapered beak of typical A. tenuissima,
when present in nature or in young culture, usually origi-
nates as a distinct apical extension of juvenile conidia;
it lengthens as the spore body enlarges. In contrast,
juvenile conidia of this Citrus inhabitant have a conical
or broadly wedge-shaped apical cell that lengthens and
widens into a comparatively sturdy true beak.#Description*]
[@This taxon, represented by an isolate from Passiflora
sp. (Aragaki no. 69; EGS 29-026), may be considered a
borderline member of the species-group. Sporulation rings
produced proximal to the agar substrate in culture consist
of a dense turf of long, unbranched chains of conidia.
Predominant conidia of these chains are narrow-elongate, up
to ca. 35-50 x 10-13 µm, tapered in the upper half but
terminating in a 1-2-celled secondary conidiophore rather
than in a narrowed true beak, and with the median tran-
septum only slightly constricted and pigmented.#Description*]
[@Branching of conidial chains is common within 7-10d,
particularly in sporulation groups borne on aerial hyphae
in rings that alternate with the surface-sporulating rings.
These aerial arborescent clumps of small conidia are
similar in structure to those of typical A. alternata and
thus present a complicating factor in comparison and
identification if spore samples from both aerial and
surface growth are intermixed in a slide preparation.#Description*]
[@A field collection and isolates from mature dry
siliques of Brassica napus L. (rape, canola; Wingate,#Description*]
[@
Indiana, June 1989; EGS 39-096) are instructional in that
they provide not only large numbers of mature conidia in
place on the field substrate but also abundant young chains
(3-4 conidia) on siliques held overnight in a damp chamber
and dense stands of characteristically short (7-9 conidia),
unbranched chains of spores in culture.#Description*]
[@Field specimen conidia of this taxon are very similar
to those of typical field conidia of A. tenuissima.  Spor-
ulation in culture of this Brassica isolate also is similar
to that found in representative isolates of A. tenuissima.
However, conidia of this canola isolate are in general
smaller, both in actual measurements and in general visual
impact of populations in slide preparations. This dif-
ference, notable even without resort to statistical compar-
ison, is attributable to the significant percentage of
relatively large obclavate and broadly tapered conidia (ca.
40-60 x 16-18 µm) present in the A. tenuissima isolate and
the near absence of this particular spore shape and size in
the canola isolate.#Description*]
[@Sporulation on the field specimen is a mixture of
ovoid to long obclavate conidia with short awl-shaped to
long tapering beaks and of similar spores with the beak
apex converted into a secondary conidiophore. A character-
istic slightly constricting median septum usually is
present. Largest conidia have 7-10 transverse septa and 1-
2 longisepta in a few of the transverse segments. Conidium
size reaches a range of ca. 60-90 x 15-18 µm; color is a
medium yellow-tan; ornamentation is lacking or minutely
punctulate.#Description*]
[@Young chains produced on original field material held
overnight in a damp chamber have 3-4 conidia, which may be
narrowly tapered apically or may end abruptly in a l-celled
secondary conidiophore. Largest conidia at this stage are
ca. 25-40 x 8-1llym.#Description*]
[@Chains produced on V-8 agar within an initial 4-5d
are unbranched and have 7-8 conidia. At this stage conidia
usually do not have narrowly tapered beaks; only a small
percentage of spores show enough broad taper that they
might be termed obclavate (in contrast to the common
occurrence of large obclavate conidia in spore populations
of A. tenuissima).  Conidia reach a size range of ca. 30-50
x 10-13 µm; color is dilute yellow-tan; ornamentation is
lacking or obvious but punctulate. Mature septation is 6-8
transverse with 1 longiseptum in a few of the transverse
segments; the median transeptum usually appears slightly#Description*]
[@darker and more constricting than other septa, but not
markedly so.#Description*]
[@As with some other representatives of the A. tenuis-
sima species-group in culture, chain elongation in this
taxon may continue and short branches be formed as colonies
age. However, at 4-5d, chain elongation in this taxon
pauses at ca. 7-8 units throughout most of the population
as radial growth slows down near the limit of the culture
dish.#Description*]
[@A field collection of an overwintered inflorescence
scape of Allium tuberosum Rottler (Chinese chives; Hadley,
Massachusetts, May 1981; EGS 33-200) bears ovoid Alternaria
conidia of medium size with 1-2 constricting transepta and
apical secondary conidiophores. This poor material might
be given tentative place in the A. tenuissima group, but
prediction of the kind of sporulation that might develop
from it would be quite impossible.#Description*]
[@Abundant sporulation on the field specimen under damp
chamber conditions and in subsequent isolates is of a taxon
that produces predominantly long, narrow, apically tapered
conidia in chains (at 4-5d) of ca. 6-10 spores. Only 1-2
spores in any chain exhibit the median constricting septum
character of the A. tenuissima group.  Conidia either are
relatively small (ca. 10-20 µm long), particularly at chain
tips, or fall in a size range of ca. 40-60 x 10-12 µm.
These characteristically long, narrowly elliptical or
obclavate conidia strongly dominate the population; they
have 7-9 transverse septa and either no longisepta or
usually only 1 in a few of the transverse segments. The
median septum usually is not constricting at this stage.
Color is a dilute tan; wall ornamentation is lacking or
minutely to conspicuously punctulate.#Description*]
[@This taxon isolated from Allium sp. borders on a
group of isolates that produce long unbranched chains of
comparatively long, narrow, attenuate-beaked conidia that

sidered to be characteristic of the A. tenuissima species-
group. Alternaria rhadina Simmons (1993; Alt.T&V no. 71)

conidia produced experimentally on Cheiranthus seedlings.#Description*]
[@Conidiophores of A. cheiranthi are produced in dense
stands both in nature and in culture.  Sporulation may be
from a single apical site (usually) or a few successive
sites at geniculations in conidiophores that vary in length
up to 500 µm or more x Sym. Conidia usually are solitary in
field lesions, although short secondary conidiophores on
some conidia indicate that short chains, probably of only
2-3 spores, are formed. Chain formation dominates the
sporulation picture in culture. The pattern is of the
initial conidium on a primary conidiophore giving rise to
1-3 secondary conidiophores from which solitary conidia or
chains of 2-6 develop. The 50X appearance is of irregu-
larly branched sporulation groups of up to 8-12 dark, ovoid
conidia connected by very conspicuous, narrow, often quite
long secondary conidiophores.#Description*]
[@Conidia produced in culture (PCA, V-8) are broadly
ellipsoid or ovoid; enlarge to ca. 50-70 x 20-23 µm, al-
though the bulk of fully developed conidia are near the
lower end of this range; have as many as 8-11 complete or
partial transverse septa, of which 3-5 are darker and
thicker than others, and 0-5 longitudinal septa in the
broadest transverse divisions. Conidia are medium chestnut
brown with the color intensified in edge-view septa.#Description*]
[@Conidium walls are constricted at most of the transepta,
and smooth or very minutely punctulate or eventually
distinctly rough in age.#Description*]
[@Secondary conidiophores arise from otherwise unal-
tered terminal cells as well as from any other cell of the
spore body, with the transition between conidium and new
conidiophore abrupt and well defined. Secondary conidio-
phores may be simple or geniculate and conidiogenous at 2-3
loci; they are medium brown, distinctly septate, and
variable in size to at least 150 x Sym.#Description*]
[@Preuss described a growth of geniculate conidiophores
and associated brown, thick-walled, muriform conidia on
conifer wood. He noted the absence of a polar extension
on the oblong, rounded to angular spores, "ungestielte
Zellenspore" (stipeless or beakless), and devised the
epithet instipitatum to emphasize this difference from what
he considered normal for species of Septosporium. The
correct orientation of the broad-based conidium to conidio-
phore is easy to misconstrue, as Preuss apparently did, for
the basal pore usually is difficult to see within the
contour of the thick, dark conidium wall.#Description*]
[@Conidia of the type specimen (B; EGS 17-053) are good
representatives of the A. cheiranthi species-group. They
are broadly ovoid with either a rounded or a bluntly
tapered apex, medium golden brown, to ca. 33-45 x 18-22 µm,
with as many as 7 complete or partial transepta and 2-3
longitudinal or oblique septa in the largest transverse
compartments. Largest conidia are slightly constricted at
2-3 of the primary septa. No secondary conidiophores are
evident on conidia examined from the field type. External
walls are relatively thick, dark, and minutely ornamented.
Conidiophores are thick-walled, closely septate, simple or
2-3 geniculate, and often up to ca. 100 x 8 µm. Alternaria
instipitata is not known to me in culture or in other
specimens. Wood as a substrate is unusual for an Alter-
naria but not unique to this specimen.#Description*]
[@The type description, based on cultures, speaks of
straight, clavate, ellipsoid, obovoid, or turbinate conidia
borne closely, successively, and singly in a clump of 2-3
at the apex of conidiophores of variable lengths or tardily
in short chains of 2 conidia. Conidia are light to dark
brown to dark olivaceous, 3-8 transversely septate, mostly
1-, infrequently 2-longiseptate in all but basal and apical
segments, 34-51 x 10-22 µm.#Description*]
[@An open aerial network of dark hyphae forms well
above the surface sporulation. These aerial hyphae are
fertile, indeed sometimes, perhaps always, are simply very
long arching surface conidiophores that entangle into an
aerial pseudo-network. Short lateral conidiophores arise
at well-separated intervals on aerial hyphae; each usually
bears a single spore, with 2-3 being exceptional.#Description*]
[@Conidia initially are short ellipsoid or ovoid. As
is true with many dictyosporic hyphomycetes (Alternaria,
Stemphylium, Ulocladium), conidium enlargement follows two
different patterns, with full development either relatively
long and narrow or relatively short and broad. In A.
radicina the population of short-broad, ovoid or obovoid
conidia far outnumbers the percentage of longest, narrower
spores. A noteworthy character of large numbers of ini-
tially ellipsoid conidia is subsequent median or supramedi-
an enlargement that results in an obovoid shape rather than#Description*]

[@Most living isolates and dried culture vouchers that
originated from carrot black rot can be identified with the
representative strain of A. radicina discussed above if the
vagaries of different media, culture conditions, and
stability of isolates are kept in mind. However, the
carrot black rot specimen cited as holotype for A. atroca-
riis has conidia that are strikingly larger than any known

[@The original A. atrocariis substrate of black-rotted
carrot tissue bears abundant growth of dark, thick-walled
hyphae, conidiophores and conidia. Primary conidiophores
are discrete, massive, geniculate at 1 or more successive
sporulation sites, sometimes branched at apex, medium tawny
brown, 20-175 x 10-12 µm. Juvenile conidia are short-
ellipsoid, becoming broad-ovoid at the 3-4-transeptate
stage (ca. 30-45 x 18-25 µm) with conspicuously thick walls
and transepta throughout development. Mature conidia
retain a broadly ovoid or ellipsoid, erostrate shape,
become 5-12 transeptate with 1-3(-4) longitudinal septa in
most of the transverse segments, are ca. 50-60 x 25-38 µm
for a large percentage of conidia with 5-7 transepta, and
ca. 90-100 x 30-37 µm for an equally large percentage that
reach the highest degree of septation. Conidia appear
smooth at all stages of development; color deepens from
initial clear yellowish brown to medium tawny brown with
most transverse and some longitudinal septa a dense brown.#Description*]
[@Most conidia remain solitary, but others produce 1-
few secondary conidiophores from lateral or basal, occa-
sionally apical cells. Primary transverse septa usually
are as thick as the outer wall and are moderately constric-
tive; secondary transverse and most longitudinal septa are
less likely to be as conspicuously thick or as dark as
primary and outer walls.#Description*]

entiation of A. carotiincultae from other taxa of the

and conidia.#Description*]
[@Chain formation involving 2-3(-4) conidia is wide-
spread throughout A. carotiincultae cultures and is easily
detectable at 50X. Secondary conidia typically are gener-
ated from secondary conidiophores so short as to be little
more than sporogenous sites in otherwise undifferentiated
apical cells or, at most, morphologically detectable
structures 1-4(-5) x 2-3 µm. In contrast, production of
secondary conidia in stable isolates of A. radicina is
extremely rare.#Description*]
[@Conidia of A. carotiincultae are either ovoid, 40-60

some segments, or ellipsoid, 65-80 x 15-20 µm, with 8-11

to a medium dull brown, have smooth walls, and are dis-
tinctly constricted at several well-defined, slightly
darker primary transepta.#Description*]
[@Conidia of A. carotiincultae show practically no
tendency to become obovoid, i.e., with mature width greater
above the middle, as is characteristic of a high percentage
of A. radicina conidia. A. petroselini conidia, although
they may to a limited extent reach maximum lengths equal to
those of A. carotiincultae, typically and in more recent
representative cultures are mostly broadly ovoid or ellip-
soid in lengths well below the maximum found in a colony.
In contrast, A. carotiincultae conidium populations have a
high percentage of long ovoid to long obclavate conidia at
or near the maximum length range, along with the accompany-
ing high percentage of mature, shorter ovoid spores.#Description*]
[@Alternaria carotiincultae in culture lacks the
characters of prominent, elongate secondary conidiophores
(as seen in A. cheiranthi and A. japonica), prominent
chains and clumps of hyphal chlamydospores (as found in A.
japonica), and massive primary conidiophore clumps and
related basal cell aggregates (as found in A. smyrnii).#Description*]
[@As indicated above, conidia of the type specimen of
A. petroselini are broadly ovoid to subsphaeroid, reaching
28-47 x 16-35 µm (mature l/w = ca. 1.2-1.4), with 3-4
complete or partial transverse septa, 2-4 longisepta in
broadest segments, and 1 longitudinal or oblique septum in
either or both of the rounded end segments. Conidia appear
smooth and are a medium dull yellow-brown (after years
inlactic acid mount). There is no evidence of secondary
conidium production in the material examined.#Description*]
[@Conidia in young (PCA, 5d) cultures of A. petroselini
exhibit the full range of size and shape found on PCA;
longer growth periods affect only relative quantities of
different shapes. About half the young population develops
along the ovoid-subsphaeroid path to shapes about the same
as those of the type, though somewhat smaller (a size
difference commonly characteristic of heavily sporulating
cultures of Alternaria), 35-38 x 20-24 µm (1/w = ca. 1.5);
the other half develops in a long-ellipsoid pattern to
shapes not found in the type, 50-62(-66) x 20-26 µm (l/w =
ca. 2.53.3).#Description*]
[@Conidia in samples from older cultures (PCA, 10-14d)
are predominantly ovoid-subsphaeroid, with long-ellipsoid
spores present in very small numbers. Upper size ranges
and l/w ratios of the two spore shapes are essentially the
same as those noted for young cultures. Septation of
ovoid-subsphaeroid conidia has the same pattern as that of
the type; long-ellipsoid conidia become 6-9 transeptate
with 1-3 longisepta in about half to all but the basal
segment. A primary conidium with a l-celled apical conid-
iophore is seen very rarely. Most mature conidia appear
quite smooth, sometimes punctulate, and a rather dull
medium brown, with septa darker and well defined but not
thicker than the outer wall.#Description*]

shapes seen in the field type, except that the relatively
large, sturdy, obclavate stage is not found. (Under my
routine conditions, largest conidia in V-8 colonies some-
times taper enough distally to be termed obclavate.)
Although there are large numbers of short-ovoid conidia in
culture populations, the general pattern of development is
into the dominant long-ellipsoid form.#Description*]
[@Short-ovoid conidia reach ca. 32-42(-50) x 22-27 µm,
with 3-5 transepta and 1-3 longisepta in most of the trans-
verse segments. Fully developed long-ellipsoid conidia are
ca. 48-65 x 15-20 µm, with up to 7 transepta and 1-2 longi-
septa in most transverse segments. Conidium color is a
dark but not opaque brown (darker than in A. petroselini),
with somewhat thickened and darker transverse septa, as in
the field type. Walls are smooth or sometimes have minute,
scattered punctulation near the conidium base. Secondary
conidiophores sometimes are produced but are uncommon.#Description*]
[@Field conidia are broadly ellipsoid or ovoid to
obclavate, with a bluntly rounded apical cell that may
develop through an abrupt transition into a broad, short l-
2-celled secondary conidiophore. Largest field conidia
reach a range of ca. 80-100 x 20-30 µm, initially are smooth
but may become evenly pitted or punctate-rough at maturity,
are a medium translucent tawny brown in color, and have 7-
10 transverse septa and 1-3 longisepta in several of the
transverse segments.#Description*]

[@alternata. Primary conidiophores arise directly from the
agar surface or, to a great extent, from fertile aerial
hyphae that form a loose, almost cobwebby network similar
to that observed in cultures of other taxa of the A.
cheiranthi species-group. As with field sporulation,
conidia in cultures may remain solitary or to a major
degree form chains of 2-4 spores. Secondary conidiophores
in such chains of non-beaked conidia may be simply a per-
foration in an otherwise unchanged apical cell, or they may
be well-differentiated outgrowths up to ca. 55-60 x 5-6 µm.#Description*]
[@Conidia produced in culture are basically short to
long ovoid, beakless, and with a good degree of lateral
symmetry when young. Maturing conidia almost always are
strongly constricted at most of their transverse septa and
typically retain lateral symmetry or, in some isolates,
have several cells that are variously swollen. Conidia are
smooth and medium tawny or cinnamon brown in color when
young and may remain so or only slightly darker throughout
development to maximum size. In some isolates apical and
basal cells of conidia remain the original medium orange-
brown while all other cells become much darker brown, fre-
quently nearly opaque, and at times evenly pitted or rough.#Description*]
[@A constant feature of all known isolates of A.
japonica is production of distinctive chains or knots of
dark, thick-walled, often strongly ornamented cells in
surface and subsurface hyphae. Such chlamydospores may be
sparse and radial in developing hyphae or, in some iso-
lates, so dense that the substrate appears almost opaque.#Description*]
[@A high percentage of the spore population matures in
culture as broadly ovoid conidia with only 2-3 transverse
septa plus 1-2 longisepta in 1-3 of the transverse seg-
ments; size range is ca. 35-45 x 20-24 µm. Another high
percentage of spores matures with 5-7 transverse septa and
1-2 longisepta in a few to most of the transverse segments;
size range (spore body only) is ca. 55-70 x 18-22 µm.#Description*]
[@Extensive black field colonies of A. smyrnii are (at
50X) composed of open to dense thickets of erect, rigid,
shiny black, setose conidiophores. At higher magnifi-
cations, these conidiophores are seen to be very dark
brown, thick-walled, and closely septate, arising singly or
more often in clumps from enlarged, rough, cellular bases
or from multicellular sclerotia. They range from 200-300 µm#Description*]
[@to well over 500 µm long x ca. 11-25 µm wide; they often are
conidiogenous at well-separated geniculate sites or from
several short, closely consecutive apical cells.#Description*]
[@Conidia in the field type are ovoid, with 7-8
slightly constricting, well-defined but not thickened
transepta and 1-3 longisepta in a few to most of the
transverse segments, up to ca. 64-96 x 24-27 µm, pale to
medium yellowish brown, and smooth. Occasional short, 1-
celled apical secondary conidiophores are evidence that
chains, probably very short, are produced.#Description*]
[@The appearance of A. smyrnii cultures (PCA 5-10d) is
similar to that of other members of the A. cheiranthi
species-group. Short to long erect conidiophores originate
at or beneath the agar surface, sometimes as distinguish-
able individuals in a close turf of sporulating structures
and often as clumps arising from conspicuous knots or
sclerotial growths of very dark cells formed within or on
the agar substrate. Free-standing conidiophores are ca.
100-600 (or often much more) x 3-7 µm, dilute yellow-tan,
with conidiogenous branches at various levels. The longest
conidiophores arch and entangle, forming a loose pseudo-
network above the colony.  Conidiophores that originate in
sclerotial knots do not develop through to spore production
within ca. 2 weeks of active culture, but eventually do so.#Description*]
[@Conidia produced in culture are ovoid (as in field
specimens), sometimes obovoid, or to a high percentage
narrowly ovoid or ellipsoid, with 7-8 transverse septa in
largest ovoid spores, up to 10 transepta in narrowly ellip-
soid spores, and 1-2 longisepta in a few of the transverse
segments. Ovoid and obovoid conidia reach a size range of
ca. 40-58 x 18-22 µm and the narrower ellipsoid ones, which
dominate the population, ca. 67-96 x 13-16 µm. Conidia are
smooth, occasionally punctulate, and medium brown in color.
Chains of 2 conidia occur commonly, with the generating
secondary conidiophore usually a single short cell or
sometimes nothing more than a slight apical, aseptate
swelling with an apical conidiogenous site.#Description*]
[@Stable isolates produce intensely  brown-black,
spreading colonies on PCA and V-8 agars (colonies on Hay
restricted, ca. 5mm diam. in 2-3 wks). Sporulation in
stable isolates is almost entirely from abundant, closely
adjacent primary conidiophores that arise directly from the
agar surface. Conidiophores are simple, with a single
apical conidiogenous site, or variously branched and
geniculate with conidiogenous sites at the tip of each
branch or bend; color dilute tan, size ca. 15-65 x 5-6 µm.#Description*]
[@Conidia are borne in long chains, usually with the
initial few spores strikingly larger than subsequent
secondary spores, which tend to be progressively smaller as
the chain lengthens. Young unbranched chains may have 10-
20 spore units. Usually, however, multiple branching of
primary conidiophores and chains is a dominant character,
resulting in loose tufts of 50-60 or more conidia.#Description*]
[@Conidia in individual sporulation tufts (on PCA) are
narrowly ovoid or ellipsoid in the larger initial units,
then progressively broader ovoid, then smaller ovoid in
terminal regions of the chain. Initial conidia have a size
range of ca. 50-60 x 12-l7 µm and 6-7 transepta with 0-1
longiseptum in a few segments; intermediate ovoid spores
ca. 30-40 x 15-18 µm and 4-5 transepta with 0-2 longisepta
in a few segments; smaller ovoid spores ca. 10-25 x 6-10 µm
and 1-3 transepta with no longisepta.#Description*]
[@No individual conidium has a true beak. The terminal
conidium in any chain has a rounded apex. All other
conidia, in both nature and culture, have an apical conid-
iogenous structure which usually is a l-cell secondary
conidiophore ca. 5 x 5 µm, but which also frequently is a
smaller, similar outgrowth lacking a septum to separate it
from the spore body. (Secondary conidiophore measurements
are not included in conidium dimensions given above.)#Description*]
[@The spore body of conidia of all sizes (except of the
youngest) is a medium yellowish to reddish brown in face
view; the apical secondary conidiophore is a dilution of
the same color. The spore wall, in edge rather than face
view, and septa are of a similar but darker brown.  Septa
appear somewhat thickened in edge view, but are not typi-#Description*]

smooth, but sometimes has punctulate or, in age, even more
pronounced ornamentation.#Description*]

into medium to dark brown hues, which are particularly
evident in walls and septa in edge view.  Conidia of at
least one isolate consistently remain yellowish-tan but
otherwise have typical morphology (EGS 36-158; recd 1983 as

ulate, initiating branches in the conidial chain.  Second-
ary conidiophores also occasionally develop laterally from
any cell of a conidium, with subsequent chain branching,
but usually not more than one such lateral conidiophore is
produced per conidium.#Description*]
[@Conidium color is similar to that of A. brassicicola
but less intense, viz., medium yellowish tan with darker
septa in edge view; outer walls are usually smooth, but
sometimes are detectably rough (pusticulate) and occasion-

[@Alternaria brassicae is a striking, very frequent
component of the fungus flora of many unprotected brassi-
caceous crops, particularly of common head cabbage grown

[@In nature, juvenile conidia ca. 60-85 x 13-15 µm have
3-6 transverse septa and at this stage already are develop-
ing from a narrowly ovoid, almost ellipsoid form into a
narrowly obclavate one as the conidium apex begins pro-
duction of a discernible true beak. The sturdy beak, never
fragile or filamentous, increases in length as the spore
body continues to enlarge and produce additional septa.#Description*]
[@Conidia usually are solitary at the conidiogenous
apex of simple or geniculate conidiophores; secondary
conidium production occurs in nature but is not a dominant
character on the natural substrate. Fresh mature conidia
are dilute straw-colored to pale greenish tan; the surface
of fresh, mature but not overdeveloped conidia appears to
be quite smooth.#Description*]
[@The natural conidium population contains spores in
all degrees of long obclavate form, with a high proportion
of mature conidia in the range of 250-300 x 35-40 µm,
commonly with ca. 12 constricting transverse septa and
usually only one longiseptum in a few transverse segments
(or 2 in a few transverse segments of the broadest co-
nidia). The sturdy beak, usually without transverse septa,
commonly makes up about one-fourth to one-third of the
mature spore length.#Description*]
[@The major differences between sporulation usually
found in nature and that developed in culture are that (in
culture) chain formation of 2-3 conidia becomes a dominant
character, strikingly long secondary conidiophores are
produced by a large proportion of conidia, and conidium
color deepens to a medium olivaceous brown. Greatest
conidium body length is about the same in both nature and
culture (ca. 150-200 µm); the sturdy beak typical of field
material is retained in culture, or is replaced by a short
l-celled secondary conidiophore, or is converted into a
sturdy, simple or geniculate secondary conidiophore ca. 5-
8 µm wide and as short as 10 µm or as long as or longer than
the spore body.#Description*]
[@Conidia illustrated with the type description (Toga-
shi 1926) are markedly distoseptate, with up to 12 angular
to rounded lumina separated only rarely by 1-2 transverse
eusepta. Each conidium has a rather stiff narrow beak ca.
0.5-1.0X the length of the conidium body.#Description*]
[@Numerous field specimens examined (Simmons 1989) have
similar conidia with series of well-defined, strongly
angular lumina with narrow connectives and rarely with 1-2
transverse eusepta. Conidia of the type and other sporu-
lating field specimens characteristically are long and
narrow, up to ca. 150-170 x 8-13 µm.#Description*]
[@More recent isolates (Thailand, EGS 40-146) produce
conidia that have a short-broad appearance disconcertingly
different from the usual field spores. Their cell lumina
are broadly octagonal, abutting the conidium outer wall and
each other rather than appearing as linear series of
strongly incised cell units surrounded by a distoseptum
matrix. Only the first flush of conidia on Gomphrena
lesions held overnight in a damp chamber exhibit strongly
angular lumina. This striking character rarely is seen in
conidia from 4-6d PCA cultures.#Description*]
[@Conidia produced in PCA culture are borne singly on
simple erect conidiophores. Juvenile conidia are ovoid to
obclavate to broadly elliptical; interior compartmentaliza-
tion but not euseptation is visible when conidia are no
more than 20 µm long. Development of a narrow, rather stiff
apical beak often begins when a conidium is about 50 µm
long. The spore body of fully developed conidia is ca. 80-
100 x 18-20 µm, the beak ca. 60-80 x 2 µm. The 7-10 compart-
ments in conidia produced in culture appear broadly octago-
nal, reaching the full width of the spore body. Transverse
eusepta may be formed, usually across one or two of the
basal distosepta, then through one or two others. Longitu-
dinal eusepta have not been seen but rarely there is a
vertical or oblique partition, which actually is the
interface of two cells formed by division of one of the#Description*]

sometimes is minutely ornamented, but that of fully devel-
oped spores appears smooth, dilute gold-tan, and almost
imperceptibly constricted only where eusepta have formed.#Description*]
[@An isolate from leafspot of Alternanthera denticula-
ta, Queensland, Australia, arrived in March 1990 from J. L.
Alcorn with the suggestion "Nimbya?" (Alcorn 8933, EGS 39-
118). Long, narrow, distoseptate, tardily euseptate
conidia with extremely long narrow beaks defined the
isolate as a Nimbya and suggested a possible resemblance to
Alternaria alternantherae on Alternanthera philoxeroides in
Louisiana, U.S.A. The original Louisiana material had been
used up in isolation work, so derivative cultures proved to
be the major link to the type.#Description*]
[@Conidia and their apical beaks, as originally illus-
trated (Holcomb and Antonopoulos 1976), exhibited so many
and various swollen cells that experience suggested inter-
nal parasitism as an explanation. Culture and 1-conidium
reisolation of the ATCC lyophil preparation demonstrated
that the ex-type isolate is culturally unstable (some
sectors of non-sporulating aerial mycelium) but that, after
reisolation, it can produce enormous numbers of conidia
from solid stands of surface conidiophores within 2-4d on
PCA and V-8 agars. The isolate from Australia performs in
essentially the same manner.#Description*]
[@The ex-type reisolates in recent cultures reveal that
the taxon is a typical Nimbya and that conidium and beak
structure and development are considerably more uniform
than initial type illustrations indicate. Certainly the
kinds of swollen, euseptate conidium cells originally
photographed can be found. But they tend to gain promi-
nence in aging cultures (Holcomb and Antonopoulos mention
6-wk-old conidia) rather than in vigorously sporulating
colonies a few days old.#Description*]

begin before lumina form or only after the conidium body

stages of development in culture (field conidia not seen).
Lumina of both conidia and conidiophores are distinctly
angular and well separated in the Australian field mate-
rial, but they also become octagonal, rounded, and crowded
in conidia produced in culture.#Description*]
[@Largest conidia contain 6-10 cells, in 1-2 of which a
longitudinal division (not euseptum) may occur. True
transverse septa, distinct from lumen interfaces, are rare
in conidia produced in developing ex-type colonies (4-7d
PCA); 2-3 eusepta can be found in conidia from colonies
about 2 wks old. Conidium bodies become as large as 80-115
x  18-20 µm and characteristically generate unbranched
septate beaks 350-470 x 2-4 µm.  Conidium walls are essen-
tially smooth; only rarely does a conidium have minor areas
of punctulate roughness.#Description*]
[@A peculiarity of conidium beaks in N. alternantherae
is a conspicuous enlargement of the apex, ca. 4 µm in a beak
2 µm diam. Such swellings do not necessarily remain termi-
nal, for intermittent renewal of beak growth often results
in 5-6 successive regions of narrow beak interrupted by a
series of apical swellings, each delimited by a septum in
the long beak. Rare chains of two conidia can be seen at
50X within the population of predominantly solitary spores.#Description*]

Celosia cristata. Conidia produced under natural condi-
tions are long ovoid, ca. 60-100 x 10-18 µm plus a rather
stiff beak up to 140 x 2-3 µm. The conidium body exhibits
8-10 broadly octagonal to rounded lumina crowded in a
linear series. Usually 2-3 tranverse eusepta are present.
A longitudinal division of a single lumen is found in some
conidia. Conidium walls are dilute yellow-tan and smooth.#Description*]
[@Field lesions held in a damp chamber readily produced
abundant distoseptate, long-beaked conidia within 48 hrs.#Description*]
[@Juvenile conidia (PCA cultures) are long obclavate,
almost naviculate, 50-60 x 7-9 µm, until initiation of long,
narrow beaks. Lumina form rapidly within the distoseptum
matrix as the conidium enlarges. Conidia sampled at 7d on
PCA are predominantly narrowly ellipsoid with spore body
100-190 x 12-17 µm plus beak up to 250-470 x 2-4 µm. Largest
conidia have 12-15 broadly octagonal to rounded lumina in a
longitudinal series. Eusepta are visible through 1-3
distosepta; longitudinal division of 1-3 lumina may occur.
The basal cell of a high percentage of conidia is strik-
ingly long and narrow (ca. 14-18 x 5-8 µm) in a population
of conidia that usually mature with broadly rounded basal
cells. The conidium wall usually is smooth but sometimes
is minutely but distinctly punctulate; color is medium
golden-tan. The beak apex of large conidia often termi-
nates in a swelling ca. 3-4 µm diam. There is evidence of
terminal swelling and successive renewed beak growth and
terminal swelling in longest beaks, much as is found in N.
alternantherae. Chains of two conidia are produced very
rarely.#Description*]
[@Conidia found on a leafspot of the lectotype are much
as Davis described them: "ferruginous, lanceolate, 6-8
septate, tapering into a flagelliform distal portion about
as long as the body, 100-165 x 13-74" [presumably 13-17 µm].#Description*]
[@Additional observations are as follows. Young long-
ovoid, beakless conidia ca. 45 x 8 µm already are 2-disto-
septate, i.e., with 3 cell lumina. Beak formation begins
on slightly larger conidia. The conidium bodies of fully
developed conidia are ca. 65-90 x 15-20 µm, with beaks ca.
40-60 x 2 µm, giving a total length of ca. 150 µm or more
(beaks of largest conidia sometimes have broken off).
There are as many as 7-9 transverse distosepta, with
eusepta through 1-4 of these. Vertical partition of a cell
lumen is rare but has been seen in as many as 2 transverse
segments of a single conidium. Cells in conidia of medium
size are strongly angular and well separated except for a
narrow channel between adjacent ones; they become octagonal
to fully rounded and crowded as the spore body enlarges.
Conidia are a dilute gold-tan in color, with eusepta
appearing slightly darker in edge view.#Description*]
[@The figure accompanying the type description of A.
pimpriana illustrates long narrow conidium bodies with
equally long or longer stiff narrow beaks; inclusive
Measurements given are 205.8-260.5 x 12.5-17 µm. The
internal septation, given as 5-13 transverse and 1-2
longitudinal, is drawn as being distoseptate, i.e., with a
chain of lumina embedded in the distoseptum matrix of the
spore body; no transverse eusepta are shown. The appear-
ance, as illustrated by Rao, is of a typical Nimbya.#Description*]
[@The two conidia illustrated in Fig. 117 are the only
ones I have seen in the lectotype. They differ from those
in the Rao illustration in having distinctly angular lumina
(Rao drew them as being rounded), transverse eusepta
through 1-3 of the 7-9 distosepta, and nothing suggesting a
longitudinal septum. The scanty evidence of the N. pimpri-
ana lectotype conidia does not permit significant compari-
son with other species of Nimbya already described.#Description*]
[@The type specimens of both Thyrostromella myriana
(Desm.) Hóhnel (1919), the type of the genus, and T.
heterospora were described from collections on "Calama-
grostis arenaria" [Ammophila arenaria (L.) Link]. The type
specimen of T. myriana occurred as tiny black dots on dry
leaves and culms in the summer, whereas T. heterospora
occurred under moist conditions in the autumn as effuse
velvety growths on dead leaves found after they had been
torn or cut off and discarded on the ground. (See Alt.
Chronology 1852 for lectotypification.)#Description*]
[@Initial reaction to the presence of these congeneric
taxa on the same substrate species might be to suspect that
they are simply different age and developmental stages of
one species. However, the patterns of conidium development
in the two taxa are different, and the size and septation
of largest conidia of the two are markedly different.#Description*]
[@Conidia of T. myriana (Fig. 118) become phaeodictyic,
with three transverse and 1-2 longitudinal or oblique
septa, and at largest size about 32 x 19 µm. Desmaziéres#Description*]
[@(1852) gave the size as 30 x l5 µm; Hughes (1955), working
from part of the type collection, gave 21-32 x 13-19.5 µm.#Description*]
[@Conidia of T. heterospora become complexly cellular,
with as many as 6-7 major and several minor transepta and
numerous series of oblique and longitudinal septa. The
conidia commonly are as large as 50 x 33 µm and exhibit all
the several shapes noted by Desmaziéres: rounded, ovoid,#Description*]
[@oblong, or pyriform. Some have a bluntly obconic apex, and
at least one conidium has been seen to produce a secondary
apical conidiophore.#Description*]
[@Although T. heterospora was described initially as a
Macrosporium and was considered by Desmaziéres to be
similar to M. cheiranthi (= Alternaria cheiranthi), conidium
production in Thyrostromella is distinctly blastic and
conidium secession rhexolytic and, thus, is fundamentally
different from the sort of apparently tretic or porogenic
conidiogenesis found in Alternaria. I have not seen fresh
material or a living isolate of any Thyrostromella species.#Description*]
[@The carrot pathogen now known correctly as Alternaria
dauci was the first taxon of the genus to be described and
differentiated largely on the basis of conidia with long,
narrowly tapered to filiform beaks. Kühn (1855) used the
filamentous beak character to distinguish A. dauci from
another large-spored species known to him which, however,
has conidia gradually tapering into a broad, blunt-tipped
apical region, Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (syn.
Sporidesmium exitiosum Kühn [1855]).#Description*]
[@Alternaria dauci grows well and sporulates abundantly
on PCA and V-8 agars; growth and sporulation on Hay agar
are thin and sparse. Conidiophores produced on PCA are
erect, 30-100 x ca. Sym, medium olivaceous brown, and
either simple, with a single terminal conidiogenous site,
or 1-2 geniculate and conidiogenous.#Description*]
[@Conidia are predominantly solitary, but a primary
conidium occasionally (uncommonly) produces a sturdy
terminal secondary conidiophore and subsequent secondary
spore with the usual filamentous beak. Juvenile ovoid
conidia as short as 20 µm initiate a primary transverse
septum and an apical, narrow beak at about the same time.
By the time a young conidium is about 30 µm long, 2-3
transepta and a filamentous beak ca. 50 µm long may have
been produced; concurrently, the conidium body becomes#Description*]
[@evenly minutely punctulate.#Description*]
[@Conidium enlargement and beak extension remain
concurrent until a high percentage of conidia become ca.
80-100 x 15-24 µm (spore body) with a major filamentous beak
as long as 200-250 µm x Sym tapering distally to ca. 2 µm;
the major beak often has a single lateral branch, commonly
up to ca. 100 µm but sometimes twice as long.#Description*]
[@Conidium bodies at greatest development are long
ellipsoid to obclavate, with 8-11 transverse septa and
usually only 1, rarely 2-3 longitudinal septa in fewer than
half of the transverse segments. Young-mature conidia are
a dilute yellowish tan, which becomes medium to dark oliva-
ceous brown at full development. Some conidia produced in
colonies on PCA may appear smooth, but most of them are
minutely, evenly punctulate or occasionally even more
distinctly ornamented. Conidia produced on V-8 agar have
relatively inconspicuous ornamentation or are smooth, as
are those produced on host leaves in nature.#Description*]
[@Most conidia of A. ulmi are bluntly tapered and
rarely have a terminal pore, thus are solitary or rarely
short-chained in the type specimen. Young conidia are
sublanceolate (apex blunt rather than pointed), and have 7-
8 transverse septa when a single longiseptum is produced in
one of the median segments. Largest conidia remain nar-
rowly to broadly lanceolate or obclavate as they mature,
and are 70-95 x 17-22 µm, with 9-13 complete or partial
transepta and 1-3 longitudinal or oblique septa in most of
the transverse segments. Conidia are yellowish tan and#Description*]

septate, yellow, 96-112 x 24 µm, so there is no doubt that I
have examined the same taxon he described in segregation
from the original growth mixture.#Description*]
[@Most conidia of the type collection are long, nar-
rowly ellipsoid to somewhat obclavoid, with a moderately
long, narrowly tapered (but not filiform) true beak. A few

produce a functional secondary conidiophore extension of
the narrow beak. Fully developed conidia reach ca. 80-120

longitudinal or oblique septa in many of the transverse
segments. Conidia are pale yellowish tan, slightly con-
stricted at major septa, and essentially smooth.#Description*]
[@Fuckel described conidia without a stipe, "sine
stipite," as 82 x l6 µm in size. Since the concept of a
spore "stipe" for Alternaria at that time could refer
either to a conidiophore or to a narrow beak (with reversed
orientation), his measurement of 56 µm for a stipe would
bring total conidium length of ca. 138 µm into better accord
with my own observations on a very limited sampling of
conidia with long-tapered true beaks.#Description*]

[@When grown under growth chamber or greenhouse conditions in an
extremely warm, humid environment the transition from light colored, effuse,
conidiomata-bearing primary stromata into the darker, denser, perithecium-
bearing ascostromata frequently fails to occur. Profuse conidiation continues
until leaf senescence, when primary stromata dry up, fragment, and
disintegrate. This anamorph cycle may continue for up to three months with no
teleomorph development. Under such conditions, if and when the teleomorph
occurs, dark perithecial initials develop directly from the effuse primary
stroma, speckling its white surface. Only then does the ascostroma become
black and pseudoparenchymatous. Transition from the anamorph state to the
teleomorph tends to occur on numerous leaves, or even plants, simultaneously.
In nature, our observations suggest that the primary Ephelis state is relatively
short-lived, the Balansia ascostroma forming soon after leaf expansion.#Description*]

[@Deighton (1967) re-defined Passalora Fr. and distin-
guished Cercosporidium Earle by well-developed stromata.
Within the Cercospora complex, the characteristics of stro-
mata are useful specific features, but unsuitable to discri-
minate genera. Furthermore, stromata are not absent in Pas-
salora bacilligera Fr. & Mont. (= type species of this ge-
nus). They are small but conspicuous, agreeing with the size
of the substomatal cavities of the attacked leaves (cf. Arx,
1983). Therefore, Arx (1983) treated Cercosporidium as syno-
nymous with Passalora and this has been followed by Cas-
tafieda and Braun (1989), Deighton (1990) and Braun (1992).
The conidial scars (Passalora type) are almost unthickened
to slightly thickened and slightly to obviously darkened
(Deighton, 1990; Braun, 1992). True Cercospora s.str. scars
are conspicuously thickened and darkened. The size of the
scars is variable and depends on the width of the conidial
hila. Cercospora scars are mostly broad, dark and very con-
spicuous, but fairly minute in some species with very narrow
conidia. The differences between slightly thickened Pas-
salora scars and conspicuously thickened Cercospora scars
are, of course, only gradual. But the different types of
conidial scars combined with characteristical conidia
(shape, size, colour) warrant the clear separation of Cer-
cospora and Passalora.#Description*]

[@This species has been adequately described and illustrated (2). The collection
that included the teleomorph differed from this description only in having larger
conidiomata, up to 380 µm vs 140-280 µm diam, and larger conidia, up to 55 x
17.6 µm vs 30-43 x 10-12 µm. Much of the difference in conidial size might be
accounted for by measurement of live vs long-dead conidia.
Stromata destined to form La as well as idia have a ll idial
locule than those forming only conidia. After conidium formation, the
remainder of such an ascogenous stroma consists of bulbous cells which form
one or more archicarps toward the base, near the dark stromatal wall.
Spermatia adhere to a narrow trichogyne which extends from each archicarp
beyond the top of the stroma. The asci are basal and crowded in the locule.

purplish reaction may be observed. NH,OH (vapor) colors the cuticle bright ink-red.
Under UV on pileus a bright red (cinnabar red), on stipe and context violet
fluorescence. The context, when exposed to the air for some time gives a yellow
fluorescence (this can also be observed on the underside of the bulb). This reaction
can also be seen in exsiccata. Under the fluorescence microscope cross-shaped crystals
can be seen within the hyphae of the veil and the epicutis which fluoresces red like

[@Thallus morphology. - The thallus of Pseudogyalecta verrucosa is provided with large,
hemispherical verrucae which are 0.15-0.2 mm in diameter and filled with colourless crys-
tals, probably calcium oxalate (Fig. 1A-C). Between the verrucae the thallus is smooth to
very minutely farinose. The thallus colour varies from whitish or pale greyish to light bluish
or greenish grey, the verrucae being purely white or at least paler than the remainder of the
thallus#Description*]
[@Apothecial morphology and external development. - The apothecia are regularly roun-
ded, but may become somewhat irregular in outline when old. The apothecial disc i is usually
plane (Fig. 1A-C). Apothecial geny is gy pous, and early pri | stages are
visible as hemispherical papillae (Fig 1A) The apothecial margin is not very distinct and
disappears in old apothecia (Fig. 1B-C). The diameter of mature apothecia varies between
0.3 and 1.0 mm. The apothecial disc is pale flesh-coloured to orange and somewhat trans-
lucent, with the margin being concolorous with the disc or slightly paler.#Description*]
[@Apothecial anatomy. - The lateral part of the exciple is paraplectenchymatous, its cells
having relatively thick, gelatinous walls, whereas the internal part is composed of radiate,
branched hyphae embedded in a gelatinous mass (Fig. 2A). There is no encrustation with
crystals in any part of the exciple. However, the outermost margin of the exciple sometimes
disintegrates into short threads with globose cells (cf. LOCKING et al. 1995). An epithecium
is not distinct. The hypothecium is colourless to pale yellowish.#Description*]
[@The paraphyses are usually simple, septate, 1 5-2 µm thick and slightly thickened api-
cally (Fig. 2B). The ascus is of the lecanoralean type, with a well developed tholus. When
stained in Lugol's solution, the ascus tip exhibits a more or less tubular structure becoming
broader towards the apex. The upper- and outermost part of the tholus is darker than the
central and basal parts (Fig. 2B). This structure matches the Badimia-type (LOCKING et al
1995), which is most similar to the Byssoloma-type sensu HAFELLNER (1984)#Description*]
[@The ascospores are 20-32 x 5.5-7 µm in size, ellipsoid to fusiform and colourless. Most
ascospores are 7-septate, but part of the ascospores becomes submuriform when mature,
with 1(-2) longitudinal septa. Very rarely ascospores with only (4-)5(-6) or with (8-)9(-10)

[@Average radial growth rate of colonies on PDA at 20'C in
darkness approximately 7.5 mm per day; colonies initially are white,
velvety, with a characteristic fine swirling growth pattern during the first
few days of growth after inoculation. Colonies become buff and cottony
or floccose with mycelium raised in two or three concentric irregular
circles about the colony centre and turn grey under exposure to
fluorescent lights; reverse yellow brownish, yellow brown or dark amber-
coloured, sometimes with brown to black blotches. After 7-10 day's
exposure of the culture under lights, fruit bodies started to form on agar
separately or in groups of 3-5. All cultures produced abundant
conidiomata under the above conditions. However, only two, ORB67
and ORB86, produced both o-conidia and B-conidia.#Description*]

[@This is a very common mushroom in the northeastern part of the United States. It
has an orangish tan to orangish brown pileus with a striate margin. There is rarely
any remnant of the universal veil left on the pileus. The stipe is white to pallid and
exannulate and has a membranous, whitish, rusty-stained volval sac at its base. The
rusty stains on the volval sac, the color of the pileus, and the spore size and shape are
considered to be diagnostic. A complete comparison of anatomy between the North
American material and European material has 1 not yet been made. However, Tulloss
(unpub. data) has found they differ in the anatomy of the lamella trama and in the size
of the spores. This species is found in many forest types; the WV collections
reviewed occurred in mixed forests containing pines, hemlock, and striped maple
(Acer pensylvanicum L.) and in forests dominated by yellow birch, hemlock, red oak,

the pileus is . . . burnt sienna color with yellowish margin. It varies also in size.”
During his time in West Virginia, Beardslee’s notes (MICH) indicate that he distin-

with a knife blade or a fingernail. The stipe is usually exannulate although one may
find 2 membranous annulus early in the expansion of A. peckiana, and other species
(for example, A. volvata) will exhibit a flocculent annular zone when freshly
expanded. Unlike other sections of the genus, most members of this section that have
been spot tested for laccase have exhibited a positive reaction in at least some part, if
not all, of the fruiting body (Tulloss, unpub. data). A monograph on the Canadian,
Mexican, and U.S. taxa of this section is under preparation by Tulloss.#Description*]
[@This species differs from others of section Amidella found in the region of study
by having a true membranous annulus at the point at which the pileus begins to
expand out of the volval sac. The annulus, however, is rapidly lost. The elongate to
cylindric spores are also an important character. The strongest distinguishing charac-
ter is mi The subhy of A. kii iful hyphae run-
ning parallel to the hymenial surface and located just below the bases of the basidia.
Kauffman said the fruiting bodies sometimes have the odor of radishes. The two
fruiting bodies collected in the region to date were collected in very rainy periods.
Tulloss (unpub. data) has observed that in wet conditions the spores of A. peckiana
are shorter and broader than would be expected on average.#Description*]
[@This medium-sized mushroom has a subglobose, very thick-walled volval sac that

cose region near the apex when young. The inner layer of the universal veil is some-
times left so completely on the pileus that the unexpanded pileus has the appearance
of a filbert nut with a fibrous, brown coating. All parts of the mushroom, but particu-
larly the inner layer of the universal veil and the flocculence on the stipe, will oxidize
brick-red or red-brown rather rapidly. The subhymenium of this species is cellular

brownish tints as it ages. The inner layer of the universal veil is left in what appear
to be cuneiform characters around the slightly striate pileus margin. The stipe is
exannulate and often more than 10x longer than wide. In larger specimens, the stipe
is often somewhat sinuate. The universal veil is saccate, tough, and often completely
buried in the soil. The subhymenial tree of this species consists of branching rows of
small cells that seem to turn a right angle at the central stratum of the trama and make

in radial streaks. The stipe has a superior annulus and a subabrupt bulb that is
markedly cleft in several places around its perimeter. These longitudinal clefts give
the impression of a cloven hoof. The entire fruiting body will slowly stain or bruise
brownish after handling or cutting. This species is very distinctive because of its
bulb, pileus color, oxidation reaction, and small subglobose spores; however, it has a
history of mistaken identification. Until Atkins‘ recognized it as a distinct species,
it was called A. phalloides in North America. Illustrators went so far as to give it a
globose bulb with limbate volva in their watercolors—because it ought to have had
one! While a number of mycologists have reported it to be edible when cooked,
others warn of confusing it with Amanita rubescens or believe it to be poisonous. We

[@Thalli. All members of the Lecanora subcarnea group are crustose lichens,
which occur on siliceous rocks. The thalli vary from thick to thin, continuous
to rimose-areolate (as in some morphotypes of L. farinacea) or rimose- to
verrucose-areolate as is observed in most species. The areolae vary from plane
to bullate. The thalli are mostly greyish although the colour may vary from
whitish-grey to yellowish-grey, and sometimes greenish-grey or even rusty-
brown (in L. farinacea). Prothalli are either lacking or whitish. The only form#Description*]
[@of vegetative propagules present in the group are soredia (in L. subcarnea var.
soralifera).#Description*]
[@Apothecia. Apothecia are found frequently in most specimens of the group. In
most taxa they are sessile, sometimes adnate (e.g. L. farinacea), but other
species may have fruiting bodies which are constricted at the base (e.g. L.
rhodi). The discs are plane to convex and always heavily pruinose. The colour
of the discs vary from carneous to pinkish, but can be also reddish-orange (e.g.
L. rhodi). When infected by lichenicolous fungi, the discs may become dark
brown in colour.#Description*]
[@The apothecial margins are concolorous with the thallus. In most species they
are prominent and persistent, but in L. rhodi the margins become excluded. In
several specimens heavily flexuose margins can be seen, while others have
entire to flexuose discs. In L. sanctae-helenae the margins remain rather thick
and entire and never become flexuose.#Description*]
[@Thalli. The internal morphology of the thallus is very uniform within the group
and is typical of that observed in Lecanora s.str. An epinecral layer covering
the thallus, an algal layer and the medulla can be distinguished.#Description*]
[@Apothecia. The apothecial margin is composed of the amphi- and parathecium.
The amphithecium contains trebouxioid algae and is rather thick (up to 270 µm
basally) and filled with small crystals, which rapidly or slowly dissolve in
KOH. These crystals are prominent under polarized light (POL+). An amphi-
thecial cortex is absent in most species, but an indistinct cortex is observed in
L. farinacea and L. sanctae-helenae. If present, the cortex is rather thin (25-35
µm) and interspersed with small crystals (POL --), which may or may not
dissolve in KOH. The parathecium always contains small crystals (POL+) and
is 15-20 µm thick.#Description*]
[@Under the microscope the epihymenium appears granular with small greyish to
brownish crystals (POL+). These crystals and their colouration disappear in
KOH. Both the hymenium and the hypothecium are hyaline. The paraphyses
are septate, sparsely branched and slightly thickened apically. The subhyme-
nium may be hyaline or yellowish. Clavate to clavate-cylindrical, eight-spored
asci occur in this group as is the typical of asci in Lecanora s.str. (cf. Hafellner
1984, Hertel & Rambold 1985). The ascospores are always hyaline, non-
septate and ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid.#Description*]
[@While the morphology and anatomy of the L. subcarnea group is not very
variable, chemistry plays an important role in the definition of taxa. Most
chemical segregates can also be distinguished by morphological and anatomical
characters, but these may be subtle or difficult to observe, if one is not familiar
with the taxa. Therefore chemical analysis is an ideal tool for the identification
of species in the L. subcarnea group.#Description*]

[@This variety can be distinguished from Lecanora subcarnea s. str. by the
presence of soredia. The anatomy of the apothecia and the chemistry of the
sorediate morph of L. subcarnea are identical with the typical variety. The
taxonomic recognition of sorediate taxa within the genus Lecanora differs.
While a sorediate morph of L. epibryon was not recognized at any taxonomic
level by Brodo (1984), more recently other sorediate taxa in the L. subfusca
group were treated as species or subspecies by Brodo et al. (1994). Alterna-
tively the varietal rank was chosen by Leuckert & Poelt (1989) for sorediate
taxa in the L. rupicola group. As we have not studied the European material in
detail we prefer to maintain the sorediate morph of L. subcarnea at the variety
level, simply because it was originally described as such by Magnusson.
However, the sporadic occurrence of the sorediate morph throughout the range
of distribution of L. subcarnea s.str. suggests, that var. soralifera is not a
monophyletic entity.#Description*]

collection on Phlox longifolia to C. omphacodes. The leaf spots
and conidia are similar to that of the latter taxon. The conidial

septate, branched, subhyaline, 1-2.5 µm wide. Stromata well-
developed, 25-80 µm in diam, somewhat coloured, pale

[@Colonies on PCA (7 da.) are almost devoid of aerial
non-sporulating mycelium. Essentially all vegetative hyphae
are surface or subsurface, usually inconspicuous, but also
frequently developing as radii of a few parallel, closely
adpressed, euseptate hyphal elements.#Description*]
[@Solitary primary conidiophores arise directly from
surface hyphae or as short lateral branches from variously
decumbent aerial fascicles of a few parallel hyphae (to ca.
1-2mm in length) that have the same appearance as subsurface
adpressed radial elements. Individual conidiophores are
short tubular or somewhat flask-shaped, 0-2 transeptate,
commonly 8-18 x 3-5 µm, seldom more proliferous than 1-
geniculate or l-branched. The conspicuous aerial fascicles
of hyphae bear large numbers of lateral conidiophores and,
after their long chains of conidia are produced, have the
appearance (50X) of an over-used bottlebrush. Colonies#Description*]

tan pigment of massed hyphae and conidia.#Description*]
[@Conidia are produced acropetally in long, straight,
narrow, branching chains, resulting in open, bushy tufts of
conidia and conidiophores. Nearly all but new terminal
conidia are ca. 18-22 x 3-4(-5)µm, regardless of their
position in a chain. They are narrowly ellipsoid, becoming
barely narrow-ovoid. A few conidia exhibit (780X) 1-3
transverse eusepta; none have longitudinal septa. Color is
dilute tan with 2-3 transverse hyaline discontinuities in
positions where septa later may be formed.#Description*]
[@The apex of each conidium (other than terminal) in a
chain functions as a secondary conidiophore. This conidi-
ogenous apex appears superficially to be undifferentiated
from the spore body. Usually, however, it is identifiable
as a slightly constricted, pale region ca. 1.5 x 2 µm. This
small apical secondary conidiophore often proliferates
laterally, at which time it looks typically alternarioid and
serves as the origin of a new branch in the conidial chain.#Description*]

individual conidial bush may have 100 or more spores; an
aerial fascicle of conidiophorogenous hyphae can be estimated
to bear several hundred to a few thousand conidia.#Description*]

da. of development and produce chains of narrow, indistinctly

obovate or obclavate, reach a size range of ca. 40-50 x 7-
9 µm, and are 5-8 transeptate and sometimes 1 longitudinally
septate in one of the central segments; color is a dilute
tan. Sporulating hyphae do not dominate Cz colonies after
ca. 7 da; instead, abundant non-sporulating aerial mycelium
takes on the texture and smoky grey color of mouse fur.#Description*]

[@Alternaria incomplexa is included here near A. cetera
only because a high percentage of its conidia do not develop
beyond a juvenile 0-3 transeptate stage under routine culture
conditions. The sporulation pattern on PCA is similar to
that of the A. infectoria group (Simmons 1986c, 1994b) in
that some of the conidia in any clump of abundantly branched
chains are relatively long pseudorostrate. Typically, the
initial conidium basal to a sporulation clump, and two to a
few other conidia that serve as branching elements in spore
chains, are larger, more septate, and more. strongly
ornamented than the general population. In addition, these
larger obclavate conidia terminate in branching or geniculate
secondary conidiophores that may be as long as the spore
bodies that generate them. These conidia, which make up a
very low percentage of total sporulation units, have a size
range (excluding pseudorostra) of ca. 30-40 x 8-13 µm and are
5-8 transeptate with 0-4 longitudinal septa. Perhaps 95% or
more of any sporulation clump consists of ovoid or obclavate
units that have a size range of ca. 18-25 x 5-8 µm, 3(-5)
transverse and 0O(-1) longitudinal septa, and secondary
conidiophore pseudorostra sometimes as long as the spore body
but usually limited to one short cell.#Description*]
[@Colonies on PCA lack aerial non-sporulating mycelium.

[@Colonies of A. pseudorostrata on PCA are composed of
fine, dark, radiating, surface and subsurface hyphae without
appreciable amounts of non-sporulating aerial mycelium.
Conidiophores originate in abundance near the agar surface,
forming an open stand; they are relatively sturdy in ap-
pearance, semi-erect, simple or commonly 1-branched, some-
times proliferating at 1-2 conidiogenous sites, medium brown,
with a dominant size range of ca. 150-400 x 6-8 µm. Simple
chains of as many as 10 (usually 3-6) conidia are produced.
Chains may branch by means of two conidiogenous sites in an
intercalary pseudorostrum, but usually do not do so.#Description*]
[@The initial conidium in an A. pseudorostrata chain
commonly has a slightly larger spore body than others in the
chain. All conidia (except the terminal one in a chain) have
a well-defined pseudorostrum but never a true, non-conidi-
ogenous beak. Sometimes the primary conidium also has the
longest pseudorostrum, but this is by no means the rule,
particularly in chains of 7-10 units, where some other
intercalary spore may produce the longest false beak.#Description*]
[@The spore body of A. pseudorostrata conidia is narrowly
ellipsoid or ovoid in youth, becoming narrowly to broadly
ellipsoid, 55-90 x 14-20 µm, dilute to medium yellowish-brown,
smooth-walled to distinctly and evenly punctate-rough
overall, with up to 8-1l transepta and 1-2 longitudinal or
oblique septa in several of the broadest transverse segments.
Young beakless conidia have a rounded to acute apex. The
apical cell generates a secondary conidiophore usually 60-
100 µm long but often as long as 240 µm. The developing
pseudorostrum is pale, ca. 3 µm diam., maturing through most
or all of its length with several transepta, enlarging to ca.
4-5 µm diam., and becoming concolorous with its conidial base.#Description*]

[@are connected in chains through the agency of sturdy apical
secondary conidiophores. Both taxa produce their secondary
beak structures after the initial erostrate shape of the
conidium body has been defined (and, I suspect, probably
before it has reached its mature dimensions, a suspicion very
difficult to prove). Conidium dimensions of A. pseudo-
rostrata and A. euphorbiicola overlap, but septation and
ornamentation are not the same. Cultures of these two taxa
are quite different from each other macroscopically, as are
the 50X appearances of chain formation, as follows.#Description*]
[@Colonies of A. pseudorostrata on PCA and V-8 are an
uninterrupted turf of long primary conidiophores arising from
close but distinct radiating hyphae near the agar surface.
Very abundant but uncrowded long conidiophores generate
conidial chains whose extraordinary lengths derive as much
from the length of intercalary secondary conidiophores as
they do from the lengths of the incorporated (3-10) conidia.
The long chains eventually (by 10-14 da.) become entangled
thickets, but in early days are seen as separate, semi-erect
catenulae.#Description*]
[@Colonies of A. euphorbiicola on PCA comprise a poorly
defined subhyaline mycelium which, unlike that of A. pseu-
dorostrata, bears very dark, concentric sporulation rings as
the visible response to the alternating light/dark regimen
routinely used. Colony appearance on V-8 also suggests
concentric rings of sporulation, except that on this medium
sporulation is much more abundant and crowded than on PCA.
Primary conidiophores from surface hyphae are crowded,
commonly are shorter by at least half than those of A.
pseudorostrata, and bear chains of only 2-3 conidia. The 50X
aspect of A. euphorbiicola chains never approaches the
dramatically long, pseudorostrate appearance presented
consistently by A. pseudorostrata. A. euphorbiicola conidia
have smooth walls and a more open septation pattern (fewer
septa) than is found in rough-spored A. pseudorostrata.#Description*]

[@Colonies of A. rostellata on PCA are composed of fine,
dark, radiating, surface and subsurface hyphae without
appreciable amounts of non-sporulating aerial mycelium. The
growth pattern is of concentric rings, which correspond with
the imposed diurnal light/dark regimen. Dark rings (viewed
at 50X) are composed of abundant, short, crowded, simple or
branched conidiophores with a single dark conidium terminat-
ing each conidiophore. Lighter rings that alternate with the
densely conidial dark ones are composed of very long, erect
or variously ascendant, branched conidiophores also with a
conidium terminating each branch.#Description*]
[@Conidiophores in the dark rings usually are ca. 150-200
x 6.5 µm; individual conidiogenous branches in the lighter
rings are about the same length but arise from a much longer,
sturdy, ascendant primary conidiophore axis.#Description*]
[@Most conidia of A. rostellata remain solitary. Short
chains of two conidia are produced but are very uncommon in
the overall spore population. Young conidia are narrow-
ovoid; fully developed ones mostly ellipsoid to broadly
ovoid, with a broadly rounded base cell and a blunt to
subacute apex. Each conidium typically generates a narrow
eurostrum from the apical cell. This beak may begin
development either while a conidium still is juvenile with
only a few transverse septa or later when the conidium base
has reached almost full development.#Description*]
[@Conidia reach full development in a size range of ca.
50-80 x 20-30 µm, with 7-9 transverse septa and 1-3 longi-
tudinal septa in several of the broadest transverse segments,
and with outer walls smooth to moderately punctate-rough and
a dilute tawny brown, becoming more complexly cellular and
dark brown in age. There is an abrupt break in the contour
of the conidium apex where it gives rise to the narrow beak.
The beak is subhyaline and ca. 30-55 x 2 µm or usually
shorter. Occasionally a filamentous beak enlarges terminally
into a secondary conidiophore ca. 9 x 5 µm, initiating a 2-
conidium chain. Sometimes a relatively broad secondary
conidiophore up to ca. 40 x 6 µm develops directly from the#Description*]
[@conidium apex and generates a secondary conidium without
interposition of a true beak. The conspicuous and character-
istic condition, however, is of solitary conidia lacking or,
predominantly, furnished with a short, stiff filamentous
eurostrum.#Description*]
[@Conidia of the original isolate and in various
herbarium specimens (Simmons 1994a) exhibit a prominent
character of spore wall ornamentation that persists
throughout development of "pale golden tan" conidia and tends
to obscure (obtecta) the internal pattern of septation.#Description*]
[@Juvenile conidia of the recent New Zealand isolates are
pale and without transepta, or with only 2-3 faint indica-
tions of septum position. Although young smooth conidia
usually become completely and closely punctulate when
transverse segments first appear, this obtectant ornamenta-
tion becomes less masking as conidia enlarge. A yellowish
brown pigment develops in major septa to a degree not found
in the type isolate; it contrasts strongly with the dilute
color of the spore body.#Description*]
[@Fully developed conidia of these recent isolates may
appear quite smooth, with septation pattern not at all
obscured, or they may be completely punctate-rough. Others
may retain limited surface areas of punctulation or simply
bear scattered granulations. In any case, the type character
of obscurant ornamentation is reduced or lost. Ironically,
the type illustration (Simmons 1994a, Fig. 77) is a better
depiction of the recent New Zealand isolates than of the
earlier type in that, for reasons of laziness, conidium
ornamentation, though mentioned, was not drawn for most
spores in the figure.#Description*]
[@Characters of conidium size, pattern of septation, and
beak formation are the same in all isolates of A. obtecta#Description*]
[@seen thus far. Two characters illustrated with the type
description (Simmons, l.c.) are reviewed here as aids in
distinguishing A. obtecta from other large-spored euphorbi-
icolous taxa. These characters are a somewhat ladder-like
pattern of transverse distoseptation evident in many conidia,
and the obvious failure of eusepta to form across many of the
distoseptum interfaces.#Description*]
[@A "ladder" pattern of parallel transverse septa is seen
best in long-ellipsoid conidia of A. obtecta, from young
through mature spores; it may dominate the image even after
longitudinal septa become visible. The "ladder rungs"
initially, and often persistently, are simply the interfaces
of adjacent transverse cells; true septa contiguous with the
conidium wall are not observable at this stage.#Description*]
[@True septa usually are produced across only a few of
the interfaces as these initially distoseptate conidia
mature. Other interfaces remain distoseptate, i.e., without
interposed transverse eusepta, even in fully mature conidia.#Description*]
[@The same progression is seen in formation of longi-
tudinal septa. Initial, relatively indistinct longitudinal
walls are interfaces that arise when broad tranverse cells
divide into smaller rounded units. Sometimes longitudinal
eusepta are generated through the distoseptum interface, but
this progression to euseptation is by no means the rule
throughout the A. obtecta conidium body.#Description*]

[@basidiospores are important features in recognizing the Auriscalpiaceae. However,
loss of either gloeocystidia (or gloeoplerous hyphae) or amyloid basidiospores in
some members can be found (e.g., Amylosporomyces, Clavicorona S.s.,
Mucronella). The acceptance of them in the Auriscalpiaceae is based on other
combined features. However, sufficient evidence is needed in searching

[@The color of the epithecial pigment varies from olive-green to almost blue--
green. It reacts HCl+ blue, HNOgsoq,+ pink. In their earliest stages the
apothecia are aspicilioid and immersed in the thallus areoles. The surroun-
ding thallus develops a whitish-pruinose, raised rim, which soon develops
into a black proper margin. This development forms a transition between
lecideine or biatorine and lecanorine margination, a situation not known
before in Miriquidica. Similar transitions are common in various genera of
crustose lichens, e.g., Schaereria.#Description*]

[@Some mature conidia can proliferate at the apex and produce new conidia. We
describe this phenomenon as a false branching; a new conidiogenous locus is produced
from the conidial apex, when the conidium, instead of seceding, remains in contact with
the conidiogenous cell. This can be possibly ascribed to a high level of moisture
occurring during the fructification (Gams, pers. comm ).#Description*]

[@Comments: We are convinced that our record is identical with
Cortinarius blattoi Mazza, recently described from subalpine forests in northern Italy.
However, we must have some reservations because we were unable to obtain the type
collection for comparison, in spite of several attempts. Cortinarius blattoi is closely
related to C. praestans Cord. and has several characters in common with it, including
the coloration of pileus and veil, the often wrinkled pileus surface and the compact
context. C. blattoi has smaller basidiomata and much smaller spores than C. praestans.
It has on the other side the typical KOH reaction in common with the group of C.
balteatus. Cortinarius duvissimus (Mos.) Mos. is an other European species in this#Description*]

of Kauffman came from Houghton, Michigan, 22 Jul. 1906, collected in maple and
birch ravines. This is different from the typical habitat. The spores are more
heterogeneous and seem partly immature. Also the painting is less convincing. A
collection of H.E.Bigelow det. A.H.Smith (Smith 48279) from Mt. Rainier National
Park, Washington, has similar smaller spores but is still in the range of variability for
C. umidicola. In addition there are some cheilocystidia. However, some banal ,
mostly cylindric to clavate types oft sterile cells in Telamonia are a rather inconstant
character and depend often on weather conditions during the development of the
basidiomata. There is also a painting by C.H.Kauffman under the name "C. plumiger
Fr." from North Elba, Adirondack Mountains, under spruce and birch, 14-09-1914.
This collection is strikingly similar to C. smidicola and the spores agree well with
those of C. umidicola. The protologue of Fries for C. plumiger differs, however, in
several points. Fries calls the veil "candidus" and the squamules on the pileus
"floccose-plumosis densis albis", the color of the pileus "udus fuscescens subolivaceus,
siccus testaceo-alutaceus" which suggests a much stronger hygrophanity as observed
in C. umidicola.#Description*]

with the following distribution of mating types among the spores.#Description*]
[@Stromata erumpent from bark tissue, partially immersed and pustular or
largely exposed and discoid; surface dull yellowish brown, dull ochraceous
brown, dull reddish brown, or dark brown, rugose to rugulose, pruinose or not,
split into stellate pattern in some species due to ostiolar protrusion and
ascomatal expansion; tissue immediately beneath surface with the same
color as the surface, waxy or non-waxy, with or without KOH-extractable
pigments; tissue beneath gray to grayish brown, soft, composed entirely of
pseudoparenchymatous fungal tissue. Ascomata small, spherical to ovate,
usually monostichous, ultimately shrunken and detached from the
surrounding stromatal tissue when dry, in valsoid to diatrypoid configurations
Ostioles slightly projecting above stromatal surface, black, smooth. Asci with
eight ascospores arranged in uniseriate manner, cylindrical, short-stipitate,
persistent, with apical apparatus faintly visible by light microscopy but, in
some species, dome-shaped and fluorescing in the fluorescence brightener,
Calcofluor (see Rogers, 1975 for procedure). Ascospores light brown, brown
to dark brown, two-celled, ellipsoid, with narrowly to broadly rounded ends,
constricted or unconstricted at septum, with fine reticulation, or with coarse
reticulation sometimes tending to be longitudinally ribbed on some
ascospores. Germination site, appendages, and sheath lacking.
Hamathecial elements paraphysate, long, hypha-like, septate, seldom
branched, with free ends oriented towards the ostiole.#Description*]
[@A general life cycle of Valsaria is as follows.#Description*]
[@Ascospores germinate by producing yeast-like budding cells or, less
frequently, by producing germ tubes. This is followed by the production of
hyphae directly from which one-celled, hyaline conidia are produced
holoblastically. This stage is Hormonema-like. Sometimes, conidiogenous
loci proliferate percurrently. Hyphae frequently disarticulate into
arthroconidium-like cells. Subsequently, Cytosporella-like conidiomata are
formed in most taxa except for V. rubricosa. These conidiomata bear
another type of conidium which is one-celled, hyaline, extremely small.
These conidia have not been seen to germinate, and may eventually be
proven to be spermatia. Conidiogenous cells have minute collarettes and are
thickened periclinally, and sometimes are annellated. Teleomorphs are
known to be produced only in cultures of V. rubricosa.#Description*]
[@Stromata erumpent subepidermally, pulvinate, rounded, 0.5-0.9 mm diam

brown, split in stellate pattern; tissue immediately beneath surface forming a
thin crust, ca. 0.1 mm thick, blackish; tissue beneath dull grayish brown, soft.
Ascomata ovate, 0.1 mm diam x 0.3-0.4 mm high, in valsoid configuration.
Ostioles emerging convergently into black papillae ca. 0.1 mm diam. Asci
140-155 µm in total length x 15-17 µm broad, nearly sessile, with apical
apparatus undetected by light microscopy but barrel-shaped when mounted in
Calcofluor and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Ascospores light
brown to brown, two-celled, ellipsoid, usually with narrowly rounded ends,
unconstricted at septum, 17-25 x 9-12 µm, coarsely reticulated to
longitudinally ribbed. Ascospores germinating by budding off yeast-like
conidia or producing germ hyphae.#Description*]
[@Valsaria bambusae produces two types of conidia in culture: small
phialoconidia in the Cytosporella-like synanamorph and large blastoconidia
in the Hormonema-like synanamorph. The phialoconidia are collectively dull
orange and are only found in conidiomatal locules, whereas the blastoconidia
are collectively opalescent and can be found both on the surface of mycelia
and in conidiomatal locules. The life cycle of V. bambusae resembles that of
V. insitiva except for some conidiomatal locules producing blastoconidia.
The conidiomatal locules of V. insitiva produce only phialoconidia.#Description*]

[@Lepiota procera var. fuliginosa, described from Mediterranean France (Barla

of original material (Trimbach 1996). According to mycologists with a vast
Mediterranean experience (Bellù & Lanzoni 1987, Candusso & Lanzoni 1990,
Bon 1993, Migliozzi 1995), this taxon comes very close to Macrolepiota procera
from which it diﬀers mainly in the darker tinged pileus and stipe, the hardly
disrupted stipe covering, and the browning context. These authors describe
the pileipellis of M. fuliginosa as a trichoderm made up of thin-walled to

[@Thallus characters — In pure culture, isolate JEL596 has morphological
characters similar to Karling’s (1941, 1977) descriptions of C. johnstonii. On
agar, germlings developed endogenously, forming catenulate swellings at a
single axis or multiple rhizoidal axes (Fig. 1A, B). The catenulations and the
spherical base of what would become the zoosporangium developed relatively#Description*]
[@slowly as the rhizoidal system expanded through the agar (Fig. 1B). After nearly
two weeks, one side of the spherical zoosporangium elongated to form a tube
nearly as wide as the spherical base (Fig. 1E). Most of the cytoplasm migrated
toward the apical portion of the broad tube, leaving a highly vacuolated portion
at the zoosporangium base (Fig. 1F, I). At maturity, the basal portion of the
zoosporangium was empty and may have been walled oﬀ by a septum (Fig. 1F).
Zoospores exited the zoosporangium through a pore made by the complete
detachment of an apical operculum (Fig. 1H). Zoospores possessed a single
lipid globule (Fig. 1G, H), and ﬂagella were ~35 μm long.
Our attempts to reintroduce C. johnstonii to onionskin led to the production
of germlings, but after 1 month, no further development occurred. On onionskin
isolate JEL596 developed exogenously. The amber, ovoid zoospore cyst on the
surface of the onionskin had a cell wall with ridges and generally possessed a
single, large lipid globule (Fig. 1C). Germlings possessed one or two rhizoidal
axes with catenulations (Fig. 1D).#Description*]

Notes: Exserticlava species are separated primarily based on conidial shape
and number of septa (Holubová-Jechová 1990). A key to species and a synopsis
of their characters were provided by Tsui et al. (2001a). Of the six previously
described Exserticlava species, E. manglietiae resembles E. globosa V. Rao & de
Hoog (Rao & de Hoog 1986) in possessing concolorous, thick-walled conidia
with a strictly median septum, but E. globosa produces spherical larger (17 ×
21 μm diam) verrucose conidia. Exserticlava uniseptata Bhat & B. Sutton and
E. yunnanensis L. Cai & K.D. Hyde also produce 1-septate conidia, but E.
uniseptata can be distinguished by its broadly obovoid, larger conidia (15–20 ×
11–14 μm) with a smaller basal cell and E. yunnanensis diﬀers in hemispherical,
pale brown to subhyaline, larger conidia (16–22 × 10–13 μm) with a smaller
apical cell.#Description*]

[@Thallus with three or more widely distributed rhizoidal axes. Multiple, short to
long tubular discharge papillae.
Expanded Description — The generation time for H. polyrhiza on
mPmTG nutrient agar is 2–3 days at 23 °C. In motion, zoospores are spherical
(Fig. 2h, arrowhead) and contain a single lipid globule near the base of the
ﬂagellum (Fig. 2a). They encyst and within 24 h form a thallus with multiple
rhizoidal axes (Fig. 2b). At maturity rhizoids can extend to more than twice
the diameter of the zoosporangium (Fig. 2c); distally rhizoids are ﬁne (<0.5
µm) and isodiametric, but near the thallus they are slightly swollen (Fig. 2d).
Zoosporangia form discharge papillae (Figs. 2e, f) within 52 hr, with the
number of papillae increasing with size of the zoosporangia. Papillae may be
barely raised (Fig. 2f), short tubes (Fig. 2e) or, in crowded conditions, long
tubes (Fig. 2g). Zoospores are elongate when discharged (arrows, Fig. 2h) but
soon become spherical (dia 3.5–4.5 µm with ﬂagellum up to 28 µm).
Ultrastructural characters — The ultrastructure (Figs 3a–e) of
the H. polyrhiza zoospore is nearly identical to Barr’s illustration of a typical
Rhizophydium zoospore (Barr & Hadland-Hartmann 1978). A membranebound aggregation of ribosomes is in the center of the zoospore, outside of
which are the nucleus, a single lobed mitochondrion, and a single lipid globule
(Figs. 3a, b). A lobe of a mitochondrion is often anterior to the kinetosome

[@
(Fig. 3a). The microbody is appressed to the side of the lipid globule toward the
center of the zoospore (Fig. 3b), and a rumposome (= fenestrated cisterna of
Letcher et al. 2004) is appressed to the lipid near the surface of the cell (Fig. 3b).
The non-ﬂagellated centriole is parallel to the kinetosome and joined to it by a
bridge of partly overlapping ﬁbers centrally located between the two structures
(Figs. 3c, d; arrow); the ﬁbrils form a wide (>0.075 µm) zone of convergence. The
non-ﬂagellated centriole is shorter than its width (Figs. 3c, e). A microtubular
root, composed of separate, parallel microtubules, extends from the side of the
kinetosome to the rumposome (Fig. 3e). A terminal plate is in the lumen of

[@Comments — The pattern of ontogeny in Alveariospora can be classiﬁed as
conidial development type 17 (Kirk et al. 2008) (holoblastic, delimitation by 1
septum, schizolytic secession, maturation by diﬀuse wall-building, percurrent
enteroblastic conidiogenous cell extension, followed by conidial ontogeny by
replacement apical wall-building; strongly melanized, each successive conidium
seceding before the next percurrent elongation of the conidiogenous cell), but
sometimes also holoblastic, sympodial proliferation occurring and two or more
conidia are produced, a pattern of ontogeny classiﬁed as conidial development
type 10 (holoblastic, regularly alternating with sympodial proliferation,
maturation by diﬀuse wall-building and secession schizolytic).
The mode of rectilinear proliferation and the combination of conspicuous
annular structures and thickened, darkened conidiogenous loci in Alveariospora
distoseptata is very unusual and comparable only with Annellophragmia Subram.

the last species, inhabiting a sooty mould in New Zealand, is characterized
by synnematous conidiomata and euseptate conidia. Annellophragmia is

tinct smell. Spore print black with a very slightly violaceous or purple tinge. This could
be an additional character for the whole group, but since it is almost impossible to make a

[@Characteristic for the species in subsect. Alachuani is the structure of the veil, as indi-
cated in the introduction and key to the subsections. The veil is composed of filamentous
hyphae that are weakly to strongly diverticulate. This means that most hyphae have wart-
or finger-like excrescences. Sometimes these excrescences are branched again, which we
call multiple-branched in this paper.#Description*]

malt extraction agar (MEA) and 50 mm on oatmeal agar (OA) after 6 weeks (room temper-
ature, diffuse daylight). Acrial mycelium rather felty on MEA 2% and 4%, but almost
lacking or restricted to the centre of the colony on OA. Aerial and submerged mycelium
soon turn ochraceous, developing shades of rose and purple with age, most strikingly on
MEA. Colony reverse shows similar colour and distinct furrows which radiate from the
centre in an irregular pattern. After about 4 weeks scattered pustulate aggregations of
white mycelium appearing on OA, resulting in sterile apothecia.#Description*]

[@General — Asci numerous, broadly cylindric-clavate with a short broad stalk and a

with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The wall is undifferentiated and of constant thickness, 55—70 nm, in
both lateral and apical parts. Special activity at the site of the future subapical ring was not
observed. There is an outer stratum of strong reactivity 27—32 nm thick and an inner stra-
tum of lower reactivity 32—42 nm thick. A thin reactive periascus is observed from the
beginning and at later stages.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, about 90 nm thick, becomes more clearly delimited, re-
mains rather constant, and consists of a strongly reactive outer stratum 42—46 nm thick
and a moderately reactive inner stratum 37—46 nm thick. After cryo fixation the inner layer
shows little variation in thickness, laterally the thickness is 93-116 nm, in the apex about
185 nm, while it reaches 230-275 nm in the subapical ring.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — While the outer layer remains unchanged, the inner layer
differentiates into two strata, an outer stratum of low reactivity and an inner of strong reactiv-
ity. The latter is up to 162 nm thick in the apex, becomes gradually thinner in the subapical
region and is scarcely distinguishable lower down the lateral wall. At maturity a great ac-
cumulation of wall material is observed in the apex.#Description*]
[@In cryo-fixed material the inner layer increases up to 700 nm and its inner boundary
remains regular and smooth, although vague in the apex; while in chemically fixed mate-
rial it reaches 740 nm and shows a strongly undulated or folded inner stratum.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before dehiscence the ascus wall stretches strongly.
Regular dehiscence occurs in asci with freely exposed ascus tops. Here the more rigid
outer layer breaks with an irregular tear above the level of the subapical ring, which gives
space for the more flexible compressed inner layer to extend through this opening. Imme-
diately, or very soon afterwards, the inner layer also breaks irregularly and the ascospores
are forcibly released. Structurally the actual splitting occurs within the outer stratum of the
inner layer (“couche c’ of Bellemére, 1977). In asci that are not freely exposed this pro-
cess of regular dehiscence is hampered.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, broadly cylindric-clavate with a short stalk and a rounded
apex, reaching 85-110 x 20—25 µm, with 8 smooth spores embedded in a reticulum; the
wall not staining blue with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The wall is rather uniform with a constant thickness of 60—70 nm in
the lateral and apical parts; consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a less reac-
tive inner stratum. An outer floccose, reactive periascus is present. Exactly at the place
where the future subapical ring will be formed a rather conspicuous annulus 930-1200
nm wide and 210—230 nm thick of moderately reactive wall material is deposited on the
inner face of the single layered young wall. In the neighbouring ascoplasm increased ac-
tivity is observed.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 70—80 nm thick, consists of a strongly reactive outer
stratum 18—23 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum 46—56 nm thick. The inner layer
shows a uniform thickness of about 100 nm in the flanks, but reaches 265 nm in the sub-
apical region.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness and reac-
tivity. The inner layer is deposited on the inner face of the outer layer as a secondary wall.
The inner stratum of this layer is more reactive than the outer stratum and forms the main
part of the apical wall with a thickness up to 510 nm. It is clearly fibrillose and often
shows internal regions free of reactive wall material, orientated parallel to the surface of
the apex. Often rather large cavities are formed in the apex, which can be easily demon-
strated with light microscopic stains. On ripening the inner surface of the inner stratum
becomes undulated or folded in the entire apex above the subapical ring. At these stages#Description*]
[@the subapical ring is not easily detected, but it can be seen as the narrow region in the wall
where both strata of the inner layer change rather abruptly in thickness. Just above the
subapical ring a weakened zone in the outer wall layer is often observed.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a short broad stalk and a rounded or
slightly flattened apex, reaching 105-120 x 30-35 µm, with 32 finely verrucose spores;
the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Shortly after early ascosporogenesis a secondary wall can alrcady be
distinguished at the inner face of the outer layer (primary wall). The outer layer is uniform
in contrast and thickness 112—140 nm thick, both apically and laterally.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer decreases in thickness to 80—100 nm when it becomes
strongly extended during further development and remains constant in all parts. It consists
of a strongly reactive outer stratum 26—33 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum about
65 nm thick. The inner layer is clearly delimited from the outer layer by a strongly rcactive
boundary line and shows a thickness of 165—195 nm at the sides and reaches 400 nm in
the subapical ring. In this layer usually a moderately or weakly reactive outer stratum,
200—230 nm thick, and a very thin strongly reactive inner stratum can be distinguished.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — While the outer layer remains constant, all further dif-
ferentiation is observed in the inner layer. Especially in the apical and subapical regions
this layer becomes more stratified. An initially moderately reactive inner stratum occu-
pying the major part of the inner layer differentiates into a complex of three to four
laminae of alternating degrees of reactivity. An intermediate lamina of strong reactivity
becomes prominent in the apex of mature asci, but narrows down and ends in the upper
part of the subapical ring.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — In mature asci sometimes the outer layer becomes eroded,
but protrusion of the inner layer at this site is not observed (Fig. 15b). On the contrary in
many mature asci a gradual disintegration and disappearance of major parts of the inner
layer takes place, at first in the apex above the subapical ring, but then also in the lateral
wall, leaving the subapical ring more or less intact. Finally the inner stratum of the outer
layer is also weakened by disintegration. Then the thin outer layer tears open at the apex
with a bilabiate split or an irregular lid, to discharge the ascus contents. The subapical ring
can still be recognized in the discharged asci by the termination of the strongly reactive
lamina of the inner stratum of the inner layer. After discharge disproportional swelling of
parts of the inner layer is a common phenomenon.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a broad short stalk and a rounded
apex, 115-140 x 40-52 µm, with 64 smooth spores; the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The primary wall is uniform and of constant thickness up to 160 nm
in all parts, consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a less reactive inner stra-
tum. A periascus is not observed. On further development the primary wall becomes the
outer layer of the ascus wall when a secondary wall is deposited as an inner layer against
its inner face.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — While the ascus wall increases in thickness in the apex to 950-1125
nm, and in the subapical ring to 1125-1350 nm, it reaches only 500—675 nm laterally.
The outer layer remains almost constant in thickness, 135—160 nm, with an outer stratum
14—23 nm thick and an inner stratum 110—125 nm thick. In the inner layer, 290—450 nm
thick, an outer stratum of low reactivity, 325—370 nm thick, and a strongly reactive inner
stratum, 65—80 nm thick, can be distinguished.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — Further differentiation of the ascus wall is observed in
the inner layer, while the outer layer remains almost unchanged. In the apical and subapi-
cal region the inner layer becomes more stratified. An initially moderately reactive inner
stratum is differentiated into three lamellae with different reactivity. The ending of an
intermediate lamina of strong reactivity is clearly visible in the upper part of the subapical
ring. Also a well delimited strongly reactive lamina about 75 nm thick can be distinguish-
ed in the innermost part of the inner layer. At the level of the ring increased reactivity is
also observed in a narrow region of the outer stratum of the inner layer close to the outer
layer. In apical and subapical regions the boundary between the inner and outer strata of
the inner layer is vague.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM.#Description*]
[@General — Asci 2—5 in each fruit-body, at first broadly clavate, then subellipsoid to
ovoid with a large dome-shaped apex and without a distinct stalk, 80—160 x 60—90 µm,
with 256 smooth spores; the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The primary wall shows a rather simple fine structure consisting of a
strongly reactive outer stratum and a weakly reactive inner stratum throughout the whole
ascus. During early ascosporogenesis an inner layer of weak reactivity is formed at the
inner face of the primary wall. A regular periascus is not observed.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — During further development the primary wall becomes the outer layer
and remains rather constant in thickness 140—160 nm in all parts and consists of a strongly
reactive outer stratum 45-60 nm thick and an only moderately reactive inner stratum 90—
115 nm thick. The inner layer with a thickness of 480—680 nm is of low reactivity at first,
but later at its inner side a strongly reactive lamina, 55—70 nm thick, becomes distinct.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — Further differentiation is mainly restricted to the inner
layer which becomes more stratified in the apical and subapical regions. A rather strongly
rcactive internal lamina in the apex ends in the upper part of the subapical ring. The rest of
the ring is always of low reactivity and sometimes a vague lamellation is observed. While
the lateral and apical wall are about 770 nm in thickness, in the ring it reaches 910 nm.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM, but light microscopic
Observations show a protrusion of the inner layer trough an irregular rupture of the outer
layer at the apex, and finally a rupture of the inner layer releasing the ascospores (Fig. 4a).#Description*]
[@General — In cach fruit-body there is usually only a single shortly ellipsoid to ovoid
ascus with a large dome-shaped apex and without a stalk, 165—230 x 120-175 µm, with
2000 to over 3000 smooth spores; the wall is not blued with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Shortly after early mitotic divisions prior to ascosporogenesis the
ascus expands and the thickness of the ascan wall increases markedly. An internal weakly
reactive layer develops at the inner face of the primary wall which becomes the outer layer
consisting of a strongly reactive outer stratum and a moderately reactive inner stratum. A
perispore is not clearly observed.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — On further development the outer layer remains constant in appearance
and shows a thickness of about 210 nm in the lateral and subapical region. A strongly
reactive outer stratum of about 50 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum 140—170 nm
thick can be distinguished at all stages. The inner layer is still less reactive, except for a
55—70 nm thick inner stratum, and is very variable in thickness, because of extreme
swelling of its outer stratum. This stratum shows a fibrillar fine structure with elements
parallel to the ascus surface, from 1.2—2.5 µm thick in ripening asci reaching sometimes
more than 9 µm in fully mature ones.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — Most differentiation is restricted to changes in the inner
layer which shows changes in the thickness and also variation in stratification. Because
of this the wall is only 910-980 nm in the apex and increases to more than twice this size
in the subapical ring. In the apex and the upper part of the apical ring the presence of a
strongly reactive inner stratum is accentuated. Both in the apical dome and laterally below
the ring a separation of the outer stratum of the inner layer is observed shortly before
maturity. Because of the low reactivity the fibrillar elements can be distinguished only
with difficulty. In the outer and inner part of this stratum the elements are rather densely
packed parallel to the wall surface. In an intervening zone of increasing thickness between
these parts the elements are irregularly arranged, as if torn apart. If almost mature asci are
forcibly crashed a rupture of the outer layer under the level of the subapical ring is fol-
lowed by separation of the ascan wall along this zone.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before full maturity the ascus increases strongly in
size and the fruit-body forcibly opens, usually exposing the top of the ascus. Within the
apex above the subapical ring a slightly protruding central apical dome about 45 µm across
stretches. When the outer layer in the apex opens with an irregular tear the inner layer ex-
tends through an opening of about 50 µm wide. Immediately, or shortly afterwards, the
inner layer also ruptures, releasing the mature ascospores. During dehiscence all parts of
the inner layer may swell enormously.#Description*]
[@General — Asci 10—20 in cach fruit-body, subcylindrical, rather sharply tapering
downwards into a short stalk, with a rounded or somewhat conical top, with 500—1000
smooth spores. The wall not staining in iodine; before maturity a central thickened apical
part of the inner layer stains with Waterman’s blue-black ink.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The wall is already thick from the earliest stages studied. Before asco-
sporogenesis the thickness is rather uniform, 1.6—2.1 µm in the lateral and subapical re-
gions, but increases in the apex up to 3.0 µm. The outer layer, 220—240 nm thick, is at#Description*]
[@first rather vaguely delimited, but becomes more distinct later, especially in the apex, by
increased reactivity. The inner layer, 2.3—2.8 µm thick, shows low reactivity, except for
a narrow zone in the apex at about 160 nm below the outer layer. At this early stage a con-
spicuous thickening develops in the central part of the apex in the inner layer. This central
thickening may reach 3.6—6.0 µm in width and is sharply delimited by folds in the subapi-
cal region. At first it shows little or no differentiation, but during early ascosporogenesis
it becomes clearly stratified by the presence of three to four strata of alternating reactivity.
On further ripening the stratification becomes less evident, but can still be seen as fine
horizontal lines. A perispore is not observed at very young stages, but from early asco-
sporogenesis onwards a more or less continuous or fragmented perispore, 200-1000 nm
thick, of reticulate structure and moderate reactivity is present.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 210—240 nm thick, consists of a strongly reactive outer
stratum 35-50 nm thick and a moderately reactive inner stratum 160—185 nm thick. The
inner layer, at first 2.3-2.9 µm thick, decreases in size after stretching of the ascus to
1.6-1.9 µm, and is of low reactivity with a subtle but clear stratification as a continuation
of strata in the apical and subapical regions. In the subapical region no evidence of a sub-
apical ring could be found.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — Differentiation is mainly due to changes in the inner layer.
At maturity this layer becomes folded in the subapical region. When the ascus stretches
the fibrillar structure of the inner layer becomes evident.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — At maturity the outer layer of the ascus together with the
outer non-reactive stratum of the inner layer split and open usually at the centrum of the
apex. The central thickening of the inner layer bulges out through this opening, exposing
its thin reactive stratum. The opening remains rather restricted, 5—7 µm, just wide enough
to expose the central thickening. Later the inner layer breaks along the deep folds border-
ing the thickening and the ascus contents are released.#Description*]
[@Here it was observed that the structural and functional inner and outer layer of the ascus
wall do not fully correspond with each other. The separation takes place within the inner
layer close to the boundary plane of its outer and middle stratum.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, cylindric-clavate with a short stalk and a rounded or slight-
ly flattened apex, 159-300 x 15-35 µm, with 8 smooth ascospores; the wall not staining
blue with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The wall is rather undifferentiated and of constant thickness (140—170
nm) in both lateral and apical parts; consisting of a reactive outer stratum, 55—70 nm thick,
and an inner stratum of low reactivity, 84—100 nm thick.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — On further development the bilayered nature of the ascus wall becomes
obvious. An outer layer (140—180 nm) and an inner layer (420-490 nm) can be distin-
guished, each with an outer and an inner stratum. In the subapical region the inner wall
increases in thickness towards the apex up to 700 nm.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness and reac-
tivity, and a strongly reactive periascus can be distinguished on its outer surface. $ -cond-
ary wall material appears to have been deposited on the inner face of the existing ascus
wall. This is especially obvious in the apical and subapical regions with the presence of an#Description*]
[@often strongly reactive, fibrillose inner stratum of the inner layer, reaching a thickness of
420 nm in the apex, but gradually diminishing in thickness in the subapical region, down
to 40 nm. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and the apex this inner
stratum becomes clearly undulated or folded, except for an apical, central flat region, the
future operculum. On the other hand the outer stratum of the inner layer, which is moder-
ately reactive, reaches its maximal thickness in the subapical region. This annular thicken-
ing corresponds both in position and structure with the subapical ring in other species. In
this laminated outer stratum three to five strata may be distinguished after chemical fixa-
tion and Thiéry reaction.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — The opening is by an operculum at the top. The parting of
the operculum from the ascostome is not a single clear fracturing line. In the inner part the
fracture is at the sharp demarcation between the flat and the undulating regions of the inner
stratum of the inner layer. In the outer part the fracture is at the line where the outer stratum of
the inner layer abruptly diminishes in thickness. In the rather wide zone of overlap (1.4-
1.7 µm) between both parts of the operculum separation of the wall layers can already be
observed before the opening. This separation is located at the external side of the inner
stratum of the inner layer.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a broad base and a short stalk and round-
ed above, finally often slightly flattened, 120-210 x 20-32 µm, with 8 smooth ascospores;
the wall not staining blue with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Not observed with TEM.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 106—115 nm thick, consists of a strongly reactive outer
stratum (46—55 nm) and a weakly reactive
inner stratum (55—64 nm). The inner layer is 46—55 nm thick in the lower part. With this
method of fixation the stratification of the inner layer is less evident than after chemical
fixation. In the subapical region the outer stratum of the inner layer increases considerably
in thickness, up to 830 nm, at the level of the subapical ring.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness and in
contrast; a reactive periascus is present on its outer surface. An inner layer, consisting of
two strata, appears to have been deposited on the internal face of the ascus wall. Its outer
stratum is moderately reactive and becomes weakly stratified in the apex and in the upper
part of the apical wall. Its inner stratum is thickest in the apex, up to 420 nm, and becomes
considerably thinner in the lateral wall towards the base (less than 42 nm), where it be-
comes almost indistinguishable. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and
the apex it becomes strongly undulated or even folded.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — The opening is by an apical operculum. The sharp fractur-
ing line in the inner stratum of the inner layer is at the well marked transition between the
flat and the undulated regions in the apex. While the fracture in the outer part is just above
the subapical ring at the level of the outer delimitation of the undulate region of the inner
stratum. In the operculum the upper part (diam. c. 24 µm) may exceed the lower part
(diam. c. 12.5 µm) considerably on all sides (about 6 µm).#Description*]
[@General — In each fruit-body only a single ovoid to ellipsoid ascus without a stalk and
with a rounded or somewhat flattened apex, 270-400 x 170-250 µm, with over 1000
smooth ascospores; the wall not staining blue with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — The wall is almost undifferentiated and uniform, 1080-1190 nm thick
in the lateral part and only 750—860 nm in the apical part, consisting of a reactive outer
stratum (c. 215 nm thick) and an inner stratum of low reactivity, 540—860 nm thick.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer remains almost constant in thickness and reactivity. A
periascus is not observed. On further differentiation of the ascus wall an inner layer is
formed at the inner face of the already existing outer layer. Practically all further changes
in the ascus wall are due to changes in thickness and differentiation in the inner layer. In
this layer a strongly reactive inner and an only moderately reactive outer stratum can be
distinguished. Within this outer stratum often a finer stratification can often be observed
and, especially in the subapical region, a considerable increase in thickness to more than
2500 nm forms a subapical ring of low reactivity.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — At the inner side of the inner layer an inner stratum of
strongly reactive, parallel fibrillar elements reaches a thickness of 1550 nm in the apex,
but gradually decreases downwards till it becomes almost indistinguishable in the lower
lateral wall. In the transitional zone between the suboperculate region and the apex this
stratum becomes strongly undulate. Shortly before dehiscence the future line of fracturing
can be observed at the delimitation of the flat and the undulated region of this inner stra-
tum (cf. Kimbrough & Benny, 1978: fig. 34).#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Not observed in detail with TEM.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, at first broadly clavate, then more slenderly clavate with a
flattened top, finally clavate with a conical top (‘cigar-shaped’) gradually tapering down-
wards into a rather broad base, 100-150 x 20-30 µm, with 64 fusiform smooth spores;
the wall not staining with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Before early ascosporogenesis the wall is almost undifferentiated and
of constant thickness, 172—280 nm in the lateral and apical parts, consisting of a strongly
reactive outer stratum 45-65 nm thick and an only weakly reactive inner stratum 120-220
nm thick. A strongly reactive periascus 170—260 nm thick is observed from the beginning,
later it becomes thinner, c. 70 nm, and may become partly loosened from the ascus wall.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — Shortly after the beginning of meiosis a secondary wall can be distin-
guished at the inner face of the outer layer and a conspicuous ring-shaped thickening is
formed subapically. The outer layer 190—210 nm thick, consisting of a strongly reactive
outer stratum 45—65 nm thick and a less reactive inner stratum. The inner layer is moder-
ately reactive and not clearly stratified below the level of the ring, except for a 45-65 nm
wide uniform, strongly reactive inner stratum. In the subapical region the inner layer
strongly increases in thickness to 600—925 nm to form a ring that may reach a width of
1.4 µm and a height of 3.1—4.4 µm. The reactivity in the inner layer varies from low to#Description*]
[@moderate and four strata of different reactivity may be distinguished in the ring and sub-
apically; in the extreme apex only two strata are seen.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — After karyogamy the apical wall increases strongly in
thickness and may reach 1000 nm, but on further ripening it decreases to a thickness of
about 490 nm. At maturity the top above the ring becomes more or less conical in shape
with a small flattened central region. In the apex the outer stratum of the outer layer re-
mains constant at 45—60 nm, while the inner stratum decreases in thickness towards the
apex from 138 nm near the ring to 45 nm in the central flattened part.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — Shortly before dehiscence the ascus stretches strongly and
the wall in the apex becomes thinner. Weakening of the inner layer is observed in the cen-
tral part by breaking down of wall material. An apical disk or operculum 2.5—3.0 µm in
diameter is differentiated by decreased thickness of the outer layer and a more dense and
granular structure of the inner layer as opposed to a fibrillar structure of the bordering
wall. At dehiscence the operculum tears loose along a circular line and initiates from there
downwards a bilabiate split of the apex above the thick resistant ring and the ascus con-
tents are forcibly ejected.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, at first broadly clavate with a somewhat flattened top, finally
more slenderly clavate with a conical top ('cigar-shaped') gradually tapering downwards
into a rather broad base, 80-120 x 22-25 µm, with 32 fusiform smooth spores, 12-13 x
3—4 µm; the wall not blued with iodine.#Description*]
[@The ultrastructure and the dehiscence of the ascus are found to be exactly the same as
described above for Ascozonus woolhopensis, but certain stages, just at the beginning of
the opening of the operculum, were only observed in this species (Fig. 10c, d).#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, broadly clavate with a short broad stalk and a dome-shaped
apex, 27-35 x 6.7-9.0 µm, with 8 ornamented ascospores; the wall not staining blue with
iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Not studied with TEM.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — The outer layer, 78-90 nm thick, consists of a thin strongly reactive
outer stratum and a less reactive inner stratum. The inner layer, 210—235 nm thick, shows
no clear stratification and is moderately reactive.#Description*]
[@Subapical region — While the outer layer remains almost constant in thickness over the
whole ascus, the inner layer increases rather abruptly in thickness, up to 670—750 nm, in
the subapical and apical regions.#Description*]
[@Immature ascus — The inner layer occupies the major part of the apex and shows little
internal differentiation. The subapical annulus, which was observed by light microscopy
and interference contrast (van Brummelen, 1992, figs. 2 c, d) could not be verified with
electron microscopy.#Description*]
[@Mature ascus — Without significant changes. Only in the transitional region between
the lateral and the apical part of the wall the inner layer is often undulated or folded.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — The central region of the apex is weakened and opens either
subcentrally or with an irregular tear. Within the inner layer a separation of strata is ob-
served. The outer layer is partly eroded. The protrusion of the expanding inner layer
through the outer layer is restricted to a zone 1.4—-1.9 µm wide. At this stage a central part
of the inner stratum in the inner layer shows increased reactivity.#Description*]
[@By light microscopy it was observed (van Brummelen, 1992), that the outer layer stains
with Congo red and that in the inner layer a small central zone at the apex stains with
Watermann's blue-black ink.#Description*]
[@General — Asci numerous, cylindric-clavate with a short stalk and a rounded or some-
what flattened apex, 70-110 x 15-20 µm, with eight smooth ascospores; the wall not
staining blue with iodine.#Description*]
[@Young ascus — Not observed.#Description*]
[@Lateral wall — At the later stages the wall is rather constant in thickness 420—480 nm
in the lower part and reaching 580 nm in the subapical region. It consists of an outer layer
of low reactivity 400—520 nm thick and an inner more reactive layer 45—50 nm thick be-
low and 90—210 nm subapically. The inner layer is clearly separated by a reactive bound-
ary line from the outer layer, but internally is not stratified.#Description*]
[@Ripening and mature ascus — The outer layer remains constant in thickness c. 469 nm
and low reactivity, only in the apical and subapical regions a thin outer stratum, 29-35 nm
thick, of moderate reactivity can be distinguished. A strongly reactive floccose periascus,
85-175 nm thick, covers its outer surface, especially in the upper part of the ascus. The
inner layer which is not clearly differentiated in an inner and outer stratum, is most evident
in the apex 230—275 nm thick and in the subapical region where it gradually diminishes in
thickness to about 45 nm. In the transitional zone between the subapical region and the
apex the inner layer becomes clearly undulated or folded, except for an apical, central flat
region, the future operculum. Only a slight annular thickening can be observed in the sub-
apical wall region of the mature ascus. No differentiation of the wall is found at the level
where in species of Pyronemataceae a subapical ring is formed.#Description*]
[@Dehiscence mechanism — The dehiscence is by an apical operculum regularly shaped
and about 10 µm wide. The fracture starts at the inner face of the inner layer at a rather
sharp demarcation between the flat and undulated regions. Often in mature asci a fissure
can be observed in the inner layer at the apical side of a less swollen region c. 300—500
nm wide with a more reactive inner face (Fig. 12b-e, between arrow-heads). The weak-
ened zone for fracturing in the outer layer is close to the fissure in the inner layer. The
fracturing lines in both layers are close together, thus producing relatively smooth margins
at the operculum and the ascostome. Although the folding of the inner layer in the subapi-
cal region is considerable, a separation of both wall layers in that region is not observed.
After dehiscence the ascus wall near the ascostome swells considerably (Fig. 12e).#Description*]
[@In asci that could ripen and open undisturbed, without pressure from outside, all open-
ed with a very regular and sharply delimited operculum of more than 100 µm diameter
(Figs. 13d, e; cf. Kimbrough, 1966a: fig. Ih; Samuelson & Kimbrough, 1978b: fig. 7).
In the last phase of ripening the protruding top of the ascus gradually diminishes in thick-
ness. The decrease in thickness is observed both in the inner and the outer layer, but is
most extreme in the outer one. At a certain moment during stretching of the wall in the top
the outer layer no longer follows the inner layer and remains behind, leaving the central
part free. A very sharp and regular circular border of the thin outer layer is observed. On#Description*]
[@further increase of the ascus turgor the opening of the top starts exactly along this circular
line. A movement of the inner and outer layer relative to each other is not clearly observed.
Near the line of dehiscence no indentation of the wall, nor any indication of a subapical
ring is present. In mature ascospores no oil-drops or air-bubbles were found.#Description*]

[@The general characters of this variety in vitro are similar to those of Phoma macro-
stoma var. macrostoma. The differentiation in vitro is based on the absence of the red-
violet pigment in the cytoplasm and guttules of the hyphal cells. As a result, the colony
on OA is colourless. However, pale grey olivaceous/dull green sectors in a stellate
pattern may occur. The conidial exudate is white to buff/rosy buff. The NaOH spot
test is negative. On MA the colony is primrose/olivaceous buff, often with pale honey
olivaceous sectors. On CA the general colony colour is colourless to pale greenish oliva-
ceous/olivaceous in a stellate pattern.#Description*]
[@Description in vitro#Description*]
[@A detailed description of morphology in vitro has been given in a provisional treat-
ment dealing with Phoma species producing dendritic crystals (Noordeloos et al., 1993).
Distinctive are the white, bryoid, dendritic crystals, consisting of brefeldin A, produced
on malt agar after 7 days. Chlamydospores are occasionally produced in old cultures.
The growth-rate on OA and MA is moderate, 35—45 mm after 7 days. Conidia are
unicellular, rarely 1-septate, S—7(—12.5) x 1.5—4 µm, subcylindrical, Q = 1.5-3.5. The
type variety of P. medicaginis does not produce any septate conidia in vivo. At low
temperatures this absence of septate conidia is the most conspicuous character dis-
tinguishing it from var. macrospora (no. 7b), which may produce 10-63% relatively
large septate conidia in winter (Róssner, 1968). Both varieties also differ in patho-
genicity.#Description*]
[@Characteristics in vitro#Description*]
[@On agar media at room temperature the mainly aseptate conidia of P. medicaginis
var. macrospora are not essentially larger then those of the type variety medicaginis.
The varietal epithet macrospora refers to the relatively large 1—3-septate conidia (up
to 28 x 6 µm; 'ascochytoid' as in sect. Heterospora: Boerema et al., 1997), which may
be produced in large quantities (up to 6356) at low temperatures, i.e. under winter
conditions (Róssner, 1968). At low temperatures the type variety usually only produces
the smaller aseptate conidia. These differences in conidial dimensions and septation
at low temperature arc also associated with differences in pathogenicity (see below).#Description*]

the capillitium being ‘trichioid’ in 7: sordida var. sordida and ‘hemitrichioid’ in
T. sordida var. sordidoides. We did not observe intermediate capillitia between the
two varieties. Hence we prefer to maintain the two varieties and do not follow the

[@Bolbitius coprophilus is a species growing on dung, compost and decaying plant
material, characterized by its pale pink pileus, at least when young and fresh. The collec-
tions from the Netherlands differ from B. titubans, B. lacteus and B. demangei not only
in colour of the basidiocarps, but also in larger spores, measuring 11.5—16.0(-16.5) x

sub lente hispidum. Hyphae agglutinatae, plus minusve indistinctae, hyalinae. Cystidia
conica, basi multi-radicosa, tunicis crassis. Basidia ± clavati-pedunculata vel cylindricipedunculata, basi attenuata (podobasidia), ± singula formata. Sporae non coloratae”.#Description*]
[@	 Some years later, Hjortstam et al. (1988) characterized this genus by “fruitbodies
resupinate, effuse, closely adnate, almost smooth but strongly hispid by protruding
cystidia, hyphal system monomitic, all hyphae clamped, cystidia numerous, robust
and mostly multi-rooted, thick-walled throughout, strongly encrusted and covered with
coralliform hyphae, basidia clavate, more or less pedunculate, thin-walled, as a rule
with four stout sterigmata, spores smooth, thin-walled, inamyloid, indextrinoid and
without cyanophilous reaction”. These authors emphasize the presence of “cystidia
covered with coralliform hyphae”, which are not present in the closely related genera
Litschauerella Oberw. and Tubulicrinis Donk. Subsequently, Kirk et al. (2001) placed
Tubulicium in the family Tubulicrinaceae Jülich within the order Polyporales Gäum.,

[@	 Ce champignon à chapeau squamuleux, décrit du Venezuela, est présenté par Patouillard & Gaillard (1888) comme une miniature de C. fenzlii, dont il partage la couleur du
chapeau et du stipe. Beardslee (1934), qui pense l’avoir retrouvé en Floride, le rapproche
également de C. fenzlii. L’habitat sabulicole, et la taille très petite (chapeau de 1,5–2
cm et stipe large de 2 mm), ainsi que sa répartition tropicale, l’éloignent de C. fenzlii
et le rapprochent du suivant. Les caractères microscopiques restent à préciser.#Description*]
[@	 Ce petit Chamaeota de Martinique, connu par sa seule récolte-type, à chapeau large
de 2 cm, stipe large de 2–3 mm et marge cannelée présente une allure de Leucocoprinus,
et n’est pas sans rappeler la description de C. xanthogramma. Pegler (1983) décrit un
revêtement piléique « en épithélium collapsé, d’articles isodiamétriques à paroi mince,
× 8–15 µm » 5, structure à ce jour inconnue chez les Pluteaceae, mais il lui donne par
ailleurs un aspect macroscopique « à petites squamules furfuracées » 6, ce qui est en
contradiction avec une telle structure. Il est plus probable qu’il s’agisse d’un revêtement trichodermique collapsé, ainsi que nous l’avons observé sur une récolte âgée de
C. fenzlii. L’absence de pleurocystides est une différence notable avec les suivants.
2. Espèces tempérées#Description*]
[@	 Singer (1929) décrit du Caucase un Annularia qu’il n’ose pas identiﬁer à C. fenzlii,
en raison de la forme du chapeau (à mamelon aigu) et de son revêtement squamuleux.
Bien plus tard, Singer (1979) assimile cette récolte (non conservée) à celle transmise
par F. Kotlaba de Tchécoslovaquie, qu’il identiﬁe ﬁnalement à C. fenzlii, avec raison
mais sans justiﬁcation. Ses deux descriptions correspondent en tout point à nos récoltes pyrénéennes. Singer (1979) signale également la pigmentation jaune de l’arête
des lames, la présence d’excroissances semiorbiculaires sur le revêtement caulinaire,
ainsi que les flocons fuligineux au disque sur fond jaune (sur matériel sec) que nous
avons observé sur l’exsiccatum le plus développé de nos récoltes (alors qu’ils n’était
pas visibles sur le frais). Les différences à noter par rapport à nos échantillons sont les
suivantes: nos spores sont un peu plus courtes (6,0–7,5 × 4,2–5,5 µm chez Singer, loc.
cit.), et, aucun diverticule n’est signalé dans les articles du revêtement piléique; mais,
d’après nos observations, ils peuvent être très discrets selon le basidiome et l’endroit
du prélèvement. Nous avons volontairement illustré sur notre planche une partie du
revêtement à diverticules particulièrement remarquables. Il est possible que Singer ne
les ait pas remarqués.#Description*]
[@	 Longyear (1902), repris par Saccardo (1925) et Kauffman (1918), décrit de Greenville (Michigan, États-Unis) un petit Annularia lignicole à chapeau large de 1,7 cm,
à mamelon proéminent et revêtement ruguleux, blanchâtre, sauf au mamelon qui est
jaune citron et à stipe entièrement blanc, mesurant 3,5 × 0,15 cm. Il indique des cystides
(non localisées, mais correspondant manifestement à des pleurocystides d’après la révision de Kauffman (loc. cit.)), fusiformes, de 50 × 20 µm et des spores subglobuleuses
de 5,0–6,0 µm. Le matériel-type est actuellement perdu (A. Fryday, conservateur de
l’herbier MSC, comm. pers.), mais nous pensons, comme Murrill (1917) et Singer
(1986), que C. sphaerospora (ci-dessous) peut lui être synonymisé. Il se différencie de
C. fenzlii au moins par les spores un peu plus petites, les pleurocystides à col cylindrique
bien différencié, et l’anneau blanc (jaune chez C. fenzlii).#Description*]
[@	 Peck (1906) décrit du Michigan un nouveau taxon proche de C. fenzlii qu’il distingue
de ce dernier par un chapeau mamelonné, palissant à blanchâtre et un stipe (anneau
compris) entièrement blanc et ferme. Curieusement Peck ne mentionne pas C. mammillata, décrit par Longyear (1902) du même secteur géographique 4 ans auparavant. La
révision du matériel-type (isotype, MICH) nous a conﬁrmé la présence de pleurocystides
abondantes (contrairement à la description du même matériel par Kauffman, 1918), et
nous paraît microscopiquement assimilable à C. mamillata. Minnis et al. (2006), dans
un article publié très récemment, concluent aussi à la synonymie de ces deux taxons.#Description*]
[@	 Ce taxon, connu par la seule description et la planche médiocre de Cesati (1861), est
décrit et ﬁguré d’Italie comme un champignon de texture fragile, à chapeau mamelonné,
blanc strié de jaune, revêtement squamuleux au mamelon, à marge striée, à lames libres,
larges, rose intense et stipe annelé, concolore au chapeau. Le revêtement squamuleux
rappelle nos récoltes, mais sa couleur blanche à striation radiale jaune ne correspond
pas. La description originale évoque autant une Pluteaceae qu’un membre du genre
Leucocoprinus. Aucun matériel-type n’a pu être localisé (Horak, 1968; Singer, 1986),
qui seul pourrait permettre d’interpréter précisément ce taxon, d’une grande importance
puisqu’il s’agit du type du genre Chamaeota. Nous préférons le considérer comme
nomen dubium, ce qui revient à renoncer au genre Chamaeota lui-même.
De ces Chamaeota jaunes, c’est nettement C. fenzlii décrit par Singer (1929, 1979)
qui est le plus proche du nôtre. Sa description est bien en accord avec nos récoltes,
notamment sur la structure et l’aspect du revêtement piléique.

[@	 The agaricoid basidiocarps have an obese and striate stalk, which extends as a percurrent columella through the pileus. The subglobose pileus remains closed until maturity, when it expands to a broad, convex pileus similar to those of Agaricaceae. At
expansion, the peridium exposes the hymenophore, with its dark, crowded, wavy, free,
sometimes anastomosing lamellae; remains of the peridium frequently form a typical
double membranous annulus. Spores (statismospores) are subglobose to ovoid, smooth,
very dark, lacking a germ pore. Excellent illustrations of A. texensis are included in
Lloyd (1904c), Barnett (1943), Harding (1957), and States (1990).#Description*]
[@	 Araneosa columellata produces closed gastroid carpophores, cream-coloured to
pale ochraceous, often pyriform, with a short and somewhat bulbous stipe as properly
illustrated by Long (1941). As he noted, the stipes of A. columellata detach easily from
the spore sac; the conic basal hole left by the stipe facilitates the breaking of the fragile
peridium, thus exposing the gleba. The Sonoran collections lack a stipe and have a
highly fragmented pileus. This is also found in the type collection of the species. As the
speciﬁc epithet reflects, a conspicuous columella protrudes through the pileus. The gleba
is formed by small, easily detachable peridioles, dark grey in the herbarium specimens,
surrounding the columella. The subglobose to irregularly ovoid spores are 5  –  6  (–7) ×
4   –  5(–  6) µm in diameter, pedicellate, reddish brown, smooth both under LM and SEM,
and without capillitium.#Description*]
[@	 The Sonoran specimens are subglobose, approximately 50 × 70  –  80 mm. The dry exo­
peridium looks like a thin, fragile copper-coloured crust attached to the endoperidium,
which appears membranous and flexible, and is cream to pale ochre. Noticeable colour
variations of the exoperidium in some specimens are the origin of the speciﬁc epithet,
as pointed out by Bottomley (1948). The lack of subgleba and mycelial strands, and the
presence of the brown, cotton like, compact and persistent gleba (referring to the name
Lanopila), characterizes this species. The capillitium is abundant, dark, extensively
interwoven, c. 4 µm in diameter, somewhat branched, septate, not pitted. The spores
are yellow brownish, 5  –  6 µm in diameter, strongly ornamented, with SEM showing
almost cylindrical processes with rounded to almost planar tips, which sometimes form
small groups.#Description*]
[@	 The Sonoran specimens of D. hyalothrix have basidiocarps up to 20 mm in diameter.
This species is characterized by ochraceous spores of a variable size (8.5  –13 µm in
diameter), with conspicuous ornamentation formed by spines fused at the apex, forming
processes with a flat tip. The spores maintain pedicels not as often as in the collections
studied by Moreno et al. (2003), with a length of 5 µm, which in some cases reaches up
to 12 µm. We believe that it is the grade of maturity and conservation of the gleba that
determines such a condition, and that the spore ornamentation is much more important
for the characterization of the species.#Description*]
[@	 This taxon is frequently observed in the xerophilous areas of Sonora. It produces
solitary to scattered, small basidiocarps (10  –13 mm in diameter in our collections),
resembling an immature Bovista. Endoptychum arizonicum is characterized by a
membranous, rather thin, smooth, yellowish exoperidium, fragile when dry; the stipe
is very short or practically absent, continued by a not fully developed columella; the
gleba is sublamellar, consisting of closely anastomosed, thin, yellowish tramal plates;
the spores are smooth, thick walled, subhyaline, globose, 7–12 µm in diameter, with a
short pedicel, and germ pore absent. The presence of clamp-connections in this species
(specially in the columella), pointed out only by Vellinga et al. (2003) was conﬁrmed.#Description*]

[@	 Pseudobaeospora calcarea belongs to the informal group Albidula as deﬁned by Bas
(2003): “Basidiocarp white to pale buff. Clamp-connections present. Cheilocystidia
absent. Pileipellis not hymenidermoid”. The species so far published in this group are
P. albidula (lacking a suprapellis, pileipellis more regular, different ecology), P. paulochroma (turning yellow in KOH, more regular structure of the pileipellis composed of
hyphae, weakly metachromatic spore walls), and P. bavariae (orange-yellow ‘rhizoids’
at the stipe base, metachromatic spore walls, regular pileipellis made from hyphae, pale
sordid yellow in KOH). They differ from P. calcarea mainly in the characters indicated
in parenthesis. The key characters of P. calcarea are the lack of yellow discoloration
with KOH, the non-staining spore walls in toluidine blue, the highly irregular structure of the pileipellis, the very acrid taste (unknown for the other species of the group
Albidula), and the occurrence on mosses.#Description*]
