Abstract —Species in the orders Glomerales and Diversisporales (Glomeromycetes) with 
glomoid spore formation are reorganized based on combined ribosomal sequence and 
morphological analyses. Within the Glomerales two genera in the Glomeraceae (Septoglomus, 
Simiglomus) and one genus in the Claroideoglomeraceae (Viscospora) are proposed as new. 
Paraglomerales species (thus far monogeneric) also form glomoid spores that may all germinate 
directly through the spore wall instead through subtending hyphae as in Glomerales. 
Key words — Glomus group A, Glomus group B, molecular phylogeny, rDNA 
Introduction
Molecular biological studies have dramatically improved the understanding 
of phylogenetic relationships across a broad swathe of organisms. Arbuscular 
mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are no exception, as molecular analyses have expanded 
our knowledge of this group (e.g. Simon et al. 1992, Redecker et al. 2000a, b, 
Morton & Redecker 2001, Schwarzott et al. 2001, Schüßler et al. 2001, Souza et 
al. 2005, Palenzuela et al. 2008, 2010). This has led to taxonomic re-organization 
and the description of several new genera and families (e.g. Morton & Redecker 
2001, Walker et al. 2007, Oehl et al. 2008). Schüßler et al. (2001) established 
the phylum Glomeromycota with four orders (Archaeosporales, Diversisporales, 
Glomerales, Paraglomerales) within one class (Glomeromycetes) described 
earlier by Cavalier-Smith (1998).
76 ... Oehl & al.
Within the Glomeromycota, species with glomoid spore formation represent 
the largest group. These species had previously been included within the 
Glomeraceae (Pirozynski & Dalpé 1989) of the suborder Glomerineae of the 
Glomerales (Morton & Benny 1990). However, after this large group of Glomus 
species was found to be polyphyletic (e.g. Redecker et al. 2000b, Schwarzott et al. 
2001), several glomoid spore-forming species were separated from the Glomerales 
sensu Morton & Benny. Based on DNA sequence analyses, Gl. occultum was 
declared type species of the new genus Paraglomus (Paraglomeraceae; Morton & 
Redecker 2001) in the new order Paraglomerales (Schüßler et al. 2001). Glomus 
spurcum was moved as type species to a new genus Diversispora (Walker & 
Schüßler 2004) in the Diversisporaceae (Diversisporales) (Schüßler et al. 2001). 
More recently Oehl & Sieverding (2004) established Pacispora (Pacisporaceae, 
Walker & Schüßler 2004) with Glomus scintillans S.L. Rose & Trappe (Rose 
& Trappe 1980) as type species for all glomoid species possessing two spore 
walls and specific germination characteristics. Moreover, some glomoid species 
were recently transferred into the Ambisporaceae of the Archaeosporales (e.g. 
Gl. callosum, Gl. fecundisporum, Gl. leptotichum; Walker et al. 2007, Walker 
2008). However, the remaining large group of Glomus spp. is considered 
particularly difficult to differentiate morphologically (Morton & Redecker 
2001, Schwarzott et al. 2001, Walker & Schüßler 2004). 
Phylogenetic reconstructions within AM fungi over the last 10 years indicate 
that this large group of Glomus species likely originated from a single ancestor, 
from which (according to Schwarzott et al. 2001) descend the Glomus groups 
Aa (related to Gl. mosseae and Gl. geosporum), Ab (related to Gl. intraradices 
and Gl. irregulare), Ac (related to Glomus sp. W3347, now Gl. hoi; see Daniell 
et al. 2001, Öpik et al. 2006), and B (related to Gl. etunicatum). Schüßler et 
al. (2001) also showed that the clades of groups Aa, Ab and B divide further. 
Adapting and slightly modifying the numbering system of Schwarzott et al. 
(2001), we differentiate the clades into group Aa1 (lead sp. Gl. mosseae), Aa2 
(lead sp. Gl. hoi), Aa3 (lead sp. Gl. constrictum), Ab1 (lead spp. Gl. microcarpum, 
Gl. macrocarpum), Ab2 (lead spp. Gl. intraradices, Gl. irregulare, Gl. aggregatum), 
Ab3 (lead spp. Gl. sinuosum, Gl. coremioides), B1 (lead sp. Gl. etunicatum), and B2 
(lead sp. Gl. viscosum). In the present study, “lead species” are those with typical 
morphological characters and not necessarily type species. Under “Results & 
discussion” we present the supporting phylogenetic clades and detail the major 
morphological spore characteristics for each of our groups — Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, 
Ab1, Ab2, Ab3, B1, B2. In those cases where morphological and molecular data 
are congruent, species of the same group and number can be classified together 
at the genus level (e.g., group Aa1 represents one genus, while Aa2 represents 
another genus), while the major groups A and B are suggested to be family 
levels. In the case of clades Ab1, Ab2, Ab3, however, the molecular database 
Glomoid species reorganized ... 77
remains under-represented with regard to the known species and the results 
are contradictory, as some sequences are derived from species that have been 
only poorly characterized. Although the morphological data indicate a division 
of Ab into at least three subgroups (genera), we currently lack sufficient genetic 
data to support new genera. Thus, clades Ab1, Ab2, Ab3 will be considered in 
one single genus (group Ab) at this time. 
Previous phylogenetic analyses indicated that several Glomus spp. (e.g. 
Gl. versiforme) belong to clade ‘Glomus group’ ‘C’ (e.g. Schwarzott et al. 
2001, Schüßler et al. 2001, Redecker et al. 2007), currently Diversispora 
(Diversisporaceae). Only six glomoid spore-forming species have so far been 
included in this genus (Walker & Schüßler 2004, Gamper et al. 2009, Schüßler 
& Walker 2010). The morphology of Diversispora spores differs, however, from 
spores of groups A and B. We call this group of species “group Ca” and will 
transfer them to the genus Diversispora. 
Recently, Redecker et al. (2007) identified another Glomus group (including 
Gl. fulvum and Gl. pulvinatum) that was genetically related to group C 
but phylogenetically and morphologically clearly distinct from group Ca 
(Diversispora). The authors did not separate this group from the other 
species of group C (Diversispora), possibly due to lack of recognition of the 
morphologically distinct features of spores. Recently, Schüßler & Walker 
(2010) erected the genus Redeckera (“group Cb”) with three species (Gl. fulvum, 
Gl. megalocarpum, and Gl. pulvinatum) within the Diversisporaceae.
When Schüßler et al. (2001) proposed a new phylum for the AM fungi, 
although they initiated a principal re-organization of species with the four 
orders, they did not propose families and genera that were clearly separated 
genetically from each other. For example, Diversisporales and Diversisporaceae, 
lacking either type genus or type species, were at that time invalidly described, 
while the same authors mentioned only that some Glomus groups in the 
Glomerales and Glomeraceae were clearly genetically different. This had the 
unfortunate result that other taxonomists or ecological mycorrhizologists 
continued to refer to Glomus group A, group B, and ‘the like’ as Schüßler et al. 
(2001) had called them. Even new taxa were being justified on the basis of small 
differences in partial rDNA sequences within such Glomus groups as A, B or 
C (e.g. Błaszkowski et al. 2004, 2006, 2008, Oehl et al. 2005). Furthermore, in a 
recent study (Gamper et al. 2009) species of Glomus, Diversispora and others, 
e.g. Glomus versiforme and D. celata, were shown to be phylogenetically strongly 
related, although no attempts were made to reorganize Gl. versiforme and related 
‘Glomus’ spp. into Diversispora. In ecological studies, so-called ‘environmental 
sequences’ (DNA sequences from AM species as yet unrecorded in databases, 
often directly recovered from mycorrhizal root or soil analyses instead of from 
identified spores) are named and referred to as ‘Glomus sp. uncultured’ or 
78 ... Oehl & al.
‘Glomus unknown,’ not particularly helpful to someone who wishes to know 
whether the species so named represents Diversispora, Glomus group A or B 
sensu Schüßler et al., or a different group that might have completely different 
spore formation. 
It is clear that an improved phylogeny of Glomus is urgently needed (see 
also Krüger et al. 2009, Stockinger et al. 2009). Currently, new or unknown 
species that are related to ‘groups of genetically related fungi’ but belong to 
clearly distinct phylogenetic groups continue to be called ‘Glomus’ and thus 
remain incorrectly classified. One motivation for this paper was the feeling that 
because Gl. versiforme has been supported as belonging to Diversispora, it should 
officially be included within that genus. From that it followed that if group 
A could phylogenetically be separated from groups B and C (Diversispora), 
a new organization of the known and described species is both justified and 
necessary. A first attempt was tried only recently by Schüßler & Walker (2010); 
however, these authors based their conclusions almost exclusively on molecular 
analyses and did not correlate their phylogenetic results with the morphological 
characters of the different phylogenetic clades that our analyses indicate.
The objectives of the present study were therefore to: 1) identify and describe 
morphological differences or similarities of species in the various ‘Glomus 
groups,’ and 2) reorganize the species into existing or new genera as accurately 
as possible according to currently available information. Thus, we aim here 
at re-organizing the AM fungal species with glomoid spore formation using 
existing genetic information combined with existing or new morphological 
spore characteristics within the Glomerales and Diversisporales.
Material & methods
Specimen analyses
We analyzed specimens representing 101 of a total 117 described Glomus and 
Diversispora spp. (table 1). Holotype, isotype, paratype and ex-type materials were 
examined along with representatives from institutional herbaria — OSC, FH, Z+ZT, 
URM (Recife, Brazil), Embrapa Agrobiologia (Seropédica, Brazil), DCS-UFLA (Lavras, 
Brazil), International Culture Collection of Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi 
(INVAM), Swiss collection of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (SAF, Agroscope ART 
Zurich) — and private AM fungal collections curated by Sieverding, Oehl, Trappe, 
Błaszkowski, McGee, and Goto. The Hall & Abbott (1979) photographic slide collection 
was also reviewed. For this paper, all original species descriptions and published species 
emendations were also considered. 
Older specimens (mounted on microscopic slides prior to 1990) were mostly 
mounted in lactophenol, while others were fixed with polyvinyl alcohol-lactic acidglycerol (PVLG) or in a mixture of PVLG + Melzer’s reagent, which post-1990 are the 
principal fixing media (Brundrett et al. 1994). Newly mounted spores and sporocarps 
from collections or from cultures were fixed using the latter two fixing media, or 
occasionally also in a mixture of 1:1 lactic acid to water, in Melzer’s reagent, and in water.

When available, spores freshly isolated from soils or bait cultures were also mounted 
and analyzed. Spore wall terminology follows the nomenclature of Walker (1983) and 
Stürmer & Morton (1997). Analyses of the spore walls, the germination structures and 
all other mycorrhizal structures were performed using compound microscopes at 100–
1000×. Most photographs were taken with a digital camera (Olympus model DP70CU) mounted on a Zeiss Axioplan compound microscope, although a few were taken at 
OSC, URM or INVAM during short-term visits. Legends and scales were inserted with 
Adobe Photoshop CS2 9.0.
All spore observations and all information on spore characteristics are based on 
spores extracted from soil, from trap cultures or from single or multiple spore-derived 
pure cultures. No information is provided from in-vitro-cultured materials.
Molecular and phylogenetic analyses 
Genes analyzed: Partial sequences of β-tubulin and rRNA (SSU and LSU) genes 
were used to reconstruct, by independent analyses, the phylogeny of the Glomeromycota. 
Intron sequences from the β-tubulin gene were excluded and only exon regions were 
considered within analyses. ITS sequences were also used to clarify relationships among 
members of the Diversisporales. 
Sequence alignment: The sequences (all obtained from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information-NCBI) were aligned using the program ClustalX (Larkin et 
al. 2007) and edited with the BioEdit program (Hall 1999) to obtain a final alignment.

Phylogenetic analyses: The main tree was constructed by a heuristic search 
using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the Phylogenetic Analysis Using 
Parsimony (PAUP) program version 4 (Swofford 2003). Maximum parsimony (MP) and 
neighbor joining (NJ) analyses with 1000 bootstrap replications also were performed 
by PAUP. Bayesian (two runs over 1 x 106 generations with a burnin value of 2500) and 
maximum likelihood (1000 bootstrap) analyses were executed, respectively, in MrBayes 
3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) and PhyML (Guindon & Gascuel 2003), launched 
from Topali 2.5. The model of nucleotide substitution was estimated using Topali 2.5 
(Milne et al. 2004). Sequences from Neurospora crassa, Boletus edulis, Rhizophydium 
sphaerotheca were used as outgroups for Glomeromycota, and Glomus intraradices and 
G. xanthium for Diversisporales (ITS analysis).

Results & discussion
Relationships between general phylogenetics and morphological features
All four orders of the Glomeromycota have species that form glomoid spores. 
Paraglomerales and Archaeosporales have low phylogenetic relationship with 
Glomerales and Diversisporales (e.g. Redecker et al. 2007, Palenzuela et al. 2008; 
Figs. 1–2, 4). Representatives of Ambispora, Archaeospora, Intraspora, and 
Paraglomus form extraradical mycelia and mycorrhizal structures that stain 
faintly to not at all in trypan blue (Spain & Miranda 1996, Spain 2003, Spain 
et al. 2006, Sieverding & Oehl 2006). (The reasons for this are unclear: vesicle 
formation is rarely reported or might have been misinterpreted in Archaeospora, 
Intraspora and Paraglomus.) This differs from the current glomeralean and 
diversisporalean species, which have fungal structures that stain blue to deep

blue with trypan blue. They are also reported to form vesicular arbuscular 
mycorrhiza (Schüßler et al. 2001), except for Gigasporaceae, Scutellosporaceae, 
Racocetraceae and Dentiscutataceae, which form arbuscular mycorrhiza but not 
intraradical vesicles, or at least vesicles have never been observed (Bentivenga & 
Morton 1995, Oehl et al. 2008). To date Paraglomerales species are monogeneric 
and form glomoid spores that may all germinate directly through the spore wall 
instead of through the subtending hyphae as in Glomus and Diversispora (Spain 
and Miranda 1996; Oehl pers. obs. on P. occultum).

and Gl. constrictum as lead species of Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3, respectively. Further 
separation of clade Ab is not clear, although former Sclerocystis spp. (group Ab3) 
and Gl. badium (morphologically also in group Ab3) are monophyletic (Fig. 1). 
Clades Ab1 and Ab2, which differ consistently in glomoid spore morphology 
(see below) and contain the largest number of species, were not re-organized 
because the genetic database is not yet complete. Of the species analyzed, only 
Gl. aureum represents clade Ab1, which should have Gl. macrocarpum as type 
species according to Clements & Shear (1931). However, the 18S rDNA region 
(Fig. 1) does not provide sufficient support by itself for creating a new genus. 
The two lead species of group Ab2 are Gl. intraradices and Gl. irregulare, but 
this group also is not yet recognized at the genus level. The group B clade 
clearly stands apart from the others and splits into Glomus groups B1 and B2. 
Glomus viscosum is hereafter attributed as a single species to group B2, while 
Gl. etunicatum was recognized as the lead species for the group B1 (Fig. 1). 
The ITS regions from clade groups Ca and Cb were analyzed because other 
sequence data were either unavailable for group Cb species or (for the 18S) 
available only for the lead species, Gl. fulvum. ITS analyses showed the Ca and 
Cb clades well separated from each other (Fig. 3). 
Morphology of glomoid, diversisporoid, and pacisporoid spores 
All glomoid spores of the present Glomeraceae and Diversisporaceae have 
one single spore wall with several layers. In many species the structural wall 
layer is the inner layer, although other species possess additional innermost 
(semi-)flexible layers. Because these additional layers are generally thin (often 
<1µm), closely adhere to the structural layer, and can be separated from the 
latter only through hard pressure on the cover slides, they are not considered 
separate walls. The presence or absence of innermost flexible layers is not 
sufficient to distinguish morphologically between Glomus groups since the 
majority of groups have some species with and some species without innermost 
flexible layers. Such characters as mycelial/ mycorrhizal infection features, spore 
size, spore wall color, wall ornamentation, and layer numbers or their staining 
features could rarely be attributed to all species within a specific clade. 
Spores of groups A and B have a structural layer that forms a continuum 
from attached hyphal to spore wall layers (Figs. 5–17). We refer to such spore 
types as glomoid. 
Because Ca and Cb group spores have a structural layer that appears to 
be inserted into the wall of the terminal element of the attached hypha, the 
Glomoid species reorganized ... 87

structural spore wall layers may not form a continuum with the hyphal wall 
layers (Figs. 18–21). The inner wall layer appears to differentiate de novo, 
similar (but not equal) to inner walls in Acaulosporaceae or Entrophosporaceae 
88 ... Oehl & al.

(Oehl et al. 2006, Sieverding & Oehl 2006). In Ca the structural and (if present) 
inner flexible spore wall layers form a septum at the base or at a short distance 
from the base of the spore within the subtending hypha. In Cb the inner lamina 
of the structural wall layer always forms a septum at the spore base and the 
outer lamina may continue for 1–10 µm into the subtending hypha. We refer to 
this spore type as diversisporoid.
Glomoid species reorganized ... 89
Pacispora spores superficially resemble glomoid spores, as the spore wall 
structural layer forms a continuum with the hyphal wall layers. However, 
Pacispora spores strongly differ from glomoid spores: i) in possessing an 
additional thick inner germinal wall that forms de novo and is clearly separate 
from the outer wall; ii) by species-specific germination structures resembling 
a germ shield; and iii) by germ tubes that arise from the ‘shields’ on the inner 
wall and penetrate directly the adjacent outer wall. We refer to this spore type 
as pacisporoid.
Morphology of the subtending hypha, spore base, and spore pore closure 
A combination of two major morphological features and one secondary 
feature are congruent with the major molecular phylogenetic groups of the 
glomoid, diversisporoid, and pacisporoid species (Table 2): i) the morphology 
of the spore base including the pore closure and position of the septum 
(Figs. 5–23, 24–114); ii) the morphology of the subtending hypha (sh) 
(Figs. 5–23, 24–114); and iii) secondarily, the prevailing formation and spore 
organization level within either sporocarps or spore clusters or singly in soil.
Spores of Glomus groups Aa(1,2,3) and Ab(1,2,3) all have sh that are 
concolorous with (or slightly lighter in color than) the structural spore wall, 
and the spore wall differentiation extends completely into the sh (table 2, 
Figs. 5–14, 24–89). In group B1 and B2 spores the structural spore wall 
differentiation also extends into the sh, but the sh colour changes abruptly to 
hyaline or white at the spore base, even when the spore wall layers are distinctly 
pigmented (table 2, Figs. 15–17, 90–98).

Figs 5–17. Examples of spore bases (with 1–3 spore wall layers; swl1–3) and subtending hyphae 
(sh) of species assigned to phylogenetic clades Aa1, Aa2, Aa3, Ab1, Ab2, Ab3, B1 and B2; structural 
spore wall layers are continuous with the sh wall. 5–14. sh of A clade spores are concolorous 
with or slightly lighter than the spore wall. 5–8. Clade Aa species never have an introverted wall 
thickening at the base; spore pores are generally closed by a conspicuous septum (sp) arising 
In contrast, the spore wall differentiation generally does not extend into the 
sh in group Ca and Cb spores (table 2, Figs. 14–19, 99–114), as lamination 
and differentiation of the structural spore wall layer either does not extend into 
the sh or extends only a short distance from the base. Within these Ca and Cb, 
therefore, the sh are usually quite fragile (Figs. 99–107) and hyaline to white, 
distal to the pore closure at the spore base (Gl. spurcum = Di. spurca) or in the 
sh (Gl. eburneum). The hyaline to white color of the sh behind the septum 
changes conspicuously when spores are pigmented. Cb species have broad 
sh and broad septa at the spore bases (Figs. 108–114). Their sh are inflated 
(Gl. pulvinatum) or (sometimes) very short within compact sporocarps (e.g. 
Gl. fulvum and Gl. canadense).
Type of spore formation 
Glomus group spore formation is intercalary or terminal on sh, both for 
spores formed either singly in soil (e.g. Gl. arborense, Gl. etunicatum) or in 
loose/dense spore clusters or sporocarps (e.g. Gl. fasciculatum, Gl. pallidum, 
Gl. glomerulatum).

Figs 18–23. Clades Ca (Diversispora) and Cb (Redeckera) spore bases (with 1–3 spore wall layers; 
swl1–3) and subtending hyphae (sh): structural spore wall layer seemingly extends only a very 
short distance into the subtending hyphae, soon becoming hyaline to white and undetectable; often 
only the adherent outer spore wall layer(s) appears continuous with the mycelial hyphal wall to 
connect the two neighboring spores in compact sporocarps. The structural layer often appears 
inserted into the ‘swollen hyphal tips’. 18–22. Ca: spore sh generally white and cylindrical at the 
spore base, soon fragile. Septum (sp) arises from the structural spore wall layer and either closes 
the pore immediately or at some distance from the spore base (18–21) or the spore pore appears 
open (22). 23. Cb: spore sh generally inflated a very short distance from the spore base with the 
structural layer extending an equally short distance in the subtending hypha. At base, spores are 
‘endospore-like,’ with a broad, thick septum formed by the structural layer. 
Aa1 species generally form spores singly (e.g. Gl. geosporum, Gl. caledonium) 
or occasionally in sporocarps containing just a few (2–20) spores (e.g. Gl. 
mosseae, Gl. monosporum, Gl. coronatum). Aa2 and Aa3 species form spores 
preferably singly in soil or roots, or in very loose spore clusters (Gl. hoi, 
Gl. constrictum, Gl. deserticola, Gl. xanthium). Ab1 and Ab2 species generally 
form spores in multi-spored loose/dense variably sized spore clusters. During 
initial spore formation they may also form spores singly, although some isolates 
appear never to form clusters in single species cultures on certain hosts. Ab3 
species form spores strictly in sporocarps but may initially form single spores 
on their mycelia (Gl. sinuosum). 
Glomoid species reorganized ... 93
B1 species generally form spores either singly in soil (e.g. Gl. etunicatum, 
Gl. claroideum, Gl. walkeri) or in variably sized loose spore clusters (Gl. viscosum). 
Sporocarp formation is extremely rare, if ever. The solitary B2 species — 
Gl. viscosum — forms spores in clusters of highly variable size. Ca species form 
spores singly in soils (e.g. Gl. spurcum = Di. spurca; Gl. eburneum) or in small 
to large and irregular shaped compacted clusters with numerous spores (e.g. 
Gl. versiforme, Gl. epigaeum) depending on culture and site conditions. Finally, 
Cb species generally form spores in large, compact sporocarps (e.g. Gl. fulvum, 
Gl. fragile) that are among the largest known within the Glomeromycota 
(especially Gl. megalocarpum). As the formation of a peridium around the 
sporocarps or single spores does occur in groups Aa1, Ab1, Ab3, and Cb, it is 
not a consistent morphological indicator at the family or genus level. Peridium 
formation has not yet been observed for B1, B2, and Ca species.
Organization level of sporocarps
Except for group Ab3, spores of other Glomus groups have (with some 
exceptions) limited to no organization in sporocarps or compacted spore 
clusters. As spores in sporocarps appear to be randomly distributed, sh are 
variably long (e.g. Gl. mosseae, Gl. coronatum, Gl. macrocarpum, Gl. ambisporum, 
Gl. versiforme, Gl. fulvum, Gl. pulvinatum). In contrast, Ab3 sporocarps are 
highly organized with spores forming around a central hyphal plexus. Variation 
in sh length is much lower (e.g. Gl. sinuosum, Gl. rubiforme). Sporocarp size 
variability of Ab3 species is low, largely dependent on the diameter of the central 
hyphal plexus and spore size in individual species. In unorganized sporocarps 
of the other ‘Glomus groups’ sporocarp size is much more variable due to a lack 
of symmetry, greater sh length variability, and greater variability of numbers 
of spores formed per sporocarp. According to our analyses, species that 
form dense, highly compact sporocarps (e.g., Gl. radiatum, Gl. vesiculiferum, 
Gl. segmentatum, Gl. convolutum, Gl. fuegianum) do not form spores around a 
central hyphal plexus arising from a single hypha but sporocarps appear to have 
several hyphal attachments. They thus probably belong to group Ab1 and so are 
not attributed to group Ab3.

Figs 24–46. Glomus clade Ab1 forms spores in unorganized clusters/sporocarps or (sometimes) 
singly in soil; subtending hyphae (sh) are concolorous with (or slightly lighter than) the spore 
wall, normally with introverted, species-specific basal wall thickenings; sh often cylindrical 
(very short if formed in compact sporocarps). Species-specific sh wall thickening may continue 
over rather long distances (≤ 200–500 µm) even in sporocarps. Spores with 1–4 wall layers

Figs. 75–84
Emended Description: Spores formed within soil or rarely roots, singly or 
sometimes in sporocarps with a few to several spores per sporocarp only; the 
conspicuous sh is concolorous with spore wall color (or slightly lighter in 
color), sh is species-specific and generally funnel-shaped to cylindrical. Wall 
differentiation and pigmentation may continue over long distances from the 
spore base (often > 50–250 µm), then mycelium may become hyaline. Pore 
regularly closed by a conspicuous septum that species-specifically arises from 
the structural wall layer, from an additional adherent innermost, (semi-)flexible 
lamina, or from both but not by introverted wall thickening, which is lacking. 
Forming typical vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza, with mycorrhizal structures 
that stain blue to dark blue in trypan blue. 
Gender: Funneliformis is a compound Latin adjective with a masculine/
feminine termination. Although under ICBN [Vienna Code] Article 62.3, the 
authors had the prerogative to choose either of these genders, their actual choice 
102 ... Oehl & al.
of neuter gender was not an available option. We therefore choose to treat this 
genus as masculine (Article 62.3) and have made the appropriate corrections to 
all adjectival epithets.

Taxonomic problems 
We were unsure whether we had attributed Gl. dolichosporum and 
Gl. citricola to the correct genus, as the available descriptions were either short 
or in Chinese, images were missing or relatively poor, or the type specimen 
was not accessible. Moreover, in several species descriptions (some even very 
recent), the focus on the spore base and sh features was minimal to absent. For 
such cases, we decided to retain these species within Glomus, pending future 
revision. Placement of Gl. pubescens was similarly difficult: Already transferred 
to four different genera other than its basionym genus, this particular species 
may not even represent an AM fungus (e.g. Trappe, pers. comm.). Of all clades 
discussed here and fungal genera known, this species appears to fit best in 
Glomus group Ab1.
During our spore analyses, it was apparent that several genetic groups 
(clades) possess species with spores so similar that either the species are 
difficult to differentiate morphologically or may be conspecific. Examples 
include Aa3—Se. deserticola, Se. xanthium; Ab2—Gl. clarum, Gl. manihotis, 
Gl. zaozhuangianum; and Ca—Di. versiformis, Di. przelewicensis, Di. epigaea. 
As it was beyond the scope of this study to clarify all vagaries and possible 
taxonomic uncertainties at the species level, we have placed them into genera 
based on morphological characteristics, especially as many type specimens 
were unavailable (see table 1). In some cases confusion may have resulted 
from misidentification or incorrect re-naming prior to genetic analysis. For 
example, the Gl. clarum isolate BR147B (supplied by Bioplanta) that grouped 
with Gl. manihotis in the initial phylogenetic study by Schüßler et al. (2001) 
was an ex-type of Gl. manihotis when sent in 1987 to Bioplanta (Sieverding 
pers. com.) but which some time later was relabeled as Gl. clarum by someone 
else. Not surprisingly, this particular ‘Gl. clarum’ isolate grouped with other 
Gl. manihotis ex-type material in the study by Schüßler et al. (2001). 
Consequently, genetic information provided for some species as well as the 
conclusion that other species are conspecific may be based on erroneous 
information. 
Until recently, both germination and germination structures were regarded 
as important features to distinguish between AM fungal genera and families 
(e.g., Pacisporaceae vs. Glomeraceae by Oehl & Sieverding 2004, Walker & 
Schüßler 2004; among Gigasporaceae, Scutellosporaceae, Racocetraceae, and 
Dentiscutataceae by Oehl et al. 2008, 2011a; and Archaeospora vs. Ambispora by 
Spain et al. 2006). There are clear indications that Paraglomus species germinate 
directly through the spore wall as observed for Pa. occultum, Pa. brasilianum 
and Pa. lacteum (Spain & Miranda 1996, Rose & Trappe 1980, Oehl pers. obs.) 
in contrast to all other species forming single-walled glomoid or diversisporoid 
spores where a germ tube emerges apparently through the sh (e.g. Glomus, 
114 ... Oehl & al.
Diversispora). There are uncertainties surrounding germ tube formation in some 
Glomus spp., such as Gl. pallidum, which Hall (1977) reported as germinating 
directly through the spore wall, although his description and photos suggest 
instead either intercalary spore formation or two hyphal attachments on the 
same spore. Intercalary spore formation (= two attachments) is a frequent 
feature for many Glomus sporocarpic (Ab) species.
Molecular difficulties
The major problem encountered during the current study revolved around 
the limited molecular database, especially for species of the former Glomus 
groups Ab1, Ab3, and Cb. Moreover, only a limited number of Glomeromycota 
species in the public databases have been sequenced for all currently available 
markers (LSU rDNA, SSU rDNA, ITS region, β-tubulin). Some individual 
clades were supported in just one dataset. Another major difficulty was that 
either many cultures of glomoid or diversisporoid spore-forming species are 
lost or yet to be cultured successfully in single species cultures or the species 
were not culturable. This renders analyses difficult or impossible. During the 
study, DNA extraction was attempted from several species using field spores or 
sporocarps but they largely failed (e.g., Gl. invermaium, Gl. taiwanense). These 
obstacles have left the database incomplete and slowed progress in complete 
molecular AM fungal identification. 
Discussion
In this paper, we have revised the taxonomic organization of AM fungal 
species with glomoid spore formation, based largely on newly available molecular 
data retrieved from the literature and public databases. This organization 
is also based upon morphological spore characteristics, which were either 
already well established or newly established during this study. Phylogenetic 
trees support all genera proposed in this paper and some genera proposed by 
Walker & Schüßer (2010), with bootstrap support > 80% (except Septoglomus 
in the beta-tubulin phylogeny) in at least one analysis (NJ, ML, Bayesian or 
MP). However, Rhizophagus (Ab2) and Sclerocystis (Ab3) were not supported 
by our phylogenetic analyses and thus, the resurrection of these genera Walker 
& Schüßer (2010) cannot be accepted. The genera proposed or confirmed in 
the present study are shown as clusters in the trees: Glomus (Ab1, Ab2, Ab3), 
Funneliformis (Aa1), Simiglomus (Aa2), Septoglomus (Aa3), Claroideoglomus 
(B1), Viscospora (B2), Diversispora (Ca) and Redeckera (Cb). In Table 3, we 
summarize the new taxonomic organization of AM fungal species within the 
Glomeromycota.
There is no doubt that glomoid and diversisporoid spores in Glomeraceae, 
Claroideoglomeraceae and Diversisporaceae can clearly be differentiated by 
molecular phylogeny (Figs. 1–4), as shown earlier (Schüßler et al. 2001, Silva 
Glomoid species reorganized ... 115
et al. 2006, Stockinger et al. 2010). Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae 
differ morphologically in the hyphal attachments at the spore base and in 
spore clustering/aggregation or sporococarp formation. The phylogenetic trees 
also show Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae as separate clades with high 
bootstrap values in SSU, LSU, and beta-tubulin analyses.
Differences in hyphal connections at the spore base are also basic 
morphological indicators for other related but clearly genetically separate 
families of the Glomeromycota (e.g., Acaulosporaceae, Pacisporaceae, 
Scutellosporaceae). It has been argued earlier that unequivocal assignment 
of glomoid and diversisporoid spore-forming species to the correct major 
phylogenetic clade through morphological spore analyses alone would be

impossible (e.g. Schüßler et al. 2001, Morton & Redecker 2001, Walker et 
al. 2007), primarily because glomoid and diversisporoid spores have but few 
differentiating morphological characters (which may yet hold true). Features 
other than hyphal connections (such as spore size and color) overlap between 
many glomoid and diversisporoid species, and intraspecific variation might be 
considerable. Spore aggregation and cluster/sporocarp formation in glomoid 
and diversisporoid species are not well investigated and have thus far received 
only limited attention. However, sporocarp formation and organization may 
be stable characteristics, as found in the former genus Sclerocycstis, which at 
some point may need to be raised again to genus level within the Glomeraceae. 
Other species of Glomeraceae are also always formed in sporocarps (e.g. 
Gl. glomerulatum, Gl. formosanum) but as yet there are insufficient molecular 
data to support their placement within their own genus. Other glomoid spores 
form in clusters or sporocarps occurring in relatively small to sometimes huge 
spore numbers (Gl. macrocarpum, Gl. microcarpum, Gl. aureum) as well as 
form singly in soil or in roots, so that spore aggregation alone cannot be used 
to diagnose the taxonomic order. We acknowledge that the large genus Glomus 
currently has morphologically heterogeneous spores, and recent findings 
by Błaszkowski et al. (2009a, b) show that several clades with small-spored 
species also belong to this group. To date, there are insufficient sequence sets 
available for more detailed analyses, although new genera could result from 
such analyses. This applies also for Gl. intraradices versus Gl. macrocarpum 
and Gl. microcarpum and Glomus Ab1 species in general. Recent research 
has also shown that genetic information generated years ago may actually be 
derived from another species, Gl. irregulare (Stockinger et al. 2009). Based on 
morphology alone, species such as Gl. intraradices should be excluded from 
Glomus. 
Within Diversispora (respective former Glomus group C, our clade Ca) 
and Redeckera (our clade Cb), there has been no previous attempt to explain 
how these species differ morphologically from the former Glomeraceae 
groups A and B (Schüßler et al. 2001, Walker & Schüßler 2004). While 
morphological differentiation between Diversispora and Redeckera is possible, 
the morphology of Diversispora spores that differentiates them from spores of 
some Claroideoglomus spp. may be difficult to recognize, even for taxonomic 
specialists. 
To conclude, our paper reports on the congruence of morphological groups 
(genera and family) with molecular phylogeny that has shown the need for a 
substantial reorganization of taxa in Glomeromycota.
Unsolved obstacles in the Glomeraceae
With approximately 70 species, the revised Glomus remains morphologically 
heterogeneous and the largest genus in the Glomeromycota. Species such as 
Glomoid species reorganized ... 117
Gl. intraradices, Gl. aggregatum, and Gl. proliferum are atypical in the genus 
regarding spore base closure by wall thickening and/or septum. These are 
normally quite stable features and not highly variable within species: a septum 
not readily seen at the spore base is either species specific or indicates the spore 
development stage. Mature spores have septa more frequently formed by the 
innermost lamina of the inner spore wall layer. Morphologically speaking, 
species like Gl. intraradices, Gl. aggregatum, and Gl. proliferum should be 
included in a separate genus, but the absence of sufficient genetic information 
(in particular of the other Glomus spp.) does not support this hypothesis. 
Additionally, we include several small-spored, cluster-forming species within 
the revised Glomus (e.g. Gl. perpusillum, Gl. indicum, G. iranicum) whose spores 
quickly decompose, suggesting that some earlier may have erroneously been 
designated ‘non-sporulating AM fungi’ (Błaszkowski et al. 2009b). Verification 
is still needed to establish whether there are indeed species of ‘non-sporulating’ 
fungi within the Glomus clade.
