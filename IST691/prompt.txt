Can you extract any attributes and their measurements from the following description of an organism?

Mycelium on the substrate is medium orange-brown,
septate, 3-4 Âµm diam., often distinctly and coarsely rough;
hyphae often run parallel to the long axis of cells in
substrate tissue but usually branch on the exterior and
appear as a non-patterned network. Sporulation units are
produced as enlarging tips of short branches, at first
concolorous with surface mycelium but soon dark orange-
brown and finally black-brown and opaque. In type material
an occasional enlarging branch can be seen attached to the
hypha from which it developed; in most instances, however,
the enlarged branch elements have broken loose from the
mycelium or are so densely crowded on the substrate and so
nearly opaque that points of attachment cannot be traced
