Synoptic Key of Life
by La Monte Henry Piggy Yarroll <piggy.yarroll+skol@gmail.com>

The goal of this project is to find and understand all the species
descriptions in the biological literature, and automatically generate
a synoptic key for all the known species.

I'm starting with the Mycological (fungi) literature, as I am familiar
with it and know where to find a lot of it.

This is a project of the [Western Pennsylvania Mushroom
Club](http://wpamushroomclub.org) as a contribution to the [North
American Mycoflora Project](http://namp.org).
