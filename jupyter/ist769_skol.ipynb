    "Synoptic Key of Life (SKOL) is a web site and application that aims to provide easy access to all of the open taxonomic literature in Mycology. A synoptic key is a tool that helps you identify an organism making successive observations, building up a detailed description of the organism in front of you. There are many fine synoptic keys available for particular taxa, but they are all hand-built. SKOL uses AI to build the synoptic key automatically.\n",

    "The goal is to make it easier for advanced amateur mycologists to build technical descriptions of fungi.''\n",

    "## Storage needs\n",
    "\n",
    "SKOL uses a diverse set of databases to hold different artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original literature is ingested into the document database CouchDB (citation needed) along with available publication metadata. The originals are typically PDF files which are stored as attachments on the CouchDB ingestion records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is extracted from the ingested files, using OCR if necessary. This text is a second attachment on the ingestion record.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier is trained from hand-annotated articles and stored in Redis. The model has an expiration period of several weeks. The classifier then annotates each text document with labels for Nomenclature, Description, and Misc-exposition. It stores these annotated articles as attachments on the CouchDB ingestion records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxon names (typically species names with literature annotation) and combined with matching descriptions into Taxon records and stored in another CouchDB database. These records are the core data for SKOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taxon records are processed a number of ways: sentence embedding, JSON encoding, and artificial cladograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence embedding is done with an SBERT model (citation needed) and stored as a blob in Redis. The embedding has an expiration period of 24 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Mistral model (citation needed) converts each Taxon record description is converted into a hierarchy of features, subfeatures, and values. The epectation is that these data structures will eventually form the basis of pull-down menus in the SKOL user interface. These JSON structures are stored in another CouchDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentence embeddings are further processed into a single tree of Taxon reccords based on their distance from each other in the sentence embedding space. This tree is stored in a neo4j database.\n"

We selected type material of 16 \\nspecific and intraspecific names recently placed in Caloplaca (Teloschistaceae) \\nfor study. Authors of these names are Szatala (12), Mereschkowsky (1), \\nMagnusson (1), Servít & Nádvorník (1) and Verseghy (1). Most of the names \\n242 ... Vondrák & al.\\nare here reduced to synonymy of other names, but Caloplaca brachyspora, \\nC. flavovirescens var. persica, C. gyalolechiiformis, C. hungarica, and C. servitiana \\nrepresent well defined taxa.\\nMaterials and methods\\nThe following characters were investigated in type materials: character and \\ncolour of thalli, size and colour of apothecia, size of ascospores and width \\nof septa; spore length / width ratios and septum width / spore length ratios \\nwere calculated. Other characters (e.g. excipular structure or size of vegetative \\ndiaspores) were studied for only some of the species. The measurements are given \\nas (min.–)X±SD(–max.), where X = mean value and SD = standard deviation. \\nTotal numbers of measurements are given in brackets [n]. Photographs were \\nmade of both the collections studied and their labels; images are archived at: \\nhttp://botanika.bf.jcu.cz/lichenology/index. php?pg=5&func=cat&idx=4.\\nThe names\\nThe accepted name for each taxon is presented in bold font.\\n1.

Although Karsten (1892) reported the first records of Marasmius from \\nChina, the reported species M. dryophilus (Bull.) P. Karst. and M. butyraceus \\n(Bull.) P. Karst. are currently accepted as Gymnopus dryophilus (Bull.) Murrill \\nand Rhodocollybia butyracea (Bull.) Lennox. Teng (1963) recorded 6 species, \\nTai (1979) provided a comprehensive account of Marasmius with a list of 23 \\nChinese taxa, and only the species of Marasmius from Guangdong and Hainan \\nprovinces were studied relatively intensively (Bi et al 1985, 1993; Bi & Li 1987, \\nLi et al. 1994), although a few other records have also been reported from \\nother areas in China. During a recent critical re-examination on the specimens \\ndeposited in the Herbarium of Cryptogams, Kunming Institute of Botany of \\nthe Chinese Academy of Sciences (KUN, with HKAS numbers) and Herbarium \\nof Guangdong Institute of Microbiology (GDGM), a new species and a new \\nrecord for China were discovered. They are described and illustrated herein.\\n342 ... Deng, Li, & Song\\nMaterials & methods\\nSpecimens were annotated and photographed in the field, dried in an electric \\ndrier, and then preserved in the herbarium. Color terms and notations follow those of \\nKornerup & Wanscher (1978). Fungal tissues were mounted in 5% KOH for microscopic \\nexamination. The terms used to describe lamellae spacing refer to the number of lamellae \\nreaching from the stipe to the pileus margin, and the spacing of lamellulae is indicated \\nby the number of series present. Spore statistics include: xm, the arithmetic mean of the \\nspore length by spore width (± standard deviation) for n spores measured in a single \\nspecimen; Q, the quotient of spore length by spore width in any one spore, indicated as a \\nrange of variation in n spores measured; Qm, the mean of Q-values in a single specimen; \\nn, the number of spores measured per specimen; s, the number of specimens involved. \\nSpecimens are deposited in the Herbarium of Cryptogams, Kunming Institute of Botany \\nof the Chinese Academy of Sciences (KUN) and Herbarium of Guangdong Institute of \\nMicrobiology (GDGM). Authors of fungal names are cited according to the International \\nPlant Names Index Authors website (http://www.ipni.org/ipni/authorsearchpage.do). \\nGenomic DNA was isolated from dried specimens and the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 segment \\nfrom the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified with primer sets ITS1 (5’-TCC GTA \\nGGT GAA CCT GCG G-3’) and ITS4 (5’-TCC TCC GCT TAT TGA TAT GC -3’) by \\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques (White et al. 1990). Amplified products \\nwere examined with agarose gel electrophoresis using a 2kb DNA marker. The amplified \\nPCR products were directly sequenced and deposited in GenBank.\\nTaxonomy\\n#Misc-exposition*]\\n[@ Marasmius pseudoconfertus T.H. Li & Chun Y.

It belongs to sect. Sicci series \\nLeonini based on a lack of pleurocystidia, a central well-developed stipe, and \\na pileipellis composed of Siccus-type broom cells. This fungus is most similar \\nto M. confertus Berk. & Broome, which differs in the smaller basidiospores \\n(8–10(12) × 4–5(6) µm) and presence of pleurocystidia (Pegler 1977, Wannathes \\net al. 2009).\\nThe new species also resembles M. corneri Wannathes et al., M. occultatus \\nHar. Takah., and M. rubricosus Mont., all belonging to sect. Sicci ser. Leonini \\nand sharing moderately large basidiomes and absence of pleurocystidia and \\nsetae. Marasmius corneri, however, can be distinguished easily by its orange \\nstriate to sulcate pileus and larger basidiospores (18–20 × 4–5 µm) (Wannathes \\net al. 2009). Marasmius occultatus differs in having light colored pileus, a \\nmore slender stipe (0.8–1.3 mm) and a lignicolous habitat (Takahashi 2000). \\nMarasmius rubricosus differs in its densely striate pileus and  slightly longer \\nbasidiospores (15–18 × 4–5.5 µm) (Singer 1976). \\nThe rDNA-ITS (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 segment) sequence of 692 bps of the new \\nspecies (HQ832733) differs from any known Marasmius sequences. Through \\na Blast search against the GenBank DNA database, only 160 bps of 5.8S of the \\nsequence match those of M. bondoi (EU935476, EU935474, EU935472, and \\nEU935477). The remaining parts (ITS1 and ITS2, occupying about 76.8% of the \\nwhole segment) of the sequence are so different that they are not comparable \\nwith any known sequences. Therefore, M. pseudoconfertus is considered distinct \\nbased on a combination of morphological and molecular characters.\\nMarasmius suthepensis Wannathes, Desjardin & Lumyong, Fungal Diversity 37: \\n288. 2009. \\nFigs 3–4\\n#Misc-exposition*]\\n[@ Pileus 8–22 mm broad, obtusely conical to convex, with or without an umbo, \\nsmooth to striate, glabrous or pruinose, dull, disc brownish orange (7C6-8) \\n#Description*]\\n[@ Marasmius pseudoconfertus sp. nov.

This fungus is distinguished by a unique combination of \\nfeatures that warrant its accommodation in a new genus, described here. \\nMaterials and methods\\nFreshly collected leaf laminae of Calamus thwaitesii Becc. (Arecaceae) were \\nsurface sterilized in 70% ethanol (1 min), 4% sodium hypochloride (3 min) and \\n70 % ethanol (30 s) and thoroughly rinsed in sterile distilled water. Each leaf \\nlamina was cut into 5 mm square pieces and plated on malt extract agar (MEA, \\nHiMedia) plates (9 cm diam., Borosil glass) with antibiotics incorporated \\n(composition in 1 L: 5 g malt extract, 20 g agar, 20 mg each of bacitracin, \\nneomycin, penicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline). The plates were incubated \\nat 25°C with diurnal light for 15 days. The fungus appeared on the surface of \\ncut leaf pieces as sporodochia. A pure culture of the fungus was obtained by \\ntransferring spores from the sporodochium into fresh MEA plates.\\n218 ...

This is the first report of the genus Masseeella from this country, raising the \\nnumber of rust genera known from Pakistan to twenty-two.\\nKey words — Euphorbiaceae, macrocyclic rust, Neelum valley\\nIntroduction\\nFlueggea virosa is a dioecious, multi-stemmed, fast-growing bushy shrub in the \\nEuphorbiaceae. It is common in deciduous woodlands and on forest margins, \\nalong rivers, and in rocky areas and is widely distributed in Asia, Africa, and \\nAustralia. In Pakistan, it is found in Sindh, the Kaghan Valley, and Kashmir \\n(Stewart 1972). In the Neelum Valley, Azad Kashmir, this plant was found \\nheavily infected by a rust fungus that belongs to an interesting rust genus, \\nMasseeella Dietel.\\nMasseeella was erected by Dietel (1895) based on M. capparis (Cooke) Dietel \\n[as “capparidis”] to accommodate a rust on Flueggea virosa in India and named \\nafter the famous English mycologist G.E. Massee (Cummins & Hiratsuka 2003). \\nThis genus is subtropical in distribution and restricted to the warm regions \\nof Asia in the Philippines as well as South Africa. All species of Masseeella \\nparasitize members of the family Euphorbiaceae and are macrocyclic and \\nautoecious (Thirumalachar 1943, Singh & Singh 1967). Masseeella flueggeae on \\nFlueggea virosa was described from the Philippines by Sydow & Petrak (1928) \\n454 ... Khalid, Afshan & Elahi\\nand has since been reported in Myanmar (Thaung 2005) and South Africa \\n(Doidge 1950). This rust has pycnidia, aecidia, and uredosori that are unknown \\nin the type species of the genus (Sydow & Petrak 1928, Cummins 1937). The \\npresent paper reports the occurrence of Masseeella flueggeae on Flueggea virosa \\nfor the first time in Pakistan. In addition, a noteworthy rust, Pucciniastrum \\npyrolae on Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. karakoramica, is reported here as a new \\nhost record in Pakistan.\\nMaterials and methods\\nRusted specimens were collected in Azad Kashmir, Neelum Valley, Lawat and \\nnorthern areas, Fairy Meadows, Pakistan. Freehand sections of infected tissues \\nand spores were mounted in lactophenol and gently heated to a boiling point. \\nThe preparations were observed under a NIKON YS 100 microscope. Spores \\nand sori were drawn using a camera lucida (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar, Germany). \\nSpores were measured with an ocular micrometer. At least 25 spores were \\nmeasured for each spore state. The specimens were deposited in the Herbarium \\nof the Botany Department, University of the Punjab, Lahore (LAH).\\nRecorded species\\n#Misc-exposition*]\\n[@ Masseeella flueggeae Syd., Ann.

Pulvinula Boud. (Pyronemataceae, Ascomycota) has not previously been \\nreported from the Mexican mycobiota (Medel & Guzman 1999, Medel 2007), \\nand only four species of Phellodon P. Karst. (Bankeraceae, Basidiomycota) have \\nbeen reported from Mexico: Phellodon alboniger (Peck) Banker, P. confluens \\n(Pers.) Pouzar, P. melaleucus (Sw. ex-Fr.) P. Karst., and P. niger (Fr.) P. Karst. \\n(Cifuentes 1999). \\nMaterials & methods\\nSpecimens were collected from a pine–oak forest in the Mexican state of Jalisco, and \\ndeposited at the herbarium of the Institute of Botany of the University of Guadalajara, \\nMexico (IBUG). Macro- and micro-morphological descriptions and drawings were \\nmade of the studied materials. Photographs of fruiting bodies are provided for each \\ntaxon. Microscopic sections were mounted in a 3% KOH aqueous solution and Melzer’s \\nreagent. Specimens were identified after consulting Cifuentes (1999), Dennis (1970, \\n1978), Maas-Geesteranus (1975), Hall & Stuntz (1971), and Stalpers (1993).\\n962 ...

Jalisco: Municipality of San Sebastián del Oeste, \\nCamino Real Alto – La Bufa, 5.5 km del pueblo de San Sebastián del Oeste, 1 Aug 2009, \\nM. Herrera 1260 (IBUG).\\nHabitat — On soil and needle litter, gregarious, in pine-oak.\\nComments — Phellodon tomentosus is characterized by circular stipitate \\nbasidiomes that form into small colonies of five or six specimens with fused \\npilei, each pileus having its own independent stipe. Although cheilocystidia \\nhave not previously been reported for Phellodon species (Maas-Geesteranus \\n1975, Pegler et. al. 1997, Stalpers 1993), we observed cheilocystidia over the \\nentire hymenial surfaces of our material.\\nThe macro- and micro-morphological features agree with those described \\nby Breitenbach & Kränzlin (1986). Phellodon tomentosus can be confused with \\nsome Hydnellum species based on context and stipe zonation, but Hydnellum \\ncan be differentiated microscopically by its brown spores. \\nPhellodon tomentosus is a widely distributed but uncommon species; it is \\nreported as mycorrhizal on conifers (Pegler et al. 1997) and in mixed forests \\n(Maas-Geesteranus 1975).\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe authors are grateful to Dra.

The computational demands tested our available compute platform. The performance of the model as of current writing is terrible--out of a million lines of text it finds only 73 lines of Description, 175223 UNKNOWN_None, no lines of Nomenclature and the rest as Misc-exposition. As expected increasing the number of epochs increases training accuracy and decreases the loss function, but confusingly it performs identically on the test set no matter how many epochs are used.\n",

    "## Appendix: On the use of an AI Coder\n",
    "\n",
    "Portions of this work were completed with the aid of Claude Code Pro. I wish to give a clarifying example of how I've used this very powerful tool, and reveal why I am comfortable with claiming authorship of the resulting code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project I needed results from an earlier class project in which a trio of students built and evaluated models for classifying paragraphs. The earlier work was built as a iPython Notebook, with many examples and inline code. Just copying the earlier notebook would have introduced many irrelevant details and would not further the overall project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked Claude Code to translate the notebook into a module that I could import. It did a pretty good job. Without being told, it made a submodule, extracted the illustrative code as examples, wrote reasonable documentation, and created packaging for the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skill level of the coding was roughly that of a highly disciplined average junior programmer. The architecture was simplistic and violated several design constraints such as DRY. I requested specific refactorings, such as asking for a group of functions to be converted into an object that shared duplicated parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial code used REST interfaces directly, and read all the data into a single machine, not using pyspark correctly. Through a series of refactorings, I asked that the code use appropriate libraries I named, and create correct udf functions to execute transformations in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "I walked the AI through creating an object that I could use to illustrate my use of redis and couchdb interfaces, while leaving the irrelevant details in a separate library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, I still have to understand good design principles. I have to be able to recognize where appropriate libraries were applicable. I still have to understand the frameworks I am working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "I now have a strong understanding of the difference between \"vibe coding\" and AI-assisted software engineering. In my first 4 hours with Claude Code, I was able to produce roughly 4 days' worth of professional-grade working code.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm still learning how to use Claude Code effectively for debugging. Feeding it a series of error messages leads to increasingly convoluted code. Using it to help produce a small test program which I can hand inspect seems to work better. I've had moderate success with \"Run the test program and correct any errors.\", especially where I'm willing to review each edit as it is produced."
