# models

These are saved models. They are very large and can (and should) be
regenerated with the latest training data.

The two upcfg models, m_nom.joblib and m_bib.joblib are generated by
upcfg.ipynb.

The other two files, classifier_* and vectorizer_* (one model) were
generated from the finder.py command-line with the --dump_classifier
and --dump_vectorizer.
